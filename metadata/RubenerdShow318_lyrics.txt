50:15 – Drizzly data centre trips, birds, cryptographic randomness (lava lamps, headphone cables as sources of entropy), uber-ing a crowdsourced paradigm of synergising disruption, listener feedback (Jimbo, Bi-Coastal Becky), hoarses [sic], Jimbo interviewing me on his podcast, Kevin Tan, functionally-challenged data centre bathrooms, trudging through the rain, high school athletics I didn't suck at (gymnastics, badminton), winning a primary school writing contest, and finding the chipset from the first computer I built in 1998. Now with all-new abrupt endings!
