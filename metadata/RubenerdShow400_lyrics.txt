01:06:42 – It’s the four hundredth episode of my sporadic podcast! In lieu of formal celebrations, I discuss the surreal circumstances within which we find ourselves, along with various other ruminations about the holidays, significant figures, keyboard memories, ranting about fires, LPs, and more. Thank you so much for listening to my silly audible emissions, here’s to the next 400. ♡
