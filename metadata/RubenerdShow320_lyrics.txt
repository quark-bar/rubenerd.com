40:26 – A mini heatwave and monsoon, psychological torture, taking the stairs in lieu of lifts, Sydney’s expensive New Year fireworks, late 1990s DirectX graphics, feeling like the world is a simulation, viewing empty skylines, nihilism and being the only real person, beautiful bird sounds, evening storms, taxis targeting pedestrians, a sufficiently vast universe to harbour other life, evolution, holodecks, philosophical honesty, rendering the world around humans, the observer effect, and that darn Star Trek Prime Directive!
