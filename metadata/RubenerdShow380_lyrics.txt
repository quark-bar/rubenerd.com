28:02 – This could be the least-inspired episode title ever! But for a good cause, discussing the Mitsubishi 380, Farmer’s Union Iced Coffee, a Rubenerd Show clip from 2005, and other Adelaide nostalgia. Also making a coffee live on the programme, poorly-sized thermos containers, and a recurring sneeze.
