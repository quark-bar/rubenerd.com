54:03 – Returning to the birthplace and spiritual home of the Rubenerd Show in Singapore, and where I first heard The Overnightscape. Wandering around Marina Square with Clara making random observations about life here compared to the 1990s and 2000s, with sounds of the Singapore F1 Grand Prix in the background. Then jumping on the MRT back to Novena, and walking in the late evening. It’s a remote-working holiday, but I’ll take it!
