29:48 – Frank and Manny graciously showed us around New Jersey, and recorded such an epic Overnightscape I didn't bother doing my own show from there! To keep the chronology of episodes accurate, this is a quick recap of this part of our trip, recorded back around my dad's new place in North Arm Cove. Intro by ZAGAT.
