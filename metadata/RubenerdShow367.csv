rubenerdshow,Ruben Schade,Kyoto, Japan,Ruben Schade,2017-08-07,<p><strong>01:01:11</strong> – Ruben wanders back from Namba to their Airbnb in Osaka, rambling about visually impaired assistance, political posters, Japanese curry, police, pachinko, lack of street names, complicated bathrooms, and Mashu/Shielder from Fate/Grand Order. Then Clara and Ruben wander around Ninna-ji in Kyoto chatting about the <em>Rurouni Kenshin</em> films, anime flashback episodes, and mushrooms. Then over to Arashiyama talking about soba and Kyoto tofu, beautiful scenery around the Katura River, Kyoto trolley trains, bamboo forests, rickshaws, late-opening shops, and the Togetsukyo bridge. Recorded 29–30th July 2017. Sounds from the Osaka and Kyoto subways, and some spontaneous street music.</p><p style="font-style:italic" class="show-licence">Recorded in Kyoto, Japan.
