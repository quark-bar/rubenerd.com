25:23 – Not knowing a place till you leave it, the fascinating triangular windows of the old Belle Vue in Singapore, faded knock-off Lego blocks, Albert Einstein’s travels, finding new coffee shops, apothecary tables, government posters, a 1990s-era glass foyer, and a borderline rant on my butterfly Apple keyboard. Recorded early May 2020.
