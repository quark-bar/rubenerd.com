22:41 – The first in a short show series documenting my last week as a 20-something! Chatting about fire escapes, what you're supposed to do for your 30th, a win for shins and legal bicycle parkers everywhere, well intentioned ads that are probably not effective, a world without humans, and a really amazing rainbow.
