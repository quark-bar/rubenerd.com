The George Foreman Grill episode.

51:34 â€“ Feeling globally displaced, the Australian International School Singapore, the HSC and IB and Singapore A-Levels, loud planes (hush kits, airport curfews, restrictions), perfect is the enemy of good (Voltaire, podcast audio gear, Nespresso, the Renaissance Podcasters lamenting quality, hipsters, cameraphones), cruises to buy vinyl turntables, AKG reference headphones, office desk layouts (fight or flight, feng shui), and a far too long digression into making jaffles in a George Foreman grill.
