23:59 – The third in a short show series documenting my last week as a 20-something! Chatting about rattling Sydney tin can trains, the previous triple digit episode (Rubenerd Show 222 nine years ago), and the oddly specific power board café culture in Malaysia, Singapore and Australia. Was almost 24:00!
