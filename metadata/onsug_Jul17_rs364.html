<p class="show-description"><strong>24:21</strong> – Join Ruben and Clara on the tarmac of the old Kai Tak Airport as they discuss their current trip to Hong Kong! Topics include the Kowloon Walled City, comparing Hong Kong to Singapore and New York, the view from Victoria Peak, monsoon rains, lemons, and other topics discussed in the first person. We ran out of time, so the next episode will be from Osaka. 唔該.</p>
