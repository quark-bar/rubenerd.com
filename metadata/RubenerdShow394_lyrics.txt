43:59 – Join Ruben in a soulful, bronchital state; a word that almost certainly doesn’t exist. Topics include Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, secret apartment doors, Apple keyboards really are that bad, stabbing myself in the eye with a poster, Australia’s obsessive coffee culture, Arashiyama in Kyoto, and accidental beverages. Break song by the delightful Good Mythical Morning gents who trained a predictive text bot.

Released April 2019 on Rubenerd and The Overnightscape Underground, an Internet talk radio channel focusing on a freeform monologue style, with diverse and fascinating hosts; this one notwithstanding.
