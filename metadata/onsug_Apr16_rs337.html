<p class="show-description"><strong>28:22</strong> – Now that I'm thirty (GULP), a rambling episode about having my card skimmed in a taxi. Also failed burnouts, beeeeees, the Sydney housing bubble, burglaries, listener feedback (Marc and Shambles), missing an Overnightscape Central, Windows 95 nostalgia, sprinklers, and introverted office cacti.</p>
