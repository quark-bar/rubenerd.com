26:16 – This may be the worst episode of the show ever recorded. Its saving graces were a few clips from the Hypothetical Institute, one of the non-Onsug shows Ruben listens to. Topics include illness, backmasking, and the only appropriate way to unsubscribe from email. Don't listen to it! Or just skip to the clips.
