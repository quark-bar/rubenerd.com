29:37 – Join Ruben for a late-night wander around the abandoned Sydney suburb of Chatswood during these lockdown adventures. Topics include 100 days of COVID-19, stairwall-derived exercise, Australia and New Zealand’s potential new travel bubble, finding coffee shops, spooky silhouettes in the night, a Liverpool FC barber, JoAnne Hook paintings, active voice, saying “you too!” to retail staff, and the uncanny valley as it pertains to… sheep‽ Recorded Monday 4th May 2020.
