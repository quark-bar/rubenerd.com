<p class="show-description"><strong>01:22:00</strong> – Travelling back to Adelaide, where I first went to university and where most of the early <em>Rubénerd Shows</em> were recorded in 2005! Clara from the <a href="http://onsug.com/archives/category/clara">Snake Tea Podcast</a></em> joins in the pontifications about this beautiful little Australian city as we wander late at night. So much has stayed the same, yet so much has changed. Goodbye, Isobar!</p>
