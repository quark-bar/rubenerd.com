<p class="show-description"><strong></strong> – Join Ruben as he discusses himself in the third person, and his business trip adventures to two Australian cities on the exact opposite sides of the country for added convenience; the former of which he hadn’t been to since he lived there in the 1990s! Then some nostalgia for coffee chains, specifically the giant Dômes in Singapore. Recorded early September 2019.</p>
