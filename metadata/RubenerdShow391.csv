rubenerdshow,Ruben Schade,Sydney, Australia,Ruben Schade,2019-03-16,<p><strong>01:12:50</strong> â€“ It's another Rubenerd Squish, where I stick a few unrelated episodes into one! <strong>Part one</strong> discusses the most bizarre advertisement I've ever seen, in an audio journey through a 1970s era shopping centre that has barely changed. <strong>Part two</strong> discusses fabric couches, fun with spirometry, the Clipboard Mafia, and certain frustrating podcast ads. <strong>Part three</strong> discusses duopolistic allegiances, and fun with reverb-berb-reverb.
