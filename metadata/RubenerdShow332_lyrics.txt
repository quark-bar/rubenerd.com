33:13 – The second in a short show series documenting my last week as a 20-something! Chatting about warping lift shafts, colourful language for falling, an international Onsug, blocking websites, scripting away podcast chores, Akiyama Mio’s infamous K-On! scene, mail servers, Netflix, dead file sharing service nostalgia (aka Napster), and paying someone to do it for you!
