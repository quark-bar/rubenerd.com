<p class="show-description"><strong>29:48</strong> – Frank and Manny graciously showed us around New Jersey, and recorded such an <a href="http://onsug.com/archives/21514">epic Overnightscape</a> I didn't bother doing my own show from there! To keep the chronology of episodes accurate, this is a quick recap of this part of our trip, recorded back around my dad's new place in North Arm Cove.
