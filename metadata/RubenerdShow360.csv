rubenerdshow,Ruben Schade,Sydney, Australia,Ruben Schade,2017-04-24,<p><strong>01:29:42</strong> – Because it's episode 360! Shaddup. Take a wander with your esteemed host as he records three separate episodes, doesn't have time to produce all of them, and subsequently smashes them into one convenient episode. In Buzzfeed style, you'll never guess what he talks about! Mostly because the episode doesn't have a proper description.</p><p style="font-style:italic" class="show-licence">Recorded in Sydney, Australia.
