41:36 – I'm in Tokyo for AsiaBSDCon 2018 and annual leave. Too much audio to process! So for now, have this clip of Clara and I talking about our day trip to Odawara. Topics include the Train Simulator route of yore that inspired the trip, the Odakyu Luxury Super Express, walking past restaurants, Clara cat spotting, dango balloons, Odawara Castle, Ito En milk coffee, Denny's, ikiben, shiba inu dogs, Foursquare/Swarm, and getting back to Kudanshita.
