30:06 – A Christmas special coming to you from a Sydney Boxing Day in the heat of summer! Topics include a winter trip in Germany and Ireland, yuletide family traditions, how others celebrate or don’t, the best holiday foods from the UK and Germany, music, and a somewhat minor personal inconvenience! Also retiring the Rubenerd Annexe, self-titled Blogging Experts, a shoutout to Radio Free Shambles and The Midnight Citizen, and best wishes for the season.
