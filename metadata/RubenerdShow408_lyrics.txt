39:20 â€“ Wandering around a deserted Chatswood late at night, peeking into the empty stores, and watching the regular stream of empty commuter and metro trains roll by. Discussing working from home, trying to reconnect with music, critiquing streaming services, and a rose tinted view of audio tape.
