58:04 – Quiet neighbourhoods near Mardi Gras, a heart scare, work-life balance, answering Jimbo’s synchronicity questions, placebo beverages, acquired tastes, acquired skills, American comics, tea, nostalgia for American restaurants in Singapore (A&W, Applebees, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, Carl’s Jr, Kenny Rogers Roasters) and the world’s most epic muffins!
