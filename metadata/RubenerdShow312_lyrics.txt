01:22:00 – Travelling back to Adelaide, where I first went to university and where most of the early Rubénerd Shows were recorded in 2005! Clara from the Snake Tea Podcast joins in the pontifications about this beautiful little Australian city as we wander late at night. So much has stayed the same, yet so much has changed. Goodbye, Isobar!
