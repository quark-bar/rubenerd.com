<p class="show-description"><strong>10:55</strong> – I found my first attempt at rebooting the <em>Rubénerd Show</em> from January 2013! Topics included time stamp counters, audible tangents, tea, being back in Sydney, and torched coffee shops. Two years later, the show <a href="https://rubenerd.com/show275/">restarted for good</a> with an episode that didn't abruptly end with a door opening.</p>
