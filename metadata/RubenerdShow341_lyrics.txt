01:00:00 – Procuring and philosophising the nature of footwear, leaves, sirens, what the frick is “smart casual”, the Australian International School Singapore’s bowling team, evil insomnia and sleep debt, late night data centre trips, Mercury transiting the sun, pronouncing “vehicle” in true crime shows, resurrecting old theme songs, Van Morrison, and follow-up about decluttering. Thanks to PQ Ribber and Jimbo for their audio contributions!
