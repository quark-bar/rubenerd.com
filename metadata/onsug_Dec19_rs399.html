<p class="show-description"><strong>28:40</strong> â€“ Bushfires have engulfed Sydney for more than a week now, so it was a relief and joy to wander around back in Melbourne on a business trip with blue skies, even if only for a couple of days! Talking about the inevitable comparisons between Sydney and Melbourne, Stanley Kubrick-inspired data centres, health nonsense about Kombucha, tree-lined streets, and wishing for a Ricoh GR III pocket camera.
