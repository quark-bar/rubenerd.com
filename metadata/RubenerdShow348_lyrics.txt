01:30:35 – A late night stroll into last year. Why you can’t schedule creativity, The Who, The Avalanches, cynics on Y2K, an abandoned shop, generic names, Pack n Send nostalgia, startups versus big corporates, being thankful, getting rid of crap, water white noise, parcel lockers, c-c-c-cold, expensive caffeine trips, and exploding coffee machines. Recorded 30th June 2016.
