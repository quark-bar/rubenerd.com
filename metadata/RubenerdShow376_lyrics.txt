46:01 – Working from the San Fransisco office of the company I work for the next month, so I went wandering around Mission Rock, Embarcadero, the Bay Bridge, the docks, and a bit around the office. I’d write a more detailed description, but I’m doing double Australian and American shifts right now! Recorded over a week in late June 2018.
