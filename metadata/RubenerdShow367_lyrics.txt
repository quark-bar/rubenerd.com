01:01:11 – Ruben wanders back from Namba to their Airbnb in Osaka, rambling about visually impaired assistance, political posters, Japanese curry, police, pachinko, lack of street names, complicated bathrooms, and Mashu/Shielder from Fate/Grand Order. Then Clara and Ruben wander around Ninna-ji in Kyoto chatting about the Rurouni Kenshin films, anime flashback episodes, and mushrooms. Then over to Arashiyama talking about soba and Kyoto tofu, beautiful scenery around the Katura River, Kyoto trolley trains, bamboo forests, rickshaws, late-opening shops, and the Togetsukyo bridge. Recorded 29–30th July 2017. Sounds from the Osaka and Kyoto subways, and some spontaneous street music.
