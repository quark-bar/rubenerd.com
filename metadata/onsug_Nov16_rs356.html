<p class="show-description"><strong>01:01:01</strong> – This is a very special episode of the Rubénerd Show, possibly the best one ever. In a cute Philadelphia coffee shop in October 2016, I finally got to sit down with Jim Kloss; mentor, online confidant and dear friend. We set the record straight on Whole Wheat Radio, the pioneering independent online music community; and the <a href="http://www.bbsdocumentary.com/software/IBM/DOS/NOCHANGE/">NOCHANGE BBS</a> system with its ingenious two factor authentication system and delightful inception. Along with <a href="http://theovernightscape.com/">Frank Nora</a> and <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=site%3Arubenerd.com+israel+brown&amp;t=ffsb&amp;ia=web">Israel Brown</a>, Jim was the reason I started this audio magazine in 2005. It was a delight, and an honour to talk with him. I hope you feel the magic I did.</p>
