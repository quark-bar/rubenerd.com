The Overnightscape Central is a spectacularly fun podcast on the Overnightscape Underground (Onsug) network. Each week, P.Q. Ribber solicits entries from network hosts (like me!) on a range of topics, from breakfast cereal and weird holiday memories, to Spiderman and science fiction.

I'm Ruben Schade, host of the Rub√©nerd Show on the network. This was one of my submissions.
