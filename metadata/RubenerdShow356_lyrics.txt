01:01:01 – This is a very special episode of the Rubénerd Show, possibly the best one ever. In a cute Philadelphia coffee shop in October 2016, I finally got to sit down with Jim Kloss; mentor, online confidant and dear friend. We set the record straight on Whole Wheat Radio, the pioneering independent online music community; and the NOCHANGE BBS system with its ingenious two factor authentication system and delightful inception. Along with Frank Nora and Israel Brown, Jim was the reason I started this audio magazine in 2005. It was a delight, and an honour to talk with him. I hope you feel the magic I did.
