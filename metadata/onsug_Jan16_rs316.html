<p class="show-description"><strong>44:53</strong> – The first episode of 2016! Join Ruben on a stunning morning in Sydney's Circular Quay as he watches the ferries go past the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge. Also inexplicable discussion on traffic helicopters, naming anime episodes in Plex, puddled iron in the Eiffel Tower, palm trees, Running Man, Americans who like Vegemite, disappointing San Fran coffee, alternate terms for podcasting, The Rocks precinct, and what's possibly Australia's oldest surviving house. <Photo panorama of the recording location also provided on <a href="https://archive.org/details/RubenerdShow316/RecordingLocationPano.jpg">Archive.org</a>!</p>
