<p class="show-description"><strong>49:25</strong> – Spicy Thai food, student housing mates, finding out we have Danish relatives, IKEA trips (the wonderful new cafés, custom tables, impulse purchasing), the coffee triangle, remembering David Bowie and Alan Rickman (mix tapes, fabulousness, ultimate villains), stupid things said about their passing (keeping their sicknesses a “secret”, that they “looked” healthy), re-recording episodes, jobs, and the ever-elusive letterbox key from strata.</p>
