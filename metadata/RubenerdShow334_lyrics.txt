32:45 – Show four of six documenting my last days before turning 30! Chatting about data centre noise, keycard silliness, submerging computers, running across streets, family religion, increasingly scared about turning 30, a drag-racing Kia and Maserati, Candanavian [sic] and Irish weather and landscapes, Frank Nora pointing out difference between holidays and vacations, and alienating people with poorly-imitated accents.
