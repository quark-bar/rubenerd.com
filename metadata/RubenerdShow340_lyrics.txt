52:57 – Constant construction, preferring apartments to houses (though inconsiderate people suck!), beautiful garden landscapes, humans needing nature for wellbeing, leaf crunching, evil Bondi Beach, weird new truck beeping sounds, restoring Big Ben, Eiffel Tower lifts, the new Mascot woolies, shopping centre and mall exploration, and feeling boxed in by having too much stuff, so getting rid of half of it!
