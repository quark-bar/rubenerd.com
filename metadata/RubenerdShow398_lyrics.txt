24:32 – The Rubenerd Show returns to Kuala Lumpur after thirteen years! Playing a retrospective clip from episode 103 in June 2006, then back to October 2019 with Clara wandering around the Petronas Twin Towers and Jalan Ampang. I never thought I’d be doing this again!

Released October 2019 on Rubenerd and The Overnightscape Underground, an Internet talk radio channel focusing on a freeform monologue style, with diverse and fascinating hosts; this one notwithstanding.
