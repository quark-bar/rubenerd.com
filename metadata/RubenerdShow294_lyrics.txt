The Emperor's Puff episode

29:00 – The official park studios of the show, getting weird looks, insomnia, the Renaissance Podcaster obsession with “nuance”, street lamps in parks, shadows on grass, Chinese vegetarian food (Chinatown in Sydney, Emperor’s Puffs, Kopitiam and hawker centres in Singapore), Australia has a new Prime Minister (the party spill motion, Turnbull, Abbott, Rudd, Gillard), the Westminster System, tiring of political cynicism, and the glorious placebo effect of pushing pedestrian-crossing buttons.
