<p class="show-description"><strong>26:16</strong> – This may be the worst episode of the show ever recorded. Its saving graces were a few clips from the <a href=http://hypotheticalinstitute.podbean.com>Hypothetical Institute</a>, one of the non-Onsug shows Ruben listens to. Topics include illness, backmasking, and the only appropriate way to unsubscribe from email. Don't listen to it! Or just skip to the clips.</p>
