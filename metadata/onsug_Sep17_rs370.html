<p class="show-description"><strong>20:44</strong> – Quick report from a business trip to Canberra, with unreality, Australia’s worst Thai food, evil vending machines,  cashew bags, flight delays, and other fun. Then back to Sydney for an apology to Jimbo and fascinating, though dusty, construction sites. Recorded 30th August and 25th September 2017.</p>
