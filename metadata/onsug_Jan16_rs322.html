<p class="show-description"><strong>52:35</strong> – Anyone will tell you it’s a prison island, hidden in the summer for a million years. Happy Australia Day with this discussion of what should be the anthem, Captain Cook, our native peoples, where we all live, cliché Australian tourism advertising, Outback Steakhouse, and humbling flights over the desert. Topped off with a <a href="http://onsug.com/archives/18940">Midnight Citizen-inspired discussion</a> on rapidly fading music and book retail (Coconuts, Borders, Angus & Robertson, Tower Records, HMV in Singapore, the magical late 1990s), and the darn space all those books and DVDs take up. Released late because work has been tough, hope it was worth it!</p>
