The midnight kookaburra episode.

58:38 â€“ Reviving old theme songs, having empathy for people (but it doesn't always excuse stuff!), the Indonesian forest fire haze in Singapore and Malaysia, needing more nice people rather than successful people, self preservation, Steven Colbert's moving interview of Joe Biden, getting away from "left-right wing" labels, personas, children raising parents, power rendering people douchebags, hippies, renumeration irrespective of jobs, using cameraphones as cameras (iPhone 6s+, Nokia Lumia), traditional cameras (Nikon D60, FinePix S9600, X-T1, X-100s), podcast elitism, car bubbles, and impromptu birds.
