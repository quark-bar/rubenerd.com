<p class="show-description"><strong>24:32</strong> – The Rubenerd Show returns to Kuala Lumpur after thirteen years! Playing a retrospective clip from <a href="https://rubenerd.com/show103/">episode 103</a> in June 2006, then back to October 2019 with Clara wandering around the Petronas Twin Towers and Jalan Ampang. I never thought I’d be doing this again!</p>
