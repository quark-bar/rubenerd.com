<p class="show-description"><strong>23:59</strong> – The third in a short show series documenting my last week as a 20-something! Chatting about rattling Sydney tin can trains, the previous triple digit episode (<a href="https://rubenerd.com/show222/">Rubenerd Show 222</a> nine years ago), and the oddly specific power board café culture in Malaysia, Singapore and Australia. Was <em>almost</em> 24:00!</p>
