<p class="show-description"><strong>46:14</strong> – An unsurprisingly holiday-themed episode of the show, with discussion on musical cheer (or hipster lack thereof!), Christmas in the media (with Australian news clips), fond family memories, and likely far more stuff that your host can't recall because he's royally stuffed with Christmas Eve dinner and can barely think. Seasons Greetings!</p>
