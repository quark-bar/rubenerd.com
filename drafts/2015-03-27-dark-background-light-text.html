<p>After a nine year interlude, Rub√©nerd now has a dark background, light text theme again. A few quick reasons why:</p>

<ul>
<li>Eye floaters (cries)</li>
<li>The times of day I tend to write posts</li>
<li>Nostalgia</li>
</ul>

<p>My personal preference was always for darker backgrounds, but I knew I was in the minority. We still are, but now I don't care.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how long this will last, but let's give it a try.</p>
