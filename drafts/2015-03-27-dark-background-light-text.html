<p>After a nine year interlude, Rub√©nerd is back on the dark
background with light text it was launched with in 2004. A few
quick reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eye floaters (cries)</li>
<li>The times of day I tend to write posts</li>
<li>Nostalgia</li>
</ul>
<p>My personal preference was always for dark backgrounds, but I
knew I was in the minority. We still are, but now I don't care.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how long this will last, but let's give it a
try.</p>
