--- layout: "Failing to volume licence a Windows Server" ---
<p>If you're in charge of volume Windows Licencing, even as an
atheist I say "godspeed". In my case, I didn't realise I'd
generated the wrong key (a KMS) from the Volume Licencing Center
(the correct spelling would be Licencing Centre). KMS keys require
a key server to authenticate to, which we didn't have.</p>
<p>If you attempt activation when a key server isn't available:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Error 0xC004F050 The Software Licensing Service reported that
the product key is invalid</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Windows Volume Licencing Center, use the MAK key instead.
Then, from the Command Prompt or PowerShell or whatever the cool
people are using these days:</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt;slmgr -ipk [key]-[key]-[key]-[key]-[key]
</pre>
<p>If this key is valid, you'll get this Windows Script Host
message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Installed product key [..] successfully</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phew.</p>
