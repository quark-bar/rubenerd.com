<p>I have a restraining order against anything post-XP, but I did grow up using Windows. In particular, I have an affinity for Windows NT 3.51, released in 1995 shortly before Windows 95.</p>

<p>Architecturally and graphically, NT 3.51 represented a unique situation in the early 1990s. Microsoft and IBM had parted ways by that stage, and Redmond had been selling what they'd developed as NT. It was far more advanced than 95 and could also run 32bit applications, but conversely it contained the final refinement to the 3.x interface.

<p>Because of this, you could run most Windows 95 applications, with their new UI widgets, in an environment that looked like Windows 3.1. I thought that was utterly trippy.</p>

<p>It's predecessors were harder to virtualise, not least becauase they restrict the CPUs they'll accept. But NT 3.51 is 

<p>Grab yourself a DOS boot disk image. Donâ€™t format the drive with a Windows 95 or later disk, because FDISK will create a partition layout the NT installer will choke on.</p>

<p>Boot from the disk, run FDISK and set out your partitions.</p>

<p>You have several ways to run the installer. I run X:\I386\WINNT.EXE off the CD, after booting from a boot disk with CD-ROM drivers.</p>
