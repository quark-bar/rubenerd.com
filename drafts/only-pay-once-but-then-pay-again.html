<p>Atlassian's pricing page for Confluence lists the following server benefits:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Server Benefits</p>

<ul>
<li>Host on your own hardware.</li>
<li>Extreme customization.</li>
<li>Perpetual license: one-time purchase.</li>
<li>Add-ons available from Atlassian Marketplace.</li>
<li>Complete application control.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>A perpetual licence. Get Confluence with a "one-time purchase". Sounds delightfully simple, but alas it's more complicated. On their purchase page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All software purchases include 12 months of maintenance. Maintenance entitles you to product support and software updates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They then sell longer periods for maintenance.</p>

<p>This seems to be the new norm; sell something for a low price (or even give it away for free), then charge for ongoing support.</p>

<p>Is this the enterprise equivilent to mobile app stores giving away software with in-app purchases, or Adobe for end users with Creative Cloud?</p>
