title: "After nine years, he watches Fate/Stay Night"

<p>I've got an embarrassing confession to make. If you're anywhere on the spectrum of otaku, from casual fans to body pillow huggers, avert your eyes.</p>

<p>No, really, you're not prepared for this. Go back to your Hestia strings.</p>

<p>For someone who's professed to being a fan of TypeMoon art all these years; for all their beautiful graphics I've showcased on this site over the years; for all my talk about my favourite Saber anime figures... I'd never seen any of the anime. Or played the games. Worse still, I didn't even know which came first, what influenced what, why there were so mant different universes, or how many there were.</p>

<p>After <a href="">Clara</a> bought me a copy of ___ featuring the lovely Sakura, the farce of being a superficial fan of a franchise finally cut me like so many swords.</p>

<p>My first exposure was the Fate Stay Night Unlimited Blade works anime on Crunchyroll. Clara revelled in seeing the earlier story told from the perspective of Tosaka Rin, but I couldn't relate at all. So we're working through the 2004 anime first now, with the intention of watching Blade Works after.</p>

<p>The story isn't entirely what I was expecting. TypeMoon were first known for their ecchi games (so I found out), but save for Tosaka's legendary zettai ryouiki, there's no gratuitous fan service. The universe building that went into the premise is fascinating, even if I still don't completely grok it yet.</p>

<p>I also can't help but think of Monty Python whenever they discuss the Holy Grail.</p>
