title: "After nine years, he watches Fate/Stay Night"

<p>I've got an embarrassing confession to make. If you're anywhere on the spectrum of otaku, from casual fans to body pillow huggers, avert your eyes. No, really, you're not prepared for this.</p>

<p>For such a self-professed TypeMoon fan, for all their beautiful art I've showcased on this site over the years, for all my talk about my favourite Saber anime figures... I'd never seen any of the anime. Or played the games. Worse still, I didn't even know which came first, what influenced what. My knowledge came almost entirely from the tags on imageboards.</p>

<p>This finally changed over the weekend, when <a href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> and I watched the first few episodes of Fate/Stay Night. Suddently, I understood.</p>
