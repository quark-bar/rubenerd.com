title: "Log out of unused ttys"
---
<p>Say you have several open ttys on a machine, and you've since SSH'd in remotely and need to "close" them. You can log out of them with deallocvt, such as this for /dev/ttys3:</p>

<pre>
deallocvt 3
</pre>

<p>If you have any running processes in these, you'll need to close them first.</p>
