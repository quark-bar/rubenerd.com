<p>If you peruse the Xfce site, you'll see the screenshots include
a squarish icon theme. It's not the Mouse or Tango icons that
package managers and distros generally include by default with
their Xfce desktops.</p>
<p><em>Turns out</em>, it's Faenza. <a href=
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faenza">From Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Faenza (pronounced [faˈɛntsa]) is an Italian city and comune, in
the province of Ravenna, Emilia-Romagna, situated 50 kilometres (31
miles) southeast of Bologna.</p>
<p>Faenza is noted for its manufacture of majolica ware glazed
earthenware pottery, known from the name of the town as
"faience".</p>

<p>Well, that's clearly the wrong one. Still, I learned something
today.</p>
<p>Let's try that again. From the official (that I can see) Google
Code site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An icon theme for Gnome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, then. It's also listed on DeviantArt, that site that used
to have a cool logo.</p>
<p>Given Google Code is being deleted soon, you may want to
download this.</p>
