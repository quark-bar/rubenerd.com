<p>Growing up, I generally preferred building things to just
straight up gaming. Of course, gamers would be quick to point out
that I would have been building reflexes and other mental acuities
by playing certain games, but that's a tad pedantic. I just found
it more rewarding building things, from computers to Lego towns and
such.</p>
<p>With Lego, not "Legos". Next you'll be telling me you like
counting sheeps. You weird, weird peoples.</p>
<p>To that end, Maxis games were an absolute drug.
<em>A-Train</em>, <em>SimCity</em>, <em>SimPark</em> and
<em>SimTower</em>â€¦ all of these let us break away from the
constraints of affordability and house space into what we could
model and build on a computer. Cynics would roll their eyes at my
borderline <strong>synergised paradigm</strong> language there, but
it was really true.</p>
<p>And then there was <em>The Sims</em>, which took the macro level
task of building a city or skyscraper and boiled it down to the
family unit. I loved building futures for my little people, but the
houses were far and away my favourite part. I'd even convinced my
year 10 Design and Tech teacher to design a building mockup using
<em>The Sims</em> before I proceeded to butcher it with cardboard
and clay.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic">(For a brief period of time, I wanted
to be an architect. Frank Lloyd Wright, Art Deco, 70s Brutalism and
everything in between. Like all those other interests though, they
took a back seat to that glowing, CRT-fronted 486SX).</p>
<h3>That was a long introduction</h3>
<p>I preface this arguably short announcement with all this
nonsense to frame just how excited I am by this. With the release
of <em>The Sims 4</em> imminent, the legendary Mac game studio
Aspyr have re-released <em>The Sims 2</em> on the App Store,
including most of the expansions
<strong>pre-installed</strong>.</p>
<p>Reread that paragraph. Then look back at me. Then reread that
paragraph. Then look back at me.</p>
<p>Having remembered the fun it took getting <em>The Sims 1</em>
and all its expansions working on an Intel Mac with all these
PowerPC binaries and patches, and the QuickTime incompatibilities
with various later versions of Mac OS X that somehow prevented a
bunch of expansions working, this made me more excited than I care
to admit.</p>
<p>A ready to play app bundle with most of the expansions all
installed for us? YES PLEASE.</p>
<p>Of course, with TPG internet at our home, I had to download it
from the office. I also had to free over 16GB of drive space on a
64GB MacBook Air before the App Store would allow me to download
it. But there it was, a few hours later, shiny and ready to
play.</p>
<p>For those used to the classic game, there are a couple of nice
extras. Aspyr tells us they refactored the rendering engine for the
game, meaning it does play halfway decent even on an 11 inch Air
with integrated graphics. It can even be run in a window, so you
can stil tweet your excitement from TweetBot while you play.
They've done a really nice job.</p>
