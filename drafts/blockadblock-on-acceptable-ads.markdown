BlockAdBlock is a service that allows site owners to bypass advertising filters. I'm more interested in their blog, which I subscribe to for giving me both sides of the debate.

In one of their recent posts, the author cites AdBlock Plus's Acceptable Ads criteria:

1. Acceptable Ads are not annoying.
2. Acceptable Ads do not disrupt or distort the page content we’re trying to read.
3. Acceptable Ads are transparent with us about being an ad.
4. Acceptable Ads are effective without shouting at us.
5. Acceptable Ads are appropriate to the site that we are on.

And provides this analysis:

> Numbers 1 and 2 are ridiculous when one considers that most adblock users — if not most website visitors — tend to view all ads as annoying and disruptive. 

Some people will always block everything, so lets punish those who don't witha annoying ads that disrupt and distort page content.

> Number 4 is apparently a call for ads that are easy to ignore and forget about. 

And they "apparently" assume that for ads to be effective, they have to be shouting at us.

> And number 5 is a call to end visitor tracking, which has been one of the most profitable technological developments in ad-tech.

Says it all.

There are some legitimate defences for online advertising. These comments are not among them.
