Hi Frank and ONSUG team!

I have a confession to make. I've been listening to the ONS again for a few weeks now. I started listening in 2004, but around 2012 I slowly stopped. Maybe you can have too much of a good thing, maybe I needed a break, I'm not sure.

Last year, I met my high school friend Felix who I introduced to the ONS back in the day. We were both in transit in Singapore Airport at the same time, but for different reasons. Talk about a global syncronicity!

Much the same way, I feel the same about Frank. After a period of absense, I'm sitting sharing some exotic snack food in AC, or exploring typefaces in an obscure mall we reached by train.

A lot has changed since last time I listened. I feel Frank sounds more relaxed, more self depracating, and with way more vulgarity than before!
