left a review</a> of the Raspberry Pi Model A on the Tronixlabs
site.
<blockquote>
<p>I bought this from Tronixlabs shortly after it became available.
Wonderful little board and supplier :)</p>
<p>If you don't need all the IO and memory of a regular Pi, will be
interacting with it remotely and/or space and power consumption are
critical, the A may be your ticket.</p>
<p>The limited IO can be offset by utilising a serial console on
the GPIO riser, freeing the lone USB port for other uses. You can
wire your own with a MAX3232, which allows interfacing with the A's
3.3v serial with a regular 5v port.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there are plenty of after market integrated serial
boards, though this does eat into the cost saving of getting the A
over the B. Still, it still has the power and size advantages.</p>
