<p>Here in Australia, there's been an awful lot of press regarding Prime Minister Tony Abbott's plan to revoke the citizenship of people suspected of flying overseas to perform terrorism. More surprising has been the generally positive reaction to it.</p>

<p>Thing is, it's not his to revoke.</p>

<p>Because of my father's job, my sister and I grew up in Singapore. We weren't alone; more people live outside the countries of birth than ever before. Multinational companies, global finance and telecommunications (the internet, phones, etc) have enabled this to a degree unprecedented in world history.</p>

<p>For us, the yearly application for dependency and student green card extensions seemed normal. My passport was nominally Australian, but I had an official page and green card from Singapore Immigration permitting me to stay where I considered home.</p>

<p>As a kid, I remembered thinking "why do people who live where they're born not have to prove why they should stay?"</p>

<p>I like to think older me is wiser. Citizenship is bestowed on people for life, its a human right. If, after receiving it, there are better opportunities elsewhere, its their right to make that decision.</p>

<p>For governments, this has several glaring implcations. If their citizens contributions to society aren't being appreciated, they can just move elsewhere (they call it a brain drain). It renders people less patriotic, because they start to see themselves as global citizens. Its harder to recruit people who feel alegiences to people, not arbitrary nation states.</p>

<p>My sister and I would feel it. Entering Singapore, we were always greeting with care, respect, and free mints. Returning to Australia for holidays, and the border officials would look at us almost with scorn, as if they wanted to say "oh, I see, Australia not good enough for you?"</p>
