<p>I first used VMM back on Fedora. I was trying out Xen for the first time, and wanted a GUI interface for messing around with it, ala VirtualBox. While I ultimately learned to use the shell instead, it was still fun to play with Xen in such an environment.</p>
<p>Trying out this afternoon on Debian, I almost unwittingly installed this instead:</p>
<pre>
# apt-cache search vmm
==&gt; vmm - manage mail domains/accounts/aliases for Dovecot and Postfix
</pre>
<p>What we want is this:</p>
<pre>
# apt-get install virt-manager 
</pre>
<p>I suppose it goes without saying you need Xen. Or maybe QEMU as an alternative?</p>
<p>Since working here, Iâ€™ve also learned people in the know call it Qwem-you, not spelling out the acronym. I only ever used it at home and never heard it spoken.</p>
