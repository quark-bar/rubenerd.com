<p>This episode was recorded but never produced; it sat on my hard disk rotting in a backup folder for a few months before I salvaged it. I don&#39;t remember recording this episode, very spooky! Talking about the music I play on the show, good eating at the uni, still using my Tungsten W, talking to Laura Douglass again, the groovy Bank of South Australia Debit VISA, evil Centrelink, why Mac OS X&#39;s UNIX command line kicks ass over Windows&#39;s crappy DOS-emulated command line, and The Ruben Miracle Girl Repellent!</p>
