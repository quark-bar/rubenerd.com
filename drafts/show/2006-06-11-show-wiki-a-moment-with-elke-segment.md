The **A Moment with Elke Segment** involves the show's host [Ruben](http://rubenerd.com/show-wiki-ruben/) talking with his litle sister [Elke Schade](http://rubenerd.com/show-wiki-elke-schade/) about life, the universe and everything. When it is discovered every episode that Elke has not prepared for the segment at all and in fact just talks about random crap, humerous consequences arise.

Topics have included [Neopets](http://rubenerd.com/show-wiki-neopets/), why Ruben is a loser and what [KLCC](http://rubenerd.com/show-wiki-klcc/) stands for. 

### Current Status

As of June 2006, this segment is **active** whenever Ruben is in [Kuala Lumpur](http://rubenerd.com/show-wiki-kuala-lumpur), [Malaysia](http://rubenerd.com/show-wiki-malaysia/).
