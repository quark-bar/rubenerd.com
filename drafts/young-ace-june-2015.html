<p>This is my first manga magazine review. For someone who can read no Japanese, and only knows a handful of kanji from seeing Chinese in Singapore, it should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Still, the current issue of <em><a href="http://www.kadokawa.co.jp/ya/">Young Ace</a></em> is, to put it bluntly, amazeballs. You get:</p>

<ul>
<li>A largerâ€“than-life sized poster of Nagato Yuki, drawn by Noize Ito and even holding a can of coffee by her blushing face.</li>
<li>Even more colour Dissappearance Yuki art</li>
<li>A gorgeous document sleeve of ___ from the Fate universe</li>
<li>More colour Fate and Evangelion art</li> 
<li>A chapter of Sherlock, in their modern BBC rendition</li>
</ul>

<p>Kinokuniya sells them, but you can also <a href="">grab it from Amazon</a>.</p>
