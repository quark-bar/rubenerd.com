<p>This is my first manga magazine review. For someone who can read no Japanese, and only knows a handful of kanji from seeing Chinese in Singapore, it should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Still, the current issue of <em><a href="http://www.kadokawa.co.jp/ya/">Young Ace</a></em> is, to put it bluntly, amazeballs. I’ll let the Tokyo Otaku Mode team explain what you get:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Young Ace</em> is the monthly seinen manga magazine published by Kadokawa. Fans of Type-Moon will need to pick up this June 2015 issue as it features not only a <em>Fate/Stay Night</em> cover illustrated by Takashi Takeuchi, but also the beginning of the new <em>Heaven’s Feel</em> series written by Takeuchi and illustrated by Taskohna.</p>

<p>The magazine also sees the start of another new series this month - Kiss x Boku x Otome, and comes with a clear file featuring the Fate/Stay Night: Heaven’s Feel illustration by Takashi Takeuchi as seen on the cover, a giant The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan poster [of her holding coffee!], and the second serial code in the The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan x Idol Chronicle collaboration.</p>

<p>There’s also a chapter of the Sherlock manga adaptation which is almost <em>too</em> realistic. It’s quite scary.</p>

<p>Kinokuniya in Sydney sells them, but you can also grab it from <a href="https://otakumode.com/shop/552390e280116a976aa7df61">Tokyo Otaku Mode</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%83%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%82%A8%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B9-2015%E5%B9%B4-6%E6%9C%88%E5%8F%B7/dp/B00VFBVOPS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431178697&sr=8-1&keywords=young+ace">Amazon.co.jp</a>. I haven't yet figured out how to do affiliate links for those yet, so if you get this and love it as much as you know you will, feel free to buy a coffee using the link on the post page :’).</p>
