<p>Remember that guy who gained fame from being happy? It seems he does reserve scorn for some, that I can only assume he used ironically in some hipster way or something.</p>

<blockquote><p>With regard to "those who have concluded that God simply doesn’t exist", Pharrell Williams has stated: "It’s so incredibly arrogant and pompous. It’s amazing that there are people who really believe that"</p></blockquote>

<p>Amazing? Believe it, there's one right here :)</p>

<p>I assume he's referring to atheists, who are just as open to the idea of intelligence lurking somewhere out there. We just think the search is ongoing.</p>
