<p>I have a terrible confession to make. If you fall anywhere on the otaku to casual anime viewer spectrum, you'll likely want to cast your eyes elsewhere. I know many of you wont, but at least you won't be able to claim I didn't warn you.

<p>Since <em>The Melancholy of Haruhi Sumzumiya</em> rekindled my interest in anime from the <em>Sailor Moon</em> days, I've professed to be a fan of Type-Moon. Specifically, of their art; I've used samples of it here on Rubénerd for almost a decade. For example, the below image from my 2007 KDE machine:</p>

<p>Type-Moon's character designs, compositions, and use of colour and schading [sic] are among my favourites of any anime/game studio. I have their characters as anime figures. Saber will surely go down in the ages as one of the best characters ever envisioned, and if you disagree you're wrong.

<p>And yet, here comes the bombshell. You may want to re-read my disclaimer if you've made it this far despite being an anime viewer. Really, you're not ready for this.

<p>I haven't ever watched an episode of Fate/Stay Night. I'd never played the game. I didn't even know which came first. Fate/Zero, Fate/Hollow Ataraxia, I didn't know whether these were spinoffs or reboots or alternative universes. For all intents and purposes, my fandom for Type Moon was entirely superficial; based on art I otherwise loved but for which I had no understanding.

<p>With Clara's help, last week this finally changed. Through the awesomeness that is CrunchyRoll and the Apple TV, we sat down one evening and watched the first episode of <em>Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works</em>.  From what Clara told me, the series tells the story of the origins <em>Fate/Stay Night</em>, but from the perspective of Rin instead.

<p style="font-style: italic">As an aside, Tohsaka is one of my new favourite names. Specifically, it's fantastic to shout in passionate anger. Your train has been delayed by 20 minutes? <strong>TOH-SA-KAAAAAA!!!!</strong>.</p>

<p>Given such a story would be better enjoyed having seen the original, Clara and I have now been watching the original anime adaptation from 2004. The graphics are noticeably simpler from the current full-out production, but it still has that Type Moon style I was a fan of in still form.

<p>The good news is the plot and character development is so far meeting my expectations as an outside fan for so long. Hearing Saber speak in particular, having only ever seen her, was a fanboy moment! They've built quite the universe, which I'm interested to see explored (details of which I won't divisive for spoilers).

<p>Despite the more serious and “full on” setting, there are also brilliantly executed comedic moments. That's the douchy way of saying funny stuff happens, that doens't detract from the story. Then there are the moments when we see the otherwise cold and stoic Saber smile that make me fanboy more than I care to admit.</p>

<p>Indeed, Saber, Archer and Rin are all brilliant in their own ways. I wish I had the ripped muscles and commanding voice of Archer, or to have been born a woman so I could <em>zettai ryouki</em> the way Rin so galiently trailblased. No, really, that skirt-thighhigh gap has to be the greatest fashion invention of the 21st century, aside from cargo pants with build in smartphone chargers. I think I'll stop now.</p> 

<p>__, unfortunately, would be forgettable if he weren't so maddening. His heart is in the right place, and I'd likely treat a Servent the same way given the choice, but his failure to deduce even the most basic things from his circumstances, or follow instructions, render him impossible to emphathise with. A part of me wants him to lose a battle so he's made aware of the <em>consequences</em> of his actions!</p> 

<p>So there you have it. I'm excited to see where this story goes, depsite everyone else already knowing for a decade. If it doesn't end with Eric Idle handing them The Holy Grail, I'll be totes disappointed.</p>
