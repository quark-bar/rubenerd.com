<p>The ease (or lack thereof) of unsubscribing to newsletters is a recurring theme here. It’s such fertile ground.</p>

<p>Today's message comes from RealEstate.com.au:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You have been unsubscribed from receiving product announcement emails.</p>

<p>We may still send you other marketing communications from time to time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yikes. Unsubscribe means unsubscribe, not “mostly” unsubscribe. Fortunately, they had a “manage your email preferences link”, which took me to a login page, then an Email preferences screen with the follwing links.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Newsletters<br />
Welcome &amp; Member Emails<br />
Property journey tips and guides<br />
Market Announcements<br />
Realestate.com.au announcements<br />
Partner Offers<br />
Saves Search Alerts</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was no select all. Eight clicks, including the two from before, to unsubscribe.</p>
