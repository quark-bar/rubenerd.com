<p>My production machine at work is a <a href=
"https://debian.org/">Debian</a> box, so I've been relearning all
the <em>Year of the Linux Desktop</em> things. I couldn't remember
what I used to use as my RPN <a href=

weapon of choice</a>, but a quick apt-cache search found me this
<a href="http://galculator.sourceforge.net/" title=
"galculator, a GTK+ calculator">rather handsome</a> little unit by
Simon Floery.</p>
<p>If you're in <em>Scientific Mode</em>, you can just click
<code>RPN</code> in the display. Otherwise, choose <em>Reverse
Polish</em> from <em>Notation Modes</em> on the surprisingly‚Äêtitled
<em>Calculator</em> menu.</p>
<p>Update: Turns out that RPN calculator I used to use was the
<a href="http://rubenerd.com/hp-bevels-and-xcalc/">venerable
xcalc</a>. That could be activated in RPN mode, and themed. How
very retro, and meta.</p>
