<p>As American friends would lament posts like these as being a little too "Inside Baseball" (whatever that means), I've switched back to static site generation for Rubénerd, for the exact same reason I stopped doing so before.</p>

<p>Wait, what?</p>

<p>Like everyone reaching the end of their twenties, I'm realising the barrier to entry for my hobbies are time now, not technology. I'm still pigheaded enough to want to host my own material; as a tinkerer and "IT guy" I think it'll be a sad day when that's no longer true. So what can I do to blog with minimal effort, but with my own infrastructure?</p>

<p>For a couple of years, I thought Jekyll was the answer. Static generation <strong>drastically</strong> simplified my web server stack, and live previewing my site on my MacBook Air without internet was a boon. Ultimately though, 40 minutes to generate the site was a little silly, and I moved back to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/">enemy I know</a>.</p>

<h3>Enter Hugo</h3>

<p>Hugo is written in Go, Google's alternative programming language. I've been tinkering with Go at work recently, and have been pleasently surprised (other than Generics, but that's another discussion).

<p>The best thing about Hugo though is its fast. Compare the time to generate Rubénerd's 4000+ posts and metadata archives:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Engine</th>
<th>Time</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Jekyll, without tag archives</td>
<td>12:02</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jekyll, with jekyll-archives</td>
<td>42:04</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hugo, with archives</td>
<td>01:20</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Hugo uses TOML, a twist on YAML that looks like a Windows INI file from the 1990s. Fortunately if you're not a fan, you can keep using the same frontmatter
