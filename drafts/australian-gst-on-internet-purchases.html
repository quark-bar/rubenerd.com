<p>The Australian Government have proposed extending the GST onto internet and electronic purchases. To play devil's advocate, why should local retailers be forced to charge GST and increase their prices, when their overseas competitors don't?</p>

<p>Given Australia's geographic isolation, this is a less compelling argument on shipped goods. Local retailers can (and do) charge significantly more, precicely because overseas deliveries have a shipping overhead. In practical terms, it's a form of protectionism.</p>

<p>For digital downloads, its a greyer area. Despite the best efforts of the Coalition, internet speeds are sufficient to stream, download and pay for foreign content that isn't subject to Australian taxation. I'm not a legal expert (surprising nobody), but certainly for physical goods you're liable to pay duty at least. Wouldn't this otherwise cover it?</p>

<p>There's also the issue of enforcement, and the cost thereof. I've read reports dismissing it prohibitively expensive and a net loss. That said, we've also seen reports that the government loses "billions" in revenue without the GST on these goods, assuming the same buying patterns would exist if prices were higher.</p>

<p>(Incidently, this is why I don't buy the arguments about how much piracy costs. It assumes everyone who pirated something would buy the legitimate copy).</p>

<p>I started writing this post resolute in my belief this was a silly idea. Now I'm utterly unsure!</p>
