<p>I’ve made no secret of the fact that I love IT nostalgia. People routinely judge me when I write posts about how to ink out a few more kilobytes of DOS conventional memory, or how Mac OS 8.6 can detect drives using PCI IDE cards. I used to be shy about such stuff, but now I don't care.</p>

<p>It's also become apparent in my small new apartment that if I want to maintain this hobby, I can't have dedicated keyboards, monitors and mouses for all these machines. I have tons of others, but these are the ones regularly used in my new home setup:</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;">(The MacBook Air uses a Belkin Thunderbolt dock, which exports the aforementioned interfaces).</p> 

<p>If only there were a way for these to share a single keyboard, video display and mouse. You'd think someone would have thought of this.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm being facetious. KVMs are not only hypervisors and physical trolleys used in data centres, they're magical little boxes that allow multiple machines to share the same human IO devices. In the case of my desk, I can have a primary display, and flick between them.</p>

<p>But which one to get? Normally, this would be a relatively easy choice, but owing to the disparate hardware over a twenty year period, finding a setup that will allow all of them to work may be tricky.</p>

<p>This is my ideal setup, via some magically wonderful <del>ASCII</del> Unicode art:</p>

<p>For the input devices, this is doable (if messy). USB to Serial should be doable. AT to PS/2 to USB adatpors are available.</p>

<p>The primary issue is the display. My plan was to get a DVI KVM, then use a passive VGA to DVI cable for the three machines that only have VGA. Unfortunately, every DVI KVM I’ve come across only supports the subset DVI-D interface, which doesn't carry a VGA signal. Realistically, this means sticking entirely with DVI or VGA.</p>

<p>KVMs come in VGA or DVI. I figured I'd get a DVI one,
