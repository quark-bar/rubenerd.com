<p>There's a fascinating thread on Slashdot about what you'd include in your Frankenstein OS, assuming such a feat were possible. Below is mine.</p>

<dl>
<dt style="font-weight:bold">NetBSD kernel</dt>
<dd>I'm a FreeBSD guy in daily use for pragmatic reasons, but NetBSD is achingly beautiful. Provided I could get drivers.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">OpenBSD firewall</dt>
<dd>pf is the only firewall that doesn't make me want to remove hair.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Mac OS X font rendering</dt>
<dd>Windows fonts aren't great, and the average Linux desktop is awful.<p></p></dt>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Homebrew package manager</dt>
<dd>Keeping applications in their own trees is clean, easier to maintain and helps mitigate dependency hell.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">BeOS desktop environment</dt>
<dd>It had elements of classic Mac OS, but it was even cleaner and simpler.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Windows 3.0 or 3.1 iconset</dt>
<dd>For the nostalgic feels.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">OS/2 WarpCenter</dt>
<dd>Quick, simple glance at system status and application launching.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Yokogawa parallelism</dt>
<dd>If a CPU fails, I want to be able to pull it out and replace, live, and without skipping a beat.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Solaris ZFS</dt>
<dd>All other file systems are brittle and scary.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Vim keybindings</dt>
<dd>Everywhere. You can use a mouse and standard shortcuts, but still use Vim regex, navigation and visual editing in all the places.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Windows DirectX</dt>
<dd>I support OpenGL in principle, but I'd love to be able to play classic games without a compatibility layer. WINE is capable otherwise.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Perl shell with DOS or CP/M mode</dt>
<dd>Compatible with Bourne shell syntax (get those Bashims away from me), can run DOS and CP/M binaries unmodified, and accept DOS syntax when typed by accident (I grew up using it and still type cls constantly).<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">PalmOS mobile interface</dt>
<dd>For the mobile version of the OS. Still the gold standard in mobile UIs that no other platform has beat.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Complete ncurses interface</dt>
<dd>Based on Norton Commander, XTree Gold or whatever. Anything that can be done in the GUI and with text commands should have an nucures interface for easy, lightweight, remote use.</dd> 

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Built in Go</dt>
<dd>It's my flavour of the month, but other type safe languages would suffice.</dd>
