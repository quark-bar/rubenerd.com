<p>I wasn't alive during the Appollo missions, or when Gallileo first proposed the Earth revolved around the sun. The former could be possible, the latter would involve either immortality or a time machine.</p>

<p>But this month, we're all priveliged beyond belief to finally be the first humans to view Pluto in this detail.</p>

<p>In the entire history of our species, the most we've ever seen of this elusive celestial body is a shadow, or a scant few pixelsbarely covering the full stop at the end of this sentence. Equally, we now have images of Charon, Pluto's moon that so large their centre of gravity lies between them.</p>

<p>One day, our decendents may be walking on that surface, either through terraforming (somehow) or donning space suits. Either way, I'm excited for them.</p>

<p>Science is beautiful.</p>
