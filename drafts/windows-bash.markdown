<p style="font-style:italic">This post was originally written (then promptly forgotten), on the 6th of April 2016. It was about something surprisingly interesting (for once), so decided to publish despite its abject lack of timeliness.</p>

Scott Hanselman reported this [rather surprising news]:

> Of course, I didn't always find the prompts that worked like I did. But today at BUILD in the Day One keynote Kevin Gallo announced that you can now run "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows." This is a new developer feature included in a Windows 10 "Anniversary" update (coming soon). It lets you run native user-mode Linux shells and command-line tools unchanged, on Windows. 

I haven't been a full-time Windows user for a decade now, but its still surprising news. Given its proximity to April Fools, I didn't even believe it at first. No more cygwin for a ton of stuff! Think of the automation one could do now.

As a BSD guy, now all we need is the FreeBSD userland on there for something closer resembling POSIX compliance. Or even just an Almquist shell in lieu of bash for portability. I'm only being half tongue in cheek.
