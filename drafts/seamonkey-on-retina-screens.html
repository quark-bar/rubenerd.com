title: "Seamonkey on retina screens"
---

<p>I've had a Retina MacBook Pro for half a year now. Dangerously, the quality of the screen has gone from dazzling to normal; non-retina screens look awful now.</p>

<p>Most applications take advantage of the screen just fine, though there are a few holdouts. The latest versions of SeaMonkey still render their entire XUL interface at half the resolutuon, which results in jarringly bad text. 

<p>Open /Applications/SeaMonkey.app/Contents/Info.plist, and update the last lines to reflect this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;key&gt;NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;true/&gt;
&lt;key&gt;NSPrincipalClass&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;GeckoNSApplication&lt;/string&gt;
</pre>

<p>UI elements will still be pixelated, but at least text is legible again.</p>
