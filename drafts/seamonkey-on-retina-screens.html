<p>I've had a Retina MacBook Pro for half a year now. Dangerously, the quality of the screen has gone from dazzling to normal; non-retina screens look awful now.</p>

<p>Most applications take advantage of the screen just fine, though there are a few holdouts. The latest versions of SeaMonkey still render their entire XUL interface at half the resolutuon, which results in jarringly bad text. 

<p>Open /Applications/SeaMonkey.app/Contents/Info.plist</p>

234         <key>NSSupportsAutomaticGraphicsSwitching</key>
235         <true/>
236         <key>NSPrincipalClass</key>
237         <string>GeckoNSApplication</string>
