<p>The Ruby world has RVM and, more recently, rbenv as version management tools. You install them to an isolated directory, then build Ruby and all the depencendies you reqire. They’re useful for testing and deployments, as you’re not limited to the system’s gemset library or package managers.</p> 

<p>Today after getting into some dependency mess with Homebrew, I took a look at a Perl equivilent in Perlbrew. Like the aforementioned tools, its a clean way to maintain self-contained Perl installs. It's great!</p>

<p>The default installer places into ~/perl5, but I prefer personal stuff going in /opt. Homebrew has trained me to avoid sudo when I can, so I create the directory first:</p>

<pre>
$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/perl5
$ sudo rubenerd:staff /opt/perl5
</pre>

<p>And define that we want it going there:</p>

<pre>
$ export PERLBREW_ROOT=/opt/perl5
</pre>

<p>Now we can pull the installer and run it.</p>

<pre>
$ curl -kL http://install.perlbrew.pl | sh
</pre>
