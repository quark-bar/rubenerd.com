An astute observation linking this to youth unemployment. I grew up in Singapore, where even ten years ago you couldn't get far without a bachelors, and a masters only got you a foot in the door.

As these degrees here become de facto compulsory, it's even more citrical we have accessible and affordable education, particularly given people my age won't be retiring until we're 200 years old or something.

(And not to forget Labor's plan to defund unis for Gonski).
