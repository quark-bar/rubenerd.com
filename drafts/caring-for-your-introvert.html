<p>This <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/03/caring-for-your-introvert/302696/">2003 article by Jonathan Rauch</a> remains one of my favourites on the topic of introversion. I'd quote the whole thing, but these sections are the ones that made me leap out of my chair and scream YES.

<blockquote>
<p>"It is very difficult for an extrovert to understand an introvert," write the education experts Jill D. Burruss and Lisa Kaenzig. [..]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was a source of much ridicule in high school, etc. Now, I don't care :).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Extroverts have little or no grasp of introversion. They assume that company, especially their own, is always welcome. They cannot imagine why someone would need to be alone; indeed, they often take umbrage at the suggestion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ditto. Needing to be alone is always interpreted as something <em>against</em> someone, and explaining is almost always fruitless. It could be for this reason, among others:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Science has learned a good deal in recent years about the habits and requirements of introverts. It has even learned, by means of brain scans, that introverts process information differently from other people (I am not making this up).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Citation needed, but a fascinating idea if true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Extroverts are energized by people, and wilt or fade when alone. They often seem bored by themselves, in both senses of the expression. [..] In contrast, after an hour or two of being socially "on," we introverts need to turn off and recharge. My own formula is roughly two hours alone for every hour of socializing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think I can get by with an hour alone for each hour socialising (work, family, friends), whether that's walking around or staying at home. But that hasn't been possible since I was a teenager.</p>
