<p>Long time readers know I've been a heavy user of The Gimp (despite the horrid name). I initially moved to it in 2006, back when I got my first Intel Mac and Macromedia Fireworks didn't have a Universal Binary yet. I forced myself to use it, and hated it for ages, but now I can use it just fine.</p>

<p>I've since moved on to Photoshop, for two reasons. 1) Introduction to Photography at UTS showed me how to use it properly. And B), Adobe's Creative Cloud subscription bundles it with Lightroom for two cups of coffee a month.</p>

<p>Perhaps if Illustrator were more approachable in cost and time, I'd use that. But I still use Inkscape.:wq


<p>Arguably though, Inkscape is far more intuitive than The Gimp. 

Taking photography at UTS, I've started learning
