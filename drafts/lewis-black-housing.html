But, nobody said anything. They said nothing. All we heard, in the
United States, was this. It went on every day. There's nothing more
wonderful than the economic system known as capitalism. It is the
most splendid garden there is. It was created in the mind of God
himself, and that's why its perfect. It's so perfect, that it has
its own sunlight, and it irrigates itself. It's an absolute
miracle, capitalism. And if it goes completed unregulated, that
garden will grow, and grow, and grow, until all the people's of the
earth will share in its fruit. And so I went to bed every night,d
reaming of my fruit. And then I woke up one morning, and there was
the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, going... WE'RE
FUCKED. And I thought, what could have possibly happened... last
night? Was he sitting up one night finishing his online math
course? In the US, they actually blame people who said they
couldn't afford rent, and yet... those people bought houses.
Fuckers! It's their fault! No its not. You can't blame those
people. Because there isn't anyone, in their right mind, if you
were completely broke, and someone came up to you and said "I know
you can't afford to pay rent... want a house?" What are you going
to say? I'm going ti keep living in my box? It's greed that caused
all of this. Put it simply.
