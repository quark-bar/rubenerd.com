<p>I've had this Lewis Black quote in my drafts folder for ages. I don't remember which standup routine this was from, but its gold. Sharing.

<blockquote>
<p>But, nobody said anything. They said nothing. All we heard, in the United States, was this. It went on every day.</p>

<p>There's nothing more wonderful than the economic system known as capitalism. It is the most splendid garden there is. It was created in the mind of God himself, and that's why it's perfect. It's so perfect, that it has its own sunlight, and it irrigates itself. It's an absolute miracle, capitalism. And if it goes completed unregulated, that garden will grow, and grow, and grow, until all the people's of the earth will share in its fruit (smiles).</p>

<p>And so I went to bed every night, dreaming of my fruit.</p>

<p>And then I woke up one morning, and there was the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, going... WE'RE FUCKED. WE'RE TOTALLY FUCKED.</p>

<p>And I thought, what could have possibly happened... last night? Was he sitting up one night finishing his online math course? In the US, they actually blame people who said they couldn't afford rent, and yet... those people bought houses.Fuckers! It's their fault! No its not. You can't blame thosepeople. Because there isn't anyone, in their right mind, if youwere completely broke, and someone came up to you and said "I knowyou can't afford to pay rent... want a house?" What are you goingto say? I'm going ti keep living in my box? It's greed that causedall of this. Put it simply.</body></html>
