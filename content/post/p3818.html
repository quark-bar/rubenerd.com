<p>Taken on my iPhone in December at the Starbucks outside Pacific Plaza on Scotts Rd (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;source=s_q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=pacific+plaza+singapore&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=43.664131,59.589844&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=1.30652,103.831133&#038;spn=0.006757,0.007274&#038;t=h&#038;z=17&#038;iwloc=A">Google Maps</a>), just a block away from Orchard. Beautiful weather.</p>
<p>Come to think of itâ€™s beautiful weather right now too. Might go for a walk.</p>
