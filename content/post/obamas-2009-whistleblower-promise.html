<p>Below for your perusel, have this <a href="http://change.gov/agenda/ethics_agenda/">2009 Obama election promise</a>. It has to be read in full to really be appreciated.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://change.gov/agenda/ethics_agenda/"><p><strong>Protect Whistleblowers</strong>: Often the best source of information about waste, fraud, and abuse in government is an existing government employee committed to public integrity and willing to speak out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No kidding.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://change.gov/agenda/ethics_agenda/"><p>Such acts of courage and patriotism, which can sometimes save lives and often save taxpayer dollars, should be encouraged rather than stifled. We need to empower federal employees as watchdogs of wrongdoing and partners in performance. Barack Obama will strengthen whistleblower laws to protect federal workers who expose waste, fraud, and abuse of authority in government. Obama will ensure that federal agencies expedite the process for reviewing whistleblower claims and whistleblowers have full access to courts and due process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I remember when I thought Obama was cool.</p>
