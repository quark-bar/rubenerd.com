<p>This Lateline feature on Australia's housing affordability hit the preverbial nails on the head. The ABC originally aired it on the 23rd of April.</p>

<p>It also gives me a chance to try HTML5's video element. If you can't see the video, have a <a href="http://mpegmedia.abc.net.au/news/lateline/video/201504/LATs_HousingPitch_2304_512k.mp4">direct link</a> and the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/vodcast.htm">source page</a>.</p>
