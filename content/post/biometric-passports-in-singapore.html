<p>I studied in Singapore most of my schooling years so whenever I see an article about Singapore in international news sites etc, I have to read it.</p>
<p>In this case according to <a href="http://news.com.com/Singapore+unveils+biometric+passport/2100-1029_3-6056746.html?tag=nefd.top">C|Net News.com</a> Singapore is unveiling &quot;biometric passports&quot;.</p>
<blockquote><p>
From August, all passport holders in Singapore can apply for new travel documents with additional security features designed for international standards.</p>
<p>The biometric passport, called BioPass, was unveiled Friday by the government. Each e-passport contains a polycarbonate page that is embedded with a contactless chip, carrying the owner’s facial and fingerprint biometric identifiers.</p>
<p>Singapore, along with Australia, New Zealand and the United States, has been involved in an International Live Test since January. These trials are expected to be completed by April 15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cynical people might roll their eyes and say this is the next step to Big Brother, but personally anything I see that can help stamp out (no pun intended… passports…) identity theft is a good thing.</p>
<p>I guess my concern is if/when in the future they&#39;ll have GPS RFID tags embedded in passports so governments can track your every move. THAT would be scary.</p>
