<p>I got quite the surprise on CentOS 7 today. While attempting to move a file (let's call it file x), I got the strangest error.</p>

<pre>
$ mv /sbin/x /usr/sbin/x
==&gt; mv: cannot move ‘x/’ to a subdirectory of itself.
</pre>

<p>Wait, what? Did I type that right?</p>

<p>Not to get all Malcolm Gladwell on you (again), but <em>turns out</em>, CentOS 7 introdues this file system structure.</p>

<pre>
$ ls -l /
==&gt; bin -&gt; usr/bin
==&gt; lib -&gt; usr/lib
==&gt; lib64 -&gt; usr/lib64
==&gt; sbin -&gt; usr/bin
</pre>

<p>That's right, <code>/{s}bin</code> and <code>/lib{64}</code> are symlinked to their respective <code>/usr</code>.</p>

<p>Huh!</p>

<p>As a <a href="http://rubenerd.com/freebsd-boleh/">BSD user first</a> (here we go), it took me <strong><em>this long</em></strong> to feel okay having Linux mix userland and system utitilies. Now, we're further collapsing these directories into one place. I'd be interested to hear their justification; on the surface it seems short sighted.</p>

<p>By comparison, BSD documents clear separations between these. FreeBSD's hier(7) manpage defines them as:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>/bin</strong>: 
user utilities fundamental to both single-user and multi-user environments</p>
<p><strong>/usr/bin</strong>:
common utilities, programming tools, and applications</p>
<p><strong>/usr/local</strong>:
local executables, libraries, etc. Also used as the default destination for the FreeBSD ports framework.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Granted, the distinction between system and package manager maintained assets is moot on Linux distros, as they're all updated from apt-get, yum and so on. Whether this is a good idea or not is beyond the scope of this post.</p>

<p>But still, it's interesting these distinctions are no longer deemed relevent to CentOS (or perhaps <del>Prominent North American Enterprise Linux vendor</del> Red Hat). Mixing bash with your gcc? Sure, you're tangling all your stuff with systemd anyway.</p>
