<p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/06/microsoft-has-a-new-mission-statement-and-its-basically-the-same-as-its-old-one/">Ars Technica has an article</a> about Microsoft's revised mission statement. Its marketing buzzwords and uninspiring verbosity lead the article's author to opine:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Both are a far cry from the Bill Gates era. "A computer on every desk and in every home" was clearer in intent and actually measurable; it was a mission statement that allowed Microsoft to more or less say "Mission accomplished."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not even frustrated by this any more, I'm just curious why nobody ever quotes the second part of that statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[..] running Microsoft software.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's like the journalists of the world have collective amnesia. I'd argue it significantly changes the tone of any article that quotes it.</p>
