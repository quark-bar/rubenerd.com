<p>I’ve noticed a reoccurring theme of posts on the <a href="http://j-walkblog.com/"> J-Walk Blog</a> wherein either John Walkenbach (or his stunt double) searches his <a href="http://j-walkblog.com/index.php?/weblog/C15/">music</a> library for song titles based on the presence of a particular word. Given what today is, I figure it’s only fitting I do something just as fun and utterly unproductive myself.</p>
<p>For example, here is a list of songs from my music library on my MacBook Pro that contain the following words. Granted I only have a few gigs on music on here compared to my desktop back in Singapore, but it’s a start.</p>
<h3>Shampoo</h3>
<ol>
<li>In Search of the Perfect Shampoo &#8212; <em>Michael Franks</em>, Burchfield Nines</li>
</ol>
<h3>Eggplant</h3>
<ol>
<li>Eggplant &#8212; <em>Michael Franks</em>, The Art of Tea</li>
</ol>
<h3>Toyko</h3>
<ol>
<li>Rainy Night in Tokyo &#8212; <em>Michael Franks</em>, Tiger in the Rain</li>
</ol>
<h3>Dragonfly</h3>
<ol>
<li>Dragonfly Summer &#8212; <em>Michael Franks</em>, title song</li>
</ol>
<p>With all this talk about words in songs though, we mustn’t forget that <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Trashmen/_/Surfin%27+Bird">The Bird is the Word</a>. The bird bird bird. The bird is the word. Papa-oom-mow-mow-mow. Papa-oom-mow-mow-mow. Don’t you know about the bird? Everybody knows that the bird is the word!</p>
<p>Now if you’d excuse me, I’m off to find my way out of Sanpaku while in Search of the Perfect Shampoo. Here’s hoping I don’t get Popsicle Toes along the way.</p>
