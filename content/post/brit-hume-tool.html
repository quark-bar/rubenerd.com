<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpSi9Bqufq4" title="" >Jaw, meet floor</a>. To be fair to Fox News, at least they had one dissenting panelist who scoffed at the idea that oil was just in a <em>&quot;few isolated patches&quot;</em>, and that nature could take care of it. Frankly, the moment Brit asked <em>&quot;Where&#39;s the oil?&quot;</em> I would have informed him it&#39;s in his skull, where his brain should be.</p>
<p>I post this because Singapore is <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1059580/1/.html">dealing with its own oil spill</a> now too. Obviously its an order of magnitude smaller than what BP managed to do in the US, but given Singapore is barely the size of a country town in land area the effects are being felt all over the place. The smell, mostly :P.</p>
