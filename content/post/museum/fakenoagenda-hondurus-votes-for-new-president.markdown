[From DW](http://www.dw.de/hondurans-vote-for-president-as-country-struggles-with-violence-and-poverty/a-17249121?maca=en-TWITTER-EN-2004-xml-mrss):

> Sunday's vote pits the leftist wife of Honduras' deposed president, Xiomara Castro, against the head of Congress, Juan Orlando Hernandez, of the ruling conservative National Party. Polls put the two candidates in a statistical tie heading into the election, though Castro is regarded as the slight favorite ahead of Hernandez.

A leftist... called Castro? Only your [Fake] No Agenda could have uncovered this obvious connection.
