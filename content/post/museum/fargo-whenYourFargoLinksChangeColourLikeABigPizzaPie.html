<p style="font-style:italic">This post originally appeared on my <a rel="nofollow" title="When your Fargo links change colour, like a big pizza pie…" href="http://ruben.smallpict.com/2013/07/11/whenYourFargoLinksChangeColourLikeABigPizzaPie">Fargo blog</a>, which Dave sunsetted in 2016. It’s <a title="View all posts in the museum" href="https://rubenerd.com/museum/">preserved here</a> here for posterity.</p>

<p>That would have been infinitely funnier if it rhymed. Sorry Dino.</p>

<p>But I digress. Turns out I misunderstood the CSS tab in the Settings window of Fargo. Changes there are reflected in Fargo itself, NOT in the public reader which you see now.</p>

<p>Guess it’s back to the drawing board!</p>
