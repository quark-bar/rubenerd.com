[Jason Easly, quoting Sarah Palin](http://www.politicususa.com/2013/11/24/sarah-palin-humiliates-fox-news-knowing-nuclear-option.html) and her baffling response to a question about the nuclear option:

> As for this rule change that some people are calling the nucular option under Senate rules, you know, I guarantee this week, Thanksgiving dinner, people sitting around their tables, we’re not going to be talking about the president blessing this thwarting of the balance of power in Congress with new Senate rules called the nucular [sic] option.

I agree with Adam and John, there's no reason why people should be poking fun at Sarah Palin. She's an erudite, intelligent person who probably even knows what erudite means.
