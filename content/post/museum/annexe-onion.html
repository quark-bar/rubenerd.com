<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick tip if you need to cut some onions&hellip; don&rsquo;t! Put them whole into your food processor and pulse on and off for fifteen seconds. DONE! Saved a ton of effort, the pieces are very uniform, and I didn&rsquo;t cut myself or get juice in my eyes!</p>

<p>Why didn&rsquo;t we think of this before?!</p>
