<p style="font-style:italic">This post originally appeared on the <a rel="nofollow" title="When VMware split my profile" href="http://ruben.smallpict.com/2013/07/10/whenVmwareSplitMyProfile">Annexe</a>, when it was hosted on Fargo.</p> 

<p>For some reason my account has morphed into two:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://communities.vmware.com/people/rubenerd/">My profile</a></li>
<li><a href="http://communities.vmware.com/people/RubenSchade/">My&#8230; other profile?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This happened after buying VMware Fusion 5.0 Professional. My licences are in one, my (albeit sparse) community posts are in the other. Logging in, I get taken to the second one. I have no idea how to log into the first one.</p>

<p>Me thinks a long and complex road paved with support tickets is about to be travelled. Wish me luck.</p>
