<p>My third, and most current, tattoo, on my left shoulder. I wanted to get something with a gryphon in it and was pondering something like a family crest. We were already going to the tattoo shop for my nephew to get his first and my wife had one she wanted to get.</p>
<p>Well, this beauty was taped to the artist’s wall, ready to be inked on someone, but he said he didn’t have any takers. I’m a fan of Family Guy and love the “Bird is the Word” episode, and it had a gryphon in it, so I went for it. </p>
