As if we haven't heard enough about failing Boeing 787s with exploding batteries, [we have this news](http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/23/us-airlines-boeing-idUSBRE9AM03G20131123?feedType=RSS&feedName=businessNews):

> (Reuters) - Boeing advised airlines on Friday about a risk of engine icing problems on its new 747-8 and 787 Dreamliner planes with engines made by General Electric, urging 15 carriers to avoid flying them near high-level thunderstorms.

Obviously a ploy by climate alarmists to prove climate change is affecting weather.

Airbus operatives also continue to undermine the 787, to advance sales of their composite-constructed A350. I think Fokker are involved too, because of Dutch socialism.
