Post install from MacPorts:

    Before starting lighttpd it must be configured. Lighttpd 
    is configured by editing 
    /opt/local/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf. Thereâ€™s a sample 
    config file at 
    /opt/local/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf.default. Please 
    note that the launchd daemon relies on the PID being at 
    /opt/local/var/run/lighttpd.pid.
