<p style="font-style:italic">This post originally appeared on my <a rel="nofollow" title="Streaming fake coffee shop noise" href="http://ruben.smallpict.com/2013/07/10/streamingFakeCoffeeShopNoise">Fargo blog</a>, which Dave sunsetted in 2016. It’s <a title="View all posts in the museum" href="https://rubenerd.com/museum/">preserved here</a> here for posterity.</p>

<p>By <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/technology/2013/07/streaming-fake-ambient-coffee-shop-noise-big-seoul/6131/">Bonnie Tsui at The Atlantic Cities</a>, one of my favourite blogs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Recent brain research has shown that the moderate ambient noise of café chatter and espresso machines, in the range of about about 70 decibels, fosters creative work in a way that extreme quiet (50 decibels or less; think library quiet) does not.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can attest to this. No matter what I do to furnish my SOHO, I do my most creative work (code, blogging, pontificating) at coffee shops. I’d long assumed there was more to it than the simple caffeine hit I was gladly receiving.</p>

<p>So what’s the solution for those who can’t leave the house, such as ankle-busted people like me?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So perhaps it’s no surprise that a new website, Coffitivity, is offering to let you stream the creativity-boosting buzz of the local coffee shop right into your home or office.</p>
