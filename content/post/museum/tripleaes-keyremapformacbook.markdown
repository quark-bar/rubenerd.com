*This originally appeared in my side-blog TripleAESâš‚.*

Mavericks does not persistently store the key mappings on my Model M clone. It's infuriating, and had me pondering a Mountain Lion downgrade.

Through some forum searching, I came across [KeyRemap4MacBook]. It's bewildering with its numerous duplicated options shoehorned into one window, but my Windows and Alt keys are now mapped to Option and Command.
