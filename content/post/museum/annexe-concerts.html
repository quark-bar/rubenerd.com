<blockquote>
<p><strong>Concerts</strong></p>
<ul><li>You get crushed to the point you think you’re going to die.</li>
<li>You struggle breathing in between thousands of people.</li>
<li>You queue for hours on end to get near the front.</li>
<li>You travel ridiculous distances to see your favourite bands.</li>
<li>You sweat and look like a complete mess.</li>
<li>You’re being pushed around by strangers.</li>
<li>You’re feet kill from being stomped on and jumping around.</li>
<li>You have no voice the day after from singing/screaming so loud.</li>
</ul><p>But none of this matters, because you’re having the time of your life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously never been to a JAZZ concert ;)</p>
