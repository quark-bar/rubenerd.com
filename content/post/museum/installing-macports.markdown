Post install text:

    Congratulations, you have successfully installed the 
    MacPorts system. To get the Portfiles and update the 
    system, run:
    
    sudo port selfupdate

    Please read port(1) and the MacPorts Wiki at 
    http://trac.macports.org/ for full documentation.

    Stray sources might have been left in the legacy 
    /opt/local/var/db/dports directory after this upgrade,
    which moved most of what it could to 
    /opt/local/var/macports, so you might want to look in 
    the former and cleanup manually.
