<p style="font-style:italic">This post originally appeared on my <a rel="nofollow" title="Have a list of classy 80s songs I like" href="http://ruben.smallpict.com/2013/07/10/haveAListOfClassy80sSongsILike">Fargo blog</a>, which Dave sunsetted in 2016. It’s <a title="View all posts in the museum" href="https://rubenerd.com/museum/">preserved here</a> here for posterity.</p>

<p>In no particular order, to test lists in Fargo:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Bette Davis Eyes</em>, Kim Carnes</li>
<li><em>True</em>, Spandau Ballet</li>
<li><em>Lily Was Here</em>, David A. Stewart</li>
<li><em>Avalon</em>, Roxy Music</li>
<li><em>Jealous Guy</em>, Bryan Ferry (I know, I know; I like his cover)</li>
<li><em>Baker Street</em>, Gerry Rafferty</li>
</ul>

<p>The irony hasn’t been lost on me that these songs were recorded either before I was born, or when I was an infant.</p>
