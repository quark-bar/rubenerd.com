<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>âœˆ Credit Card Payments are Now Convenient, Fast and Secure</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This email has been sent to: [redacted]. All future FedEx email communications will be sent to this address. You can unsubscribe or update your email preferences at any time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FedEx eNews Center<br/>
  We hate to see you go.<br/>
  If you would like to change the types of emails you receive from FedEx, simply change your preferences below. Or, you can unsubscribe from all FedEx promotional mailing lists.
  { Unsubscribe from Australia emails }</p>

<p><strong>FAIL.</strong></p>

<ul><li>Should not need to confirm.</li>
</ul>
