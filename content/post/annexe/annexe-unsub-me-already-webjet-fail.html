<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3 Days Only: 50% OFF Tigerair domestic flights</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Privacy Policy | Contact Us | Update my location | Unsubscribe</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Manage your newsletter subscription details<br/>
  Please confirm your details and subscription settings below.<br/>
  [ Email Address ]<br/>
  [ Name ]<br/>
  [ State ]<br/>
  [ Date of Birth ]<br/>
  [ x ] Subscribe [ ] Unsubscribe from Travel Newsletters<br/>
  [ x ] Subscribe [ ] Unsubscribe from Business and First Class<br/>
  [ x ] Subscribe [ ] Unsubscribe from Crusies</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong><em>FAIL.</em></strong></p>

<ul><li>Should not need to enter email address</li>
<li>Should not need to confirm</li>
<li>Defaulting to &ldquo;subscribed&rdquo; is egregious</li>
<li>Should not need to check multiple radio buttons</li>
</ul>
