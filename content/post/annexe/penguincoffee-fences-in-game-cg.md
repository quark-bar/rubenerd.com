Given I have an imouto iRL, the whole incest angle means I could never watch Oreimo (shudders)! I suppose if the lead guy ends up with Aragaki Ayase it'd be okay, if only because in the PSP game she seems to wear a sukumizu #shot.

What gets me about this game CG is the gap in the fence for her face. I'd rather there not be a fence at all, but I suppose if you're going to have one...! What's that called when glasses (etc) are partially hidden to show a character's eyes?
