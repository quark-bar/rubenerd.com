The [No Agenda](http://noagendashow.com) show is a long running podcast by Adam Curry and John C. Dvorak. Rather than be influenced by advertisers, their conjecture is dictated by their donors, dubbed producers.

This blog is an unofficial companion to this fine podcast and the [No Agenda News Network](http://noagendanewsnetwork.com). 

The header image is of *Enoshima Junko* from Danganronpa, drawn by [zy2386262 on Pixiv](http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&illust_id=39686291). Because guns mean freedom, and she has killer legs. Speaking as a "TV executive" of course, which excuses us from everything!
