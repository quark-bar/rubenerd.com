<p>In most multi-party parliamentary systems, the prime minister has much less power than the president in a system like in the US. (no veto!) On top of that, the prime minister can only pick from elected officials to create his cabinet, not his Yale friends and business buddies, making them far more accountable.</p>

<p>Also, that one party with 33% doesn&rsquo;t hold all the power, the entire parliament holds the power. Yes, the party that creates the cabinet has more opportunity to introduce bills, but it takes a majority vote of parliament to pass them.</p>

<p>Lastly, Australia uses &ldquo;Preference Voting&rdquo;. To translate that to real US terms: you can safely vote for Nader without by doing do increasing the Repugnicans&rsquo; chances to win the election.</p>
