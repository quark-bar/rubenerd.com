<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Updates to GitHub Terms of Service</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Email preferences · Terms · Privacy · Sign into GitHub</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Email preferences<br/>
  [ ] Receive all emails, except those I unsubscribe from.<br/>
  [ ] Only receive account related emails, and those I subscribe to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>FAIL.</strong></p>

<ul><li>Footer didn&rsquo;t include &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo;, so email filter couldn&rsquo;t catch</li>
<li>Should not need to log in to unsubscribe</li>
<li>Can&rsquo;t unsubscribe from everything, so need to add to my delete filters</li>
</ul>
