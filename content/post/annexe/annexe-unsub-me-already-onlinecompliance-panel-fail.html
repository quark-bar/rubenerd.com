<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Change Well: Change Management in Human Resources</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you do not wish to receive emails from OnlineCompliancePanel Please Unsubscribe or reply to this email with &ldquo;Unsubscribe Me&rdquo; as subject line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are you sure you want your email address<br/>
  [ADDRESS]<br/>
  to be removed from our distribution list?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result, after confirmation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your email address<br/>
  [ADDRESS]<br/>
  has been removed from our distribution list.
  We are sorry for any inconvenience we may have caused you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>FAIL.</strong></p>

<ul><li>Should not need to confirm with another email</li>
</ul>
