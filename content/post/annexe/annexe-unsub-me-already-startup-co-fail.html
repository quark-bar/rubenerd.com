<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Free eBook: Entrepreneurs Share Lessons Learned</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You received this email because you are subscribed to emails from Startups.co. Update your email preferences to choose the types of emails you receive. Unsubscribe from all future emails</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Startups.co<br/>
  Communication Preferences
  If this is not your email address, please ignore this page since the email associated with this page was most likely forwarded to you.
  [Unsubscribe me from all mailing lists.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>FAIL.</strong></p>

<ul><li>Should not need to confirm</li>
</ul>
