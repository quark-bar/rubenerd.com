<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Succeeding in Leadership</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unsubscribe<br/><br/>
  We have recently experienced some minor technical issues with our unsubscribe function. If you unsubscribed between June 4th and 7th we may not have received your unsubscribe request and so may have been unable to unsubscribe you. Please accept our sincere apologies for this. The unsubscribe function is now operational again, to unsubscribe please click the above unsubscribe link.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are sorry to see you go.<br/>
  We will process your request within 3 business days.<br/>
  [ Email Field ]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>FAIL.</strong></p>

<ul><li>Should not need to confirm</li>
</ul>
