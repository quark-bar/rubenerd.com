<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does your Internet development project need a boost?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You have received this email because you are an APNIC contact. Unsubscribe from subsequent APNIC emails about ISIF Asia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Email Preference Centre<br/>
  Select which lists you would like to receive email communications from.<br/>
  [x] ISIF Asia Grants and Award 2017</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After clicking &ldquo;Opt out&rdquo;:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are you sure you want to opt out from all further email communications?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>FAIL</strong></p>

<ul><li>Should not need to confirm email address</li>
<li>Should not need to confirm the (one) mailing list</li>
<li>Should not need to confirm a confirmation</li>
</ul>
