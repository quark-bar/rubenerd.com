<p>&ldquo;It is also true that our intuitions have been known to fail. Indeed, many of the deliverances of reason don&rsquo;t seem to be reasonable at first glance. When asked how thick a piece of newspaper would be if one could fold it upon itself one hundred times in succession, most of us imagine something about the size of a brick. A little arithmetic reveals, however, that such an object would be as thick as the known universe. If we&rsquo;ve learned anything in the last two thousand years, it is that a person&rsquo;s sense of what is reasonable sometimes needs a little help finding its feet.</p>
