<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Too many businesses take print security for granted</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>HP respects your privacy. HP uses automatic data collection tools to personalize your experience. If you&rsquo;d like to discontinue receiving e-mails from HP regarding special offers and information, please click here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To unsubscribe, please check the appropriate box(es). To keep your subscription(s) active, simply close this window.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>FAIL.</strong></p>

<ul><li>Footer didn&rsquo;t include &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo;, so email filter couldn&rsquo;t catch</li>
<li>Should not need to check checkboxes</li>
<li>Should not need to check <em>multiple</em> checkboxes</li>
</ul>
