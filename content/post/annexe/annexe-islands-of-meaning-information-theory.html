<img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/museum/tumblr_loswphGe6X1qz6f9yo1_1280.jpg" alt="Claude Shannon, father of information theory, separated information from meaning. His central dogma, 'meaning is irrelevant' declared that information could be handled as a mathematical abstraction independent of meaning. The consequence of this freedom is the flood of information in which we are drowning. The immense size of modern databases gives a feeling of meaninglessness...It is our task as humans to bring meaning back into this wasteland. As finite creatures who think and feel, we can create islands of meaning in the sea of information" />
