[Peter S. Goodman in the New York Times]\:

> That Britain is even contemplating an exit speaks to the ferment shaping politics in much of the world, as people grapple with the effects of globalization, automation and immigration â€” forces that present opportunities and pressures alike, changing the look and feel of communities. With the vote, Britain is determining its place in the world. Yet an argument over British identity is masquerading as an economic debate.
