<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Global Millennial 20/20 Summit is Heading to Sydney! Super early bird prices available</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Want to change how you receive these emails? You can update your preferences or unsubscribe from this list</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unsubscribe Successful<br/>
  You will no longer receive email marketing from this list.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>PASS!</strong></p>

<p>It also had one of those obnoxious &ldquo;let us know why you unsubscribed&rdquo; questions, but that wasn&rsquo;t mandatory to unsubscribe.</p>
