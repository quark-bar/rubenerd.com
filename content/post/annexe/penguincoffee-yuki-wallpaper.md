You may have a feel for the owners of this account now &ndash; so for my own wallpaper.

I haven't changed my wallpaper since I set it after Ruben helped me reinstall Mac OS X from scratch on a brand new SSD. He says Yuki reminds him of me, but for me, Yuki reminds me of him. I could only wish to be half as epic as a character such as her though~
