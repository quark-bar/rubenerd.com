<p style="font-style:italic">This post originally appeared on the <a rel="nofollow" title="Some initial observations about Fargo" href="http://ruben.smallpict.com/2013/07/04/someInitialObservationsAboutFargo">Annexe</a>, when it was hosted on Fargo.</p> 

<p>(A big thanks to everyone in the Fargo community for their comments. If I had a Disqus account, I’d thank you! I’ll try out your suggestions. ☺)</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, no way to disable Disqus comments. For reasons I won’t get into here, I prefer not to use them.</p>

<p>My custom CSS doesn’t seem to be coming through.</p>

<p>No spell checking. I make so many typos this is bound to be an issue.</p>

<p>Each panel in the Settings window has to be updated seperately. If I change something in &#8220;Font&#8221; then click &#8220;Advanced&#8221; without clicking OK first, my changes are deleted.</p>

<p>The Fargo outline editor doesn’t respect the [Shift]-[Down] combination to select an entire line, like most contemporary editors.</p>

<p>It’s US centric, or at least the timestamps are. I’m in Sydney, Australia, and these dates are wildly wrong. Wonder if there’s a way to define a +1000 timezone?</p>

<p>The title for my blog here seems to have vanished.</p>

<p>Those issues aside, usability wise I’m liking this a lot. I’m not going to give up my primary self-hosted blog, but this could be used for any number of side projects I’m working on. And I’ve always had a thing for outlines.</p>

<p>Being able to hit [Command]-[R] and [Command]-[L] to indent or move out an outline point is nice.</p>

<p>+1 for RSS 2.0 (It’s Dave, so what would you expect?). The less I have to deal with Atom, the better.</p>
