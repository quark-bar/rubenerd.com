<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TechTarget: Welcome. We think you should read these 5 articles next.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To unsubscribe from TechTarget emails, go to [keysmash]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[ ] Unsubscribe me from all TechTarget e-mails. If you no longer wish to receive e-mails from TechTarget&rsquo;s network of sites, please select this box.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>FAIL.</strong></p>

<ul><li>Should not need to check a checkbox</li>
<li>Should not need to confirm</li>
</ul>
