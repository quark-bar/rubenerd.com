<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The best new holiday music! Great gift ideas!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We communicate by email when it comes to your orders, but if youâ€™d rather not get letters, specials, or other promotional emails (like this one), just click here to UNSUBSCRIBE.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Opt-out Email Confirmation
  Enter Email:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result after confirmation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[ADDRESS] has been unsubscribed</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>FAIL.</strong></p>

<ul><li>Should not need to confirm with another email</li>
</ul>

<p>This sucks, I love CD Baby.</p>
