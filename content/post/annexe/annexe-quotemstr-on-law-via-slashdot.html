<blockquote>Actually, the popularity of a law is its very basis for legitimacy, at least in a democratic society. Who gets to decide what policy can &ldquo;better service society&rdquo; except the very members of that society? The law should reflect common morality, not some notion three guys in a room decided was best.</blockquote>
