<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Box: Keep all your best ideas in one place, wherever you need them: on mobile, web — and now — your desktop. Learn more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>About Box | Unsubscribe | Privacy Policy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Firefox can’t establish a connection to the server at em.box.com.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>FAIL.</strong></p>

<ul><li>Endpoint error preventing unsubscribe is worst case</li>
</ul>
