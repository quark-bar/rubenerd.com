<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Understanding CMS</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Periodically, the WHIR will inform you of special products and other offers that we believe you will find helpful in your business or career. To STOP receiving promotional e-mails from theWHIR, please click here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To ensure that we recognize you in our database and honor your preferences, please confirm or enter your email address and then select from the options below.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result, after confirmation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your preferences have been saved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>FAIL.</strong></p>

<ul><li>Footer didn&rsquo;t have &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; so email filter couldn&rsquo;t catch</li>
<li>Should not need to confirm with another email</li>
</ul>
