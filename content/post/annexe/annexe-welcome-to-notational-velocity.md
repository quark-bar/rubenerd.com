*This originally appeared on the Annexe.*

I've preserved this first text file in Notational Velocity for posterity :).

> Welcome to Notational Velocity!
>
> This is the body of a note. Your notes can be as long or as short as you want, and you can embolden, italicize, or strike them.
> 
> Create links between notes: [[How does this thing work?]].
> 
> You can create as many notes as you want--NV can hold thousands of them and works best when content is distributed.
> 
> If you enable encryption (Preferences > Notes > Security) you can even store passwords and other sensitive information without giving a second thought to computer forensics laboratories.
> 
> These notes were included to get you started with Notational Velocity. You may delete them at any time.
