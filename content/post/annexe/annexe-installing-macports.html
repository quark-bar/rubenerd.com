<blockquote>
<p>Congratulations, you have successfully installed the MacPorts system. To get the Portfiles and update the system, run:</p>

<p><code>sudo port selfupdate</code></p>

<p>Please read port(1) and the MacPorts Wiki at <a href="http://trac.macports.org/">http://trac.macports.org/</a> for full documentation.</p>

<p>Stray sources might have been left in the legacy /opt/local/var/db/dports directory after this upgrade, which moved most of what it could to /opt/local/var/macports, so you might want to look in the former and cleanup manually.</p>
