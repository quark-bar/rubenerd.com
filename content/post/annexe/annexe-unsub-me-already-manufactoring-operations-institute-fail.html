<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Improve your manufacturing operations effectiveness</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We hope to have informed you sufficiently and are looking forward to your positive response. If you don&rsquo;t want to receive the information about MOMi Education in the future, you can unsubscribe here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We&rsquo;re sad to see you go.<br/>
  [x] Subscribe
  [ ] Unsubscribe</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>FAIL.</strong></p>

<ul><li>Shouldn&rsquo;t need to confirm with a checkbox</li>
<li>Defaulting to the Subscribe checkbox in the hopes people don&rsquo;t notice is the ultimate dick move.</li>
</ul>
