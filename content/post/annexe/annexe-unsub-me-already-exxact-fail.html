<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New Datapath iolite 600 Compact &amp; Quiet Video Wall Processor</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This email was sent to [ADDRESS]. If you no longer wish to receive these emails you may unsubscribe at any time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Email Unsubscribe<br/>
  Email Address: [ADDRESS]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result, after confirmation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Email Unsubscribe Confirmation. You have successfully unsubscribed from further marketing emails from Marketo.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>FAIL.</strong></p>

<ul><li>Should not need to confirm with another email</li>
</ul>
