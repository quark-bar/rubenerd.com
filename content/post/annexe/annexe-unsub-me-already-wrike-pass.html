<p style="font-style:italic;">This originally appeared on the Annexe, chronicling my adventures unsubscribing from email newsletters. The only acceptable outcome from clicking unsubscribe in an email footer is immediately being unsubscribed!</p>

<p>Footer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Click here to unsubscribe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Result:</p>
