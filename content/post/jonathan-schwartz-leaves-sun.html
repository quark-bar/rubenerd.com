<p>It&#39;s official, <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/">Jonathan Schwartz</a> is no longer an employee of Sun Microsystems, now a subsidiary of Oracle Inc. Fortunately for us in <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/where_life_takes_me_next">his goodbye blog post</a> he&#39;s said his blog will be transferred to a new address and maintained, and he&#39;s even <a href="http://twitter.com/openjonathan">jumped on Twitter</a> again.</p>

<blockquote><p>Today’s my last day at Sun. I’ll miss it. Seems only fitting to end on a #haiku. Financial crisis/Stalled too many customers/CEO no more</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#39;ve been a reader of my blog for a while you&#39;d know how much I admire Schwartz, one could say to an unhealthy extent. A quick paroozle of the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/jonathan-schwartz/">Jonathan Schwartz tag</a> here proves this, and <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p3797/">this unabashed brown-nosing post</a> from early 2009 would serve to remove all further doubt!</p>
<p>Sun might not have shot through all expectations and taken over the world during his tenure as CEO, but his down to earth friendlyness was refreshing, and I loved reading his official blog.</p>
<h3>Okay, the real reason!</h3>
<p>Steve Jobs may be a genius, but Jonathan would still be my first choice for hanging out at a coffee shop if I had the chance. For a period of time I even tried to grow a Schwartz ponytail but failed miserably. There&#39;s something about a CEO of a major corporation that can look classy with a ponytail that&#39;s just too awesome for words.</p>
<p>Anyway I wish Jonathan all the best in his future efforts, and I&#39;m excited to see where he goes from here. Who knows, I might still get to have coffee with him one day… coming to Singapore or Canberra any time soon Jon? :)</p>
