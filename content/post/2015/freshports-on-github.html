<p>Speaking of <a href="https://rubenerd.com/ncsa-httpd-archived/">projects on Git</a>, the venerable <a href="https://freshports.org/">FreshPorts</a> has published its <a href="https://github.com/FreshPorts/freshports">site source</a>. That was a <a href="https://rubenerd.com/freshports-on-github/">lot of links</a>.</p>

<p>Dan Langille still also needs your <a href="https://dan.langille.org/2015/03/05/please-give-me-your-lto-4-or-better-tape-library/">LTO tapes and drives</a>.</p>
