<p>I’ve realised there’s a direct correlation between the time of night, and prevalence of these error messages:</p>

<pre>
"E492: Not an editor command: Wq" 
</pre>

<p>I swear, my tombstone will have this on it. Which will suck, because it means I couldn't save my changes before quitting the living world.</p>

<p>I should just use ZZ, but old habits are hard to break.</p>
