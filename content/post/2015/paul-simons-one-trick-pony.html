<p>I’ve been listening to Paul Simon’s 1980 album <a style="font-style:italic;" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003UPBS6C/?tag=rubenerdcom-20">One Trick Pony</a> at work. It’s quiet, melodic, beautiful and typically clever. It’s also more conducive to systems development than I thought.</p>
<p>AllMusic’s <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/one-trick-pony-mw0000191848">William Ruhlmann</a> dismissed the album as a “disappointment in both artistic and commercial terms” and being lyrically “not up to his usual standard”. I would disagree, with just a few examples.</p>
<p>From “How The Heart Approaches What It Yearns”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the rain on the interstate<br />
Headlights slide past the moon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From “Oh, Marion”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The more I get to thinking;<br />
The less I tend to laugh.</p>
<p>The boy’s got a brain;<br />
He just abstains.</p>
<p>The boy’s got a voice;<br />
But his words don’t connect to his eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From “God Bless the Absentee”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This country’s changed so fast.<br />
The future is the present;<br />
The present’s in the past.<br />
The highways are in litigation;<br />
The airports disagree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the eponymous song, having viewed that <em>One Trick Pony</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He makes me think about<br />
All of these extra movements I make<br />
And all of this herky-jerky motion<br />
And the bag of tricks it takes<br />
To get me through my working day</p>
</blockquote>
