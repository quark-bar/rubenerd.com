<p>My boss Alan shared this video from his dashcam. The driver makes a right turn from the far left lane, only to have the police appear.</p>

<p>In general, drivers around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascot,_New_South_Wales">Mascot</a> are still <em>far</em> better than those in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earlwood,_New_South_Wales">Earlwood</a>. But Iâ€™ve still almost been clipped crossing that very intersection as a pedestrian.</p>
