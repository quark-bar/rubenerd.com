<p>Below is an <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.org.operators.ausnog/18937">exerpt from George Fong</a> on the AusNog mailing lists:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.org.operators.ausnog/18937">
<p>In terms of timelines, keep in mind that if  you are subject to the data retention  legislation, then your DR Implementation Plan (DRIP) is due in by 13th August and the requirement to hold and retain metadata starts on 13th October unless you have successfully applied for an exemption or extension of time. Not a lot of time! </p>

<p>DRIP. I love it.</p>

<p>Time to get your VPNs, proxies and remote jump boxes set up to bypass this <strong>farcial</strong> law. The 13th of October will come faster than you think.</p>
