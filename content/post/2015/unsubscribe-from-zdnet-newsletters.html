<p>Let’s give my new <a href="https://rubenerd.com/newsletter-unsubscribe-scorecard/">newsletter–unsubscribe score card</a> a spin! Today we have ZDNet, and the newsletters I started receiving after creating an account.</p>

<p>I tried unsubscribing by clicking the link in their latest email, which took me to a confirmation page. I didn't provide an answer, and just clicked Submit. It should have unsubscribed me, becuase providing a reason is usually (and should be) optional. Instead:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Why are you unsubscribing?] Empty Mandatory Attribute<br />
[Your Reason] Empty Mandatory Attribute</p>

<p>Please click your browser's back button, fix the above errors and re-submit your details. Thank you.</p> 
</blockquote>

<p>So I left them with this reason:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not allowing people to unsubscribe without providing a reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They get 40/100.</p>
