<p>Our collective ambivilence to government metadata retention may be understandable now; people are okay doing it to their ones.

<blockquote cite="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/24/nearly-half-of-young-people-say-tracking-partners-using-technology-is-acceptable">
<p>Almost half of young Australians believe tracking their partner by going through their computer or phone, or by installing phone and computer tracking software, is acceptable.</p>

<p>This was one of the findings from a nationally representative survey of 1923 people aged between 16 and 24 about their attitudes towards violence against women. The results were launched by VicHealth in Melbourne on Thursday.</p>

<p>Although 84% agreed tracking a partner by electronic means without her consent was serious, 46% said it was acceptable to some degree.</p>

<p>Talk about a lack of respect. Unfortunately, that's not the scariest observation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And 20% of those surveyed said women often said “no” to sexual activity when they meant “yes”, and 18% agreed if a woman was raped while affected by alcohol or drugs she was partly responsible.</p>

<p>Do kindly sod off.</p>
