That could be read as Facebook enjoying the purchasing of spam, and I'm not sure my hyphen cleared this up much. Oh well, you like some, you lose some.

Our corpoate spam filters do a pretty good job at getting rid of most of the muck, but occasionally one slips through.

I find their assertion regarding my lack of popularity insulting, even if likely true. And what's wrong with Turkish likes? They're not part of "worldwide"?
