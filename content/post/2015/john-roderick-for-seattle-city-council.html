<p>As my correct Commonwealth spelling and <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">non-rhotic accent</a> would confirm, I am not American. Nor, I shamefully admit, have I been there yet. Judging from my server logs and Twitter mentions however, my online activities draw more attention from the US (and Canada) than any other place.</p>

<p>To my wonderful American friends, this post is for you.</p>

<p>For the last year, I've been a listener of <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/">Roderick on the Line</a>, Merlin Mann's candid weekly podcast with John Roderick of The Long Winters. Supertrain. Despite jovially hearing about the show from Back to Work dozens of times, it took me a while to come over. I'm a IT nerd, and figured it wouldn't have much to offer me.</p>

<p>Good grief though. John is, without a doubt, one of the most fascinating, candid, honest, delightful people on the interwebs. I would say that about Merlin Mann too, but he's ego has surely been stroked enough on this site.</p>

<p>More importantly in the context of this post however, he's also (as we would say in Australia) <em>an ideas man, Steve</em>. His discussion of zipline and supertrain transit systems belie a deep appreciation of (and ability to propose) alternate, unconventional solutions to complex problems. We really don't need another stinking freeway, we need real change.</p> 

<p style="font-style:italic">(As it stands, both Sydney and Melbourne here are going through similar debates, with opposition voices falling on deaf ears. It would have been enough for even the me of a few years ago to get cynical).</p>

<p>As you've grokked from the title, John is now running for Seattle City Council. Frankly, as an Australian/Singaporean I am neither legally nor ethically able to financially contribute to his campaign. What I can do though is spread the word, and I encourage you to as well.</p> 

<p>If you're an American (especially those in Washington state), you owe it to all of us, not least those in Seattle, to <a href="http://www.voteroderick.com/donate/">contribute</a>. You can also <a href="http://www.voteroderick.com/volunteer/">volunteer to be a minion</a>.</p>
