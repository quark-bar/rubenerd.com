<p>I direct your attention to the co–star of last year's surprisingly good 3D movie <em>Expelled from Paradise</em>, voiced by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rie_Kugimiya">Queen of Tsundere</a> herself. Specifically, take note of the device she's using:</p>

<p>No, I'm not referring to her <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FormFittingWardrobe">gravity defying leotard</a>, or her otherwise traditionally constructed closed headphones (though the material science of both may be fascinating). She's using a music player or a phone equipped with a translucent display.</p>

<p>Whether it's the last episode of <em>Star Trek Voyager</em>, or <em>Minority Report</em>, or Tony Stark's wall mounted screens, futuristic displays necessiate them being translucent. This suggests two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Technology has advanced to where translucent screens are possible</li>
<li>Society deems them useful and practical</li>
</ol>

<p>Point 1 is already partly true. <abbr title="heads-up displays">HUDs</abbr> on aircraft, flexible <abbr title="organic light-emitting diode">OLED</abbr> displays and possibly even projectors allow this. At some point though, they'll be bright and affordable enough to be used everywhere.</p>

<p>Point 2 is more difficult. Just because something is technically possible, should we do it?

<p>When we got high resolution screens with billions of colours, it took over a decade of <abbr title="On–screen elements designed to match the real world. An abused term of late">skeuomorphic</abbr> designs before we scaled back to simpler (pardon, “flatter”) interfaces. When Netscape implemented the <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> element, we had to endure it on sites before good (better?) taste prevailed. I'm sure you could list plenty more examples.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic">(Yes, I was in primary school at the time, and my first websites were flooded with marquees. We all do crazy things when we're young).</p>

<p>At some point, a translucent screened smartphone will appear. Maybe it will help people watch where they're going! But I'm unconvinced that just because point 1 is true, that point 2 necessarily follows (or that it even should).</p>

<p>Who knows, after a few generations of translucent devices, shipping with a solid background may be a selling point. Then we really would have come full circle.</p>
