<p>Dear Ruben</p>

<p>We’re very pleased to announce, in partnership with Transport for NSW, that the Opal Concession card will be available for eligible students at UTS from next Monday 27 July.</p>

<p>This is great news because the Opal Concession card comes packed with so many benefits for students, like:</p>

<ul>
<li>the cheapest single fares</li>
<li>off-peak train fares – save 30%</li>
<li>a daily travel cap of $7.50*</li>
<li>a weekly travel cap of $30*</li>
<li>your balance is protected if your card is lost or stolen</li>
</ul>

<p>plus [sic], you can earn free travel with the Opal Weekly Travel Reward: after 8 paid journeys in a week you travel the rest of the week for free.*</p>

<p>* Excludes Sydney Airport station access fee</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just in time for graduation!</p>

<p>To put in perspective, Opal cards were rolled out between 2012 and last year. Senior and Junior concession cards were rolled out much sooner. UTS may have also had <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/student-opal-card-privacy-concerns-limit-university-participation-20141228-12c0y9.html">privacy concerns</a>; if so, I'd be interested to hear what assuaged them.</p>
