<p>Want to run one of the worldâ€™s first web servers? TooDumbForAName is <a href="https://github.com/TooDumbForAName/ncsa-httpd">preserving them</a> on GitHub.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a copy of the NCSA HTTPd source code. NCSA HTTPd was the first web server to see widespread use. I'm attempting to preserve each relase in-tree by tag, but some releases have apparently already been lost to the world; 0.5 is the earliest I've found so far</p>

<p>As a digital <del>hoarder</del> archivist, I locally cloned this repo faster than Mosaic would have rendered it on hardware at the time.</p>
