This post was supposed to be a draft markdown table test, but it published anyway.

Now that itâ€™s here, I may as well explain. This is a table of KVMs and their capabilities. I'm looking into them for my home workstation setup, and need one with VGA and either 2 USB ports or 2 PS/2 ports.

More to come in a proper post.
