<p>I don’t always see eye–to–eye with DHH, but damn it if he didn't <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3924-grit-is-for-cowboys">hit close to home</a> with this one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grit is a convenient trait for enticing others to comply with the uncomfortable or the uninteresting [Ruben adding: or the untenable]. It elevates the perseverance of such adversity to a virtue in and of itself. Just dangle that long-term goal in front of them, accuse them of lack of grit, and compliance will oft follow.</p>

<p>But far more important than to be capable of suffering for your cause is to ask “what cause”? Am I the beneficiary here, or is someone else? Being high on grit may well mean sticking with a faulty cause for far longer.</p>

<p>Grit is an optimization for local maxima. If you’re able to change the function, drop the grit.</p>
