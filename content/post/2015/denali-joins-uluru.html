<p>I knew all about Denali from my years of listening to <em>Whole Wheat Radio</em>, the former independent music radio station out of Alaska. While it was officially called Mount McKinley after America's president during their war with the Spanish, the native name of Denali seemed to be more widely used.</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia, its original name has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denali">been restored</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Denali, officially known as Mount McKinley from 1917 until 2015, is the highest mountain peak in North America, with a summit elevation of 20,237 feet (6,168 m) above sea level. At some 18,000 feet (5,500 m), the base-to-peak rise is considered the largest of any mountain situated entirely above sea level.</p>

<p>In 2015, following the lead of the state of Alaska, the United States government announced the mountain would be renamed from Mount McKinley, for former President William McKinley, to its original Athabascan name of Denali.</p>

<p>This is wonderful news, and made me smile :).</p>

<p>Here in Australia, our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluru">Uluru</a> rock formation was known for years as Ayers Rock. It was renamed to "Ayers Rock / Uluru" in 1993, and dual named Uluru and Ayers Rock in 2002. Our colonial ancestors pillaged and stole all this land, the least we can do now is call them by their correct names.</p>
