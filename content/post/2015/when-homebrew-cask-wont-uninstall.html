<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask">homebrew-cask</a> to install my Mac application bundles. Once installed, it means you can either script this or run from the shell:</p>

<pre>
$ brew update
$ brew cask install seamonkey
</pre>

<p>Unlike software from other *nix package managers, Mac applications usually update themselves once installed. <a href="http://sparkle-project.org/">Sparkle</a> is the nicest way to do this, but Mozilla, LibreOffice and others bundle their own updaters. Regardless, it means the version homebrew-cask installed may not match the version you're currently running, which leads to this:</p>

<pre>
$ brew list | grep seamonkey
==&gt; seamonkey
$ brew cask remove seamonkey
==&gt; Error: seamonkey is not installed
</pre>

<p>I encountered this late at night the first time, and thought I was going crazy. The jury is still out on that, but the <a href="https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/pull/6208">force</a> command will allow its removal:</p>

<pre>
$ brew cask remove --force seamonkey
==&gt; Removing App symlink: '/Users/ruben/Applications/SeaMonkey.app'
</pre>

<p>There’s a closed <a href="https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/7409">bug report on GitHub</a> about this.</p>
