<p>The ease (or lack thereof) of unsubscribing from email newsletters has become a recurring theme here for <a href="https://rubenerd.com/spam-unsubscribe-gives-cafepresss-life-story/">almost ten years</a>. It came to a head last year, when the phenomena of <a href="https://rubenerd.com/youre-subscribed-to-our-new-mailing-list/">abusing customer email lists</a> became the norm.</p>

<p>So for future reference, I’ll be grading sites based on the following criteria:</p>

<pre>
[ ] Newsletter was opt-in in the first place
[ ] Unsubscribe link exists in newsletter
[ ] No need to confirm unsubscribe
[ ] No need to login to unsubscribe
[ ] No need to find “email preferences”
[ ] Reasonable time to unsubscribe (&lt; 48 hours)
</pre>

<p>A site needs all six to get 100%. One unticked box deducts 50%, then 10% for each subsequent box. As far as I’m concerned, slipping on two or more of these represents a failure.</p>
