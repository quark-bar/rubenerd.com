<p>It includes fixes and mitigations for six CVEs, rated from low to moderate. From the <a href="https://openssl.org/news/secadv_20150611.txt">security advisory</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Logjam man-in-the-middle attack</li>
<li>Malformed ECParameters causes infinite loop (CVE-2015-1788)</li>
<li>Exploitable out-of-bounds read in X509_cmp_time (CVE-2015-1789)</li>
<li>PKCS7 crash with missing EnvelopedContent (CVE-2015-1790)</li>
<li>CMS verify infinite loop with unknown hash function (CVE-2015-1792)</li>
<li>Race condition handling NewSessionTicket (CVE-2015-1791)</li>
<li>Invalid free in DTLS (CVE-2014-8176)</li>
</ol>

<p>All are rated moderate or low. Therefore, none worthy of their own website (well, maybe other than Logjam?). As usual, patch and so on.</p>

<p>Or, you could take your chances (as so many have told me to) and use a fork. If this software continues to have issues despite being entrenched and a <em>de facto</em> standard, I'm sure your offshoot with huge swaths of code changes and far less testing will be more secure.</p>
