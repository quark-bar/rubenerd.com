<p>As mentioned on <em><a href="https://rubenerd.com/show290/">Rubenerd Show 290</a></em>, the limited 64GiB SSD capacity of my mid-2012 MacBook Air is starting to get difficult. Whereas previously I'd just offload stuff to a series of Sandisk Extreme USB 3.0 memory keys, it seems now I can't even turn the machine on half the time without the Finder reporting <em>“Zero bytes free”</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve re-installed OS X on it twice, checked the Hibernation and sleep images aren’t ballooning to unreasonable sizes, and performed various voodoo chants. The space just vanishes, and I grow wary of constantly tracking down where it all goes. Time for an upgrade!</p>

<p>My go-to for such stuff is usually <a href="https://crucial.com/">Crucial</a>. Their compatibility search engine has been invaluable for years, which I thank them for with my patronage. Perhaps given Apple's proprietary SSD layout, they don't offer any options for the Airs though.</p>

<p>From my early Mac days I remembered <a href="http://www.macsales.com/">Other World Computing</a> in the US had the best deals for Mac-compatible hardware, and sure enough they have a series of <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/SSD/OWC/Air-Retina/Apple-MacBook-Air-2012-Drive-Internal-Flash">Aura and Aura Pro SSDs</a>. Their lowest capacity <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/search/MBA2012A.120">120GiB drive</a> is already almost twice the capacity of my current one, and they go up to 1TiB.</p> 

<p>My plan is to grab a <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/SSDAP2A6G240/">240GB Aura Pro 6G</a> once money becomes available. Stay tuned for reviews :).</p>
