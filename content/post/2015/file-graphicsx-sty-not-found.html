<p>Got this error when compiling a <span style="font-family:serif; letter-spacing:-2px;">L<span style="vertical-align:super">A</span>T<span style="vertical-align:sub">E</span>X</span> document this morning, like a gentleman:</p>
<pre>
mactex ! LaTeX Error: File `graphicsx.sty' not found.
</pre>
<p><em>That’s absurd</em>, I thought! I’ve done this a thousand times, with the standard <a href="https://tug.org/mactex/">MacTeX</a> distribution, and never <em>once</em> had that issue. The pertinent part of my source looked perfectly legitimate:</p>
<pre>
\usepackage{graphicsx}
</pre>
<p>And then the realisation hit me like so many bad cups of coffee.</p>
<pre>
\usepackage{graphicx}
</pre>
<p>For those who can’t see, there’s no plural for graphics.</p>
<p>Adding for reference here, because I couldn’t find a <em>single</em> search result of someone else having this problem. Hopefully if you found this through a search, I’ve spared you the same frustration.</p>
