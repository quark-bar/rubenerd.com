<p>I'd been having this issue whenever installing <a href="http://caskroom.io/">casks</a>:</p>

<pre>
$ brew cask install macvim

==&gt; This subcommand requires root privileges: bsexec
Error: Empty plist input
</pre>

<p>This was a <a href="https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/10731">known bug</a>, and has been addressed with a newer version.</p>

<pre>
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade caskroom/cask/brew-cask
</pre>

<p>Be prepared for this to take a while.</p>

<pre>
==&gt; Checking out tag v0.54.0
[..] 10M, built in 7.0 minutes
</pre>

<p>I've had mixed to positive success with Homebrew Cask, but itâ€™s just useful enough to keep it around for installing Mac applications. XQuartz, Tunnelblick and a few others are still tricky, as they require admin access or wizard installs.</p>
