<p>There are dozens, if not trillons, of guides out there showing us how to use reprepro to create and add packages to a deb repository. Much as the documentation for their end user package manager bretherin however, there's scant info anywhere about how to <em>update</em> an already existing package to a newer version.</p>

<p>To start, when you add a package you do this:</p>

<pre>
reprepro -b /repopath includedeb wheezy package_1.0.0_arch.deb
</pre>

<p>To update, you don't need to delete the previous, you just add the next version:</p>

<pre>
reprepro -b /srv/repopath includedeb wheezy package_1.0.1_arch.deb
</pre>
