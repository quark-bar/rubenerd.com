<p>We haven’t had a <em><a href="https://rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">Pointless Rubenerd Milestone</a></em> in ages. And what an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraphobia">unfortunate number</a> to have one of, let alone three in a row!</p>

<p>I posted about <a href="https://rubenerd.com/666-post/">666 posts in 2007</a>, hence the above image. In a few years, I'll have that number of pages. Cool.</p>
