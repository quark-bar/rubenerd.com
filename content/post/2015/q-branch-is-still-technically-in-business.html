<p>John Gruber <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/06/02/resigning_from_q_branch">recently blogged</a> about the departure of Brent Simmons from Q Branch, the company that built his Vesper notes application.

<blockquote>
<p>For Q Branch and Vesper, life goes on. We donâ€™t have anything to announce today, other than that this is not the end.</p>
