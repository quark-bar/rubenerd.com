<p>For some of my American readers, the Westminster system can seem a little strange. We don’t have an executive or legislative wings; the Head of Government is merely the head of the governing party or coalition. The <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Senate/Powers_practice_n_procedures/Constitution">Australian Constitution</a> doesn’t even make mention of a Prime Minister. </p>
<p>This morning, conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott has survived a spill motion against him. During a secret ballot in his party room, 32 voted in favour, 61 against, with one who couldn’t figure out <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/liberal-leadership-spill-one-confused-mp-casts-informal-vote-20150208-139f7s.html">how to vote</a>.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, he’s heaving a sigh of relief. Recent Australian political history would suggest though that once your leadership has been questioned, you’re never entirely out of the woods. Mark Kenny has a <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/tony-abbotts-removal-as-prime-minister-not-a-case-of-if-but-when-20150208-139f2p.html">great article</a> in the Sydney Morning Herald about this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This now, is a prime minister who leads in name only and governs with a sword of Damocles hanging over his head.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Worse still for the PM, he’s the least popular in Australian history with a 24% approval rating. I said in January that Mr Abbott is Australia’s George W. Bush; I’m not even sure he had such low numbers.</p>
