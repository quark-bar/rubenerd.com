<p>I had a chat with my dad earlier this year about blogging. He independently made the observation many of us in the tech space have long noticed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I've tried writing on the internet, on lots of different car and motorcycle forums and all of those, but every time I do, I'd say three quarters of the responses are useless. There's constructive criticism, but these are just destructive. What do they get out of it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good question. Too bad Iâ€™ll never know, I only chat with nice people now.</p>
