<p>Video taken in <a href="https://vimeo.com/115714766">Marina Bay after midnight</a> on an iPhone 5s. Still blows my mind we can record 1080p video on our phones now.</p>

<p>The last time I was in Singapore for New Year was 2010. My tiny island home has changed so much in that time, I barely recognise parts of it now.</p>

<p>More posts, photos and such soon.</p>
