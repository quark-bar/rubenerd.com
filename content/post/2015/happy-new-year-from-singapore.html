<p>Video taken in Marina Bay after midnight on an iPhone 5s. Still blows my mind we can record 1080p video on our phones now.</p>
<p>The last time I was in Singapore for New Year was 2010. My tiny island home has changed so much in that time, I barely recognise parts of it now.</p>
<p>More posts, photos and such soon.</p>
