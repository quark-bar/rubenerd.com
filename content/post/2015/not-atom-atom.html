<p>This was the headline that ran on Hacker News, that bastion of online integrity:</p>

<blockquote>
Atom 1.0
</blockquote>

<p>Hold on, I thought, Atom 1.0 was released a decade ago. Atom is a syndication format designed to reign in the numerous incompatible versions of RSS, though they had enough of a sense of humour to release multiple versions themselves (WordPress exported Atom 0.3 and 1.0 feeds at the time).

<p>Yes, this is for the Atom text editor, based on "web technologies" (oh dear).</p>

<p>I know familiary breeds contempt, but I'm really starting to get over this high–churn ecosystem. I'll be sticking with Vim, not just because its what I'm used to, but in protest to this flash–in–the–pan, short–attention–span, name–reusing, JavaScript–everywhere nonsense. Hey, at least their site doesn't have auto playing video or those awful long scrolling pages.</p>

<p>Whoa, I don't think I've ever sounded this old before. I may still be in my twenties for now, but get off my lawn!</p>
