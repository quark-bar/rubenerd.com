<p>Matthew Proctor made an interesting point in his article <a href="http://www.crn.com.au/Feature/407626,when-will-voip-kill-the-telephone.aspx">When will VoIP kill the telephone</a>. But with a pretty big caveat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Try it. Pick a customer, a vendor or a friend that you call regularly. Now put their email address into your favourite unified communications client, such as Skype, Lync or Facebook Messenger, and the likelihood is you’ll never spend a cent on calling them on your telephone again.</p>

<p>For my next business, I won’t be getting a telephone number, let alone any handsets. But people will still be able to call me, using just my email address.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Two words: emgergency services. When you’re panicking, can’t find your mobile, your internet is down or there’s no reception, you <strong>don’t have time</strong> to think twice. Family history informs this.</p>

<p>For that reason alone, I insist on having a landline, even if I don’t ever use it. And you should too.</p>
