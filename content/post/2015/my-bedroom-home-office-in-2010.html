<p>While cleaning some virtual space, I found this old photo taken in Balmoral Park. A few months later, we'd moved back to Sydney from Singapore.</p>

<p>All those machines are with me and still work, albeit in more limited capacities. I'm still a <em>K-On!</em> fan. And I still lament having to live out of boxes, now that I'm moving again.</p>

<p>One day I'll have permanency, you wait and see!</p>
