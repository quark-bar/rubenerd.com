<p>I've been a <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd">Flickr Pro</a> for about a decade, and a Flickr Pro subscriber for almost as long. So when I saw this email subject line this morning, I knew it couldn't be good.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[Flickr] Your Flickr Pro subscription just got better!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not cynical (said every cynic ever!), but I know that whenever a price hike is in order, it’s standard practice to bury it under other stuff. Sure enough, under a list of new features:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For new subscribers, Flickr Pro is $49.99 per year or $5.99 per month.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is double what it used to be. But they’re quick to reassure us:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And here is where it gets good as a Loyal Flickr Pro Member [..] You get these additional Flickr Pro features and continue to receive unlimited space, with no change in price for the next 2 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s akin to those <em>“50 months interest free!”</em> offers; we don't have to pay now, so it’s all good. I bristle when companies do this.</p>

<p>Flickr is a wonderful service; I don’t post nearly enough stuff to it. They've generally done a good job maintaining and updating the interface. With a decade of inflation and uncertainty at Yahoo!, it stands to reason they'd want a little extra money to stay afloat.</p>

<p>Still, as <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/">John Roderick</a> would say, $50 is a much bigger eel than $25.</p>
