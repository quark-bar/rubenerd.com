<p>By and large, spammers seem to have lost their creative zeal. In a pinch, they can spearfish or render a comically–bad bank notice, but they don't put the literary effort or leaps of logic that they used to.</p>

<p>The good news is, there are still seemingly those dedicated to the craft. Below is an excerpt from one I received today:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I was analyzing your site and it seems that some of your website rankings have dropped. It is due to non optimized techniques/errors</p>

<p>And Google guidelines not being followed properly. As you
know that Google’s crawler is software and work on coding basis only.</p>

<p>That’s why site coding portion should be strong for
better results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We've all read SEO snakeoil, but this is the first time I've read "Google uses code, so you should make yours better!" as an argument. Well played.</p>

<p>For what its worth, the Bourne shell and Go code that generates this site is rather fabulous, thank you very much.</p>
