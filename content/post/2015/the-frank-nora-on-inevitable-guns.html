I've started listening to Frank Nora's The Overnightscape again recently. I listened obsessivel



<blockquote>
<p>It's called The Void. Of course, you have guns and you're shooting things.</p>

<p>I don't know, maybe I'm out of touch with the world, but I'm tired of all the violence in all these [rides, video games]. Why can't we have an attraction without anyone getting shot, or stabbed? Holy fuck, enough of this stuff. It's ridiculous.</p>

<p>Do people love it that much that we need to have it in everything?</p>

<p>All the good games. Even this VR stuff... oh, you have a gun, you're a warrior. Okay, okay. Why can't we just be nice?</p>
</blockquote>

Ditto for movies as well.

My late mum made the point that hospital dramas are for those without. Maybe violent movies and games are for those who aren't in violent places.
