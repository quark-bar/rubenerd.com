<p>How does the old saying go about those who can dish it out, but can't take it? Here are two simple tests for it:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you say something you wouldn’t tolerate being said to you. That makes you a douchebag.</p></li>
<li><p>If you get precious when someone quotes back what you just said to them, verbatim. That makes you a hypocrite.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This includes outward and passive aggression. Don’t choose (tacitly or overtly) to be one of those people.</p>
