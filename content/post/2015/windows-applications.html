<p>From the <a href="http://www.fosshub.com/qBittorrent.html">qBittorrent</a> download page:</p>

<blockquote><p><p>Note regarding the installation: There's nothing hidden in this app, no bundles, no unwanted ads or anything like that. It's 100% clean so the setup process should be easy enough and without any unwaranted advertising. Just remember that although the application itself is clean, you are responsible for the data that you will upload or download through a torrent.</p></blockquote>

<p>It's a low bar for your platform when vendors have to say this.</p>
