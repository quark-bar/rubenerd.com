<p>I think this is the first time my three homes have been on the Wikipedia homepage at the same time.</p>

<p>The ruling People's Action Party, led by Lee Hsien Loong, retains its majority in the Singaporean general election.</p>

<p>“Home” in this context referring to where I’ve grown up, and consider home. I do not, nor could I with my limited financial resources, <strong><em>own</em></strong> real estate in these three places. A nice apartment in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damansara_Perdana">Damansara Perdana</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outram,_Singapore">Outram Park</a> and a leafy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Suburbs">northern Sydney suburb</a> would be lovely though.</p>
