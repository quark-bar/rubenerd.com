WordPress are running their [yearly survey](http://wp-survey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2015) again, as I'm sure you already surmised from the title of this post. Most were multiple choice, but two were free-form text. I leave these here for whatever they're worth.

<dl>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">What's the best thing about WordPress?</dt>
<dd>Its large and active support base.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">What's the most frustrating thing about WordPress?
<dd>Security (locking down the default install, disabling features, etc).<p></p></dd>
