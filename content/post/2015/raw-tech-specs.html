<p>This <a href="http://www.birchtree.me/blog/who-buys-ipods">article by Matt Bircher</a> discusses iPods, but this paragraph is relevent to the entire consumer tech sector.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The average tech nerd will look at the $149 price of the Nano and compare it to the $199 Touch and wonder why someone wouldn't spend the extra $50 to get "so much more." This question simply displays a lack of understanding as to how the market at large currently works. It's similar to someone saying "why would you buy an iPad when you can buy a Windows laptop of the same price that does more?" You can't always say what's best for people to buy based on the raw tech specs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yet, Android and Windows device makers still largely sell them like this.</p>

<p>It reminds me of a quip about Commodore's marketing department in the 80s. The Amiga was sushi, but they sold it as raw fish.</p>
