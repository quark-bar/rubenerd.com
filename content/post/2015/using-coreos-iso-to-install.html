<p>This morning I posted how CoreOS <a href="http://localhost:1313/coreos-needs-a-gig-of-memory/">needed more memory</a> than its name implied. I also had an adventure with the installer.</p>

<p>If you look at the <a href="https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/installing-to-disk.html">official install docs</a> for CoreOS, you install from ISO with this command:</p>

<pre>
$ sudo su - root
# coreos-install -d /dev/sda
</pre>

<p>Except you can't. The ISO doesn't contain the production image. Or if it did, it wasn't made clear and/or I couldn't find it.</p>

<p>So I update my networking, to allow it to download.</p>

<pre>
# ifconfig eth0 &lt;ethernet-ip/24&gt;
# route add default gw &lt;gateway-ip&gt;
</pre>

<p>Still no dice, it complained it couldn't resolve the address. Shoot yes, I didn't have an entry in resolv.conf.</p>

<pre>
echo "208.67.220.220" &gt;&gt; /etc/resolv.conf
</pre>

Still nothing. As John Cleese said of a certain gentleman's walk, this was getting rather silly.

<p>Reading the documentation, you define networking in the following horrible systemd path. So I edited the file:</p>

<pre>
vim /etc/systemd/network/static.network
</pre>

<p>And added the following:</p>

<pre>
[Match]
Name=eth0

[Network]
Address=&lt;ethernet-ip&gt;
Gateway=&lt;gateway-ip&gt;
DNS=208.67.220.220
</pre>

<p>Then it was simply a matter of restarting networking:</p>

<pre>
# service network restart
==&gt; -su: service: command not found
</pre>

<p>Then it was simply a matter of restarting networking, using systemd's more streamlined syntax:</p>

<pre>
# systemctl restart systemd-networkd
</pre>

<p>And finally we were cooking with gas.</p>

<pre>
==&gt; Downloading, writing and verifying coreos_production_image.bin.bz2...
</pre>

<p>You'll also want to specify a cloud-config as well.</p>
