<p>I’m lying down in bed doing the worst thing you can do: staring at my smartphone. Such is my love for this new thing, I jeopardise my potential sleep to tell you about it.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve been waking up with a pain in my neck, and for once it’s not Tony Abbott (oh, burn). My ancient pillow had lost much of its supportive plumpness, but putting a second pillow underneath cricked my neck far too high.</p>
<p>So I decided to get a new one. I was at IKEA over the weekend, like a gentleman, and noticed they had a huge selection of them. Of interest, was a firm, ergonomic-shaped <em>RÖLLEKA</em>. It was only $25, so I figured what’s the harm?</p>
<p>It’s amazing. I lie on my side, and the valley in the centre of the pillow cradles my head perfectly. Where the pillow arches back up again, it supports my neck without being uncomfortable.</p>
<p>My only gripe would be the size; compared to my previous pillows it’s barely two-thirds the width. It means if I roll over in the middle of the night, I have to adjust the pillow to compensate for my new position. A larger pillow with the same shape would be magical.</p>
<p>Still, for the price and shape, I would recommend this pillow. I would highly recommend it. And hey, you could get some Swedish meatballs while you’re picking one up.</p>
<p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to sleep.</p>
