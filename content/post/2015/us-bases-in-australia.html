<p>In the context of a wider US marine deployment to Darwin, Ruby Jones and Xavier La Canna from ABC News <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-04-11/academics-word-of-caution-over-us-troop-rotation-in-darwin/6385680">reported this interesting observation</a> I hadn't thought of:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Under the deal struck between former prime minister Julia Gillard and US president Barack Obama, the number of US Marines rotating through Darwin each year will gradually increase to become 2,500 troops by 2017.</p>

<p>Mr O'Connor said while Australians may be in favour of the deal while Mr Obama is the US president, the agreement is a long-term deal and it may lose public support in Australia if a Republican president wins office.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For people outside Australia, Darwin is our most northern city. Within a hour or so flight, you're in Asia.</p>
