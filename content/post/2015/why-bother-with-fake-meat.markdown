[A Slashdot discussion](http://science.slashdot.org/story/15/10/14/1858256/a-fresh-take-on-fake-meat) linked to an article regarding [new mock meat](http://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/impossible-foods-raises-a-whopping-108-million-for-its-plant-based-burgers/#.sgaspp:x3oA). Unsurprisingly, this comment was representative:

I'm often questioned the same way when I drink decaf coffee or non-alcoholic beer. It's not seen as a personal choice, itâ€™s an illogical affront. We "bother" because we choose to, which means you can choose not to. What a concept!

I know those asking the question are being facetious, but if you're vegetarian for ethical or environmental reasons, having mock meat that has a lower impact and harm is a good thing. And best of all, you can still eat real meat if you prefer!
