<p>Every website and their dog are now using Outbrain, Taboola and such to link to other articles. Their slick marketing material have you believe they're providing valuable resources (34 celebs you won't believe!), but we all know they don't.</p>

<p>NoScript blocks their JavaScript from loading, so problem solved. If you're not a whitelisting pedant like me, you can also use the <a href="https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/fanboy-annoyance.txt">Fanboy Annoyance list</a> in your ad–blocker of choice. Even if you don't like ad–blockers on principle, you could just use them for this blocking task.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in the discusson about why we dislike these servies, the reason for their existance was lost. Namely, that online publishers are struggling to get income. Until this is resolved, we can only expect (regrettably) self-defeating junk like this to get worse. </p>
