<p>The Christian Science Monitor had an <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2011/0104/Could-you-pass-a-US-citizenship-test/Who-signs-bills">online quiz of 96 questions</a> that can appear on a US citizenship test. From the intro:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order to become a US citizen, immigrants must pass the Naturalization Test. American citizenship bestows the right to vote, improves the likelihood of family members living in other countries to come and live in the US, gives eligibility for federal jobs, and can be a way to demonstrate loyalty to the US. Applicants must get 6 answers out of 10 in an oral exam to pass the test. According to US Citizenship and Immigration services, 92 percent of applicants pass this test.</p>

<p>You must get 58 or more of these test questions correct in order to pass.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, why not! So I did the test.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You answered 81 of 96 questions correctly for a total score of 85%.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Among the questions I got wrong, I specified “none of the above” under “What is the economic system of the US” instead of “Capitalism”. I also didn't know how many sitting senators and Supreme Court justices there are. But not a bad effort I reckon. Have I done my American friends proud?</p>

<p>Also, I wonder if there’s a Singapore test somewhere?</p>
