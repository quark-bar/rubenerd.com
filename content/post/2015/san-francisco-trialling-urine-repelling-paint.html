<p>Today's bandaid–solution story comes <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33682342">from the BBC</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be warned: If you pee on a wall in San Francisco it may come straight back.
The city's public works agency says it is testing a new urine-repellent paint in areas popular with people looking to relieve themselves.</p>

<p>Anyone choosing to use the treated walls as a toilet will see their urine "bounce back", according to a spokeswoman for the agency.</p>

<p>In a trial project, San Francisco authorities have painted nine walls in areas close to bars and in neighbourhoods with large homeless populations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose it’s easier than dealing with socioeconomic issues that may lead to someone doing that in the first place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Signs posted on the walls, written in English, Chinese and Spanish, say: "Hold it! ... seek relief in an appropriate place".

<p>"The idea is they will think twice next time about urinating in public," said Rachel Gordon, a spokeswoman for the city's Public Works Department.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's the same flawed argument that people <a href="http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1716/what-does-packing-heat-mean">packing heat</a> protect us from gun nuts. It assumes people shooting/urinating are in a right state of mind, and can understand consequences.</p>

<p>I'd be more interested in a corruption repellent. If a white collar criminal or government official steals money, the electrons used in the transaction (amplied for effect) bounce off their monitors and give them a shock.</p>
