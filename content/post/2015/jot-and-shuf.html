<p>Sounds like the name of a hipster microbrewary. Welcome to <em>Jot and Shuff</em>; we don't have a menu and our floors haven't been swept in a week, but we have terrible music. Enjoy!</p>

<p>There are dozens of ways to generate random numbers on *nix systems, for cryptograpic or other uses. Sometimes, you just want a simple integer between a certain range for use in a script.</p>

<p>The BSDs have long had the jot command, which can be employed for this task. For example, to return a random integer between 5 and 100:</p>

<pre>
% jot -r 1 5 100
</pre>

<p>The BSDs come with jot, because they're awesome. Linux users can install athena-jot.</p>

<p>Today though I also learned GNU shuf can be used for the same task on Linux and Solaris 11.</p>

<pre>
$ shuf -n 1 -i 5-100
</pre>

<p>For absolutely no reason whatsoever, have this string of numbers that shuf generated.</p>

<pre>
34 74 86 22 95 14 78 4
</pre>
