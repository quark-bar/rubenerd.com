<p>I maintain a weekly list of current tasks in text files for work and personal projects. I used the week of the month for filename previously (such as 2015-09-01), before I realised I could employ another unique value: the week number of the year.</p>

<p>But how does one find it? It’s not on most calendars, and I certainly don't track them in my real life. Fortunately, *nix date to the rescue:</p>

<pre>
$ date +"%Y"
</pre>

Or randomly from my university Oracle notes, if that’s your thing:

<pre>
SELECT to_char(sysdate, 'IW') FROM DUAL 
</pre>

<p>For those curious, we're in week 36.</p>
