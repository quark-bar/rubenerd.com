<p>Despite their predictable moderation issues, I still find myself on the Stack Exchange network daily. In the process, I often notice interesting questions from other sites on the network, <a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1376016/the-word-integral-in-calculus-unrelated-to-integral-integer-in-algebra">including this one</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The word “integral” in calculus unrelated to “integral” / “integer” in algebra?</p>

<p>I think that the word integral in calculus is nothing to do with integer or integer numbers.</p>

<p>But why is integral is chosen for integration? In algebra, integral means related to integers, and this is exactly the same as the word integral in calculus with a very different (?) meaning; are they connected? If not why from millions of words are they same?</p>

<p>I remember asking the <em>same</em> question to my year 12 maths teacher, but she shrugged, and I forgot about it. Funny how seeing something years later can trigger all these memories!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They share a Latin root corresponding the the concept of 'wholeness'. In the context of integers, this would be interpreted as 'whole numbers' - i.e. numbers with no fractional part. In the context of integration, this would correspond to 'summing up to create a whole' in the sense of the integral representing a continuous sum or area. I think that's why they use similar words.</p>

<p>It's not often you learn about etymology from a mathematician, but that was the accepted answer. It seems plausible.</p>
