<p>I realised with all my exported posts in a directory, I can run some pointless stats. For example, these are the number of posts that start with the word “the”:</p>

<pre>
$ ls the* | wc -l
==&gt;     296
</pre>

<p>And that have the word “the” in it anywhere:</p>

<pre>
$ ls *the* | wc -l
==&gt;     791
</pre>

<p>And <em>K-On</em>:</p>

<pre>
$ ls *k-on* | wc -l
==&gt;     53
</pre>

<p>And that have the greatest name in the world in it:</p>

<pre>
$ ls *saskatchewan* | wc -l
ls: *saskatchewan*: No such file or directory
==&gt;     0
</pre>

<p>Hmm, clearly I have work to do.</p>
