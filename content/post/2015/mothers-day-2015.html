<p>To bring some awesomeness to your day, have this great photo of our mum Debra from my sister <a href="https://twitter.com/elkeee">@elkeee</a>. To all those who don't have their mums this Mothers Day, love and peace. ♡</p>

<p>During her chemotherapy, Debra had a ton of different wigs. She was a short–haired blond one day, and a long red–head the next. It caused no end of confusion for the security guards in our apartment building in Singapore, something she took great delight in :).</p>

<p>Pictured along with her was our then–brand new puppy Tigerlily. Her brother passed on last year, but Tiger is still getting up to mischief.</p>
