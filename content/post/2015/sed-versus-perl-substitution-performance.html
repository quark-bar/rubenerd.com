<p>Rubenerd is now generated with <a href="http://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. The performance difference over Jekyll is <em>stunning</em>, though it does take more post-processing to get things the way I want. One task is replacing certain blocks of exported text from each post.</p>

<p>This is the <code>sed</code> command run over all 4000+ posts:</pre>

<pre>sed -i '' -e 's/something/else/g' ${post}</pre>

<p>Note the empty string. BSD userland sed (FreeBSD, OS X, etc) requires this for inline replace. GNU sed in your Linux of choice does not.</p>

<p>Using <code>time</code>, I consistently get these numbers:</p>

<pre>
real	0m18.889s
user	0m8.388s
sys	0m10.470s
</pre>

<p>Not the end of the world, but still significant considering Hugo generates the entire site in only roughly double this time. So what could we do to improve this?</p>

<p>It's still my favourite language, so I tried a Perl substitution:</p>

<pre>perl -pe "s/something/else/g $POST &gt; ./TEMP</pre>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, a dynamic language writing to a temporary file didn't improve things:</p> 

<pre>
real	0m47.647s
user	0m19.730s
sys	0m20.112s
</pre>

<p>Needless to say, I'm seriously considering learning Go as my next hobby project.</p>
