<p>The number 209 is very important in <em><a href="http://theovernightscape.com/">The Overnightscape</a></em> universe. Frank explained when he first noticed it on episode “<a href="http://www.theovernightscape.com/archives/2495">1215: Glow Ron</a>”:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My first day in college, the 209 thing happened! September first, second, third or forth, of 1985
</blockquote>

<p>Wait a minute. I was born on the 27th of March, 1986.</p>

<pre>
$ irb
irb(main):001:0&gt; require 'time'
irb(main):002:0&gt; birthday = Date.parse("1986/03/27")
irb(main):003:0&gt; frank = Date.parse("1985/09/01")
irb(main):003:0&gt; puts birthday.mjd - frank.mjd
==&gt; 207
</pre>

<p>That’s not 209, but it’s pretty damned close.</p>
