<p><em>She’s The One</em> from Robbie Williams’s second album “I've Been Expecting You” is still <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVaRHJn_dgM">one of my favourites</a> of his. It sounds like the school hallways in 1999, with my Pentium MMX tower and Beanie Babies and the Borders in Wheelock Place.</p>

<p>I didn’t realise it was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She's_the_One_%28World_Party_song%29">cover</a>; the original song was by World Party. Last time I checked, that was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_World_Party">release</a> in the Worms games franchise.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic">Update: Vevo (in their infinite wisdom) don’t allow embedding on external sites. Have the nostalgic 1990s cover art instead, and click through to see. This wasn’t a problem in 1999.</p>
