<p>TreeHugger has published a haunting image series from 1940s Pittsburgh, in the US state of Pennsylvania. They're well worth a view, even if they're presented as a slideshow. <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/slideshows/environmental-policy/think-air-quality-regulations-dont-matter-look-pittsburgh-1940s/page/6/#slide-top">Slide six</a> included this intresting observation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The idea of increased costs for a necessity like heat during Pittsburgh's cold winters was surprisingly well-received. People were willing to pay for clean air, and the improved efficiency of clean-burning furnaces actually made the net cost of heat about the same as before."</p>

<p>This is very much like today. If really given the choice, people will pay for a healthier environment, and in the end, they'll often find that if you take into account externalities, costs are actually lower.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem, especially for libertarians and some conservatives, is recognising these externalities.</p>

<p>Australia went through this recenty with Tony Abbott repealing our carbon price. When it was in effect, pollution levels <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/24/australia-records-biggest-emissions-drop-in-a-decade-as-carbon-tax-kicks-in">dropped sharply</a> (despite the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lomborg.com/news/lomborg-op-ed-in-the-australian-carbon-tax-a-costly-feel-good-gesture-that-wont-reduce">embarrassingly wrong predictions</a> of the Murdoch press). Without having to factor the cost of their carbon dioxide output, pollution levels have <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/04/australia-carbon-idUSL3N0R51F320140904">unsurprisingly increased</a>.</p>

<p>As former PM <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2011/s3269932.htm">Paul Keating put it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look, only prices and markets shift these big things.</p>

<p>I mean, this is - the price allocates capital in the market. Only a price on carbon will start allocating capital to the right places, where we should be investing in the new Australian economy.</p>
</blockquote> 

<p>The same applies to individuals.</p>
