<p>I've been moving my <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">svn</a> and <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">hg</a> repos to git, to force personal familiarity with its <a href="https://gist.github.com/incompl/3819571">arcane syntax</a>. Installing the <a href="https://www.freshports.org/devel/git/">package</a> on a FreeBSD 10.1 box:</p>

<pre>
# pkg install git
</pre>

<p>... returns this package list.</p>

<pre>
New packages to be INSTALLED:
        git: 2.3.7
        expat: 2.1.0_2
        p5-Authen-SASL: 2.16_1
        perl5: 5.18.4_14
        p5-Digest-HMAC: 1.03_1
        p5-Net-SMTP-SSL: 1.02
        p5-IO-Socket-SSL: 2.012
        p5-Mozilla-CA: 20141217
        p5-Net-SSLeay: 1.68
        p5-Socket: 2.019
        p5-IO-Socket-IP: 0.37
        python27: 2.7.9_1
        libffi: 3.2.1
        p5-Error: 0.17023
        curl: 7.42.1
        ca_root_nss: 3.18.1
        cvsps: 2.1_1

The process will require 140 MiB more space.

<p><strong>Holy dependencies, Batman.</strong> And here I was thinking git was written in C (and wouldn't be written <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/57918">any other way</a>).</p>

<p>Fortunately, a quick search returned <a href="https://www.freshports.org/devel/git-lite/">git-lite</a>. In keeping with FreeBSD conventions, the generic named package is compiled with most of the expected includes, with -lite being the minimum required (vim-lite being one other that comes to mind).</p> 

<p>So we install...</p>

<pre>
# pkg install git-lite 
</pre>

<p>... with the following package list:</p>

<pre>
New packages to be INSTALLED:
        git-lite: 2.3.7
        expat: 2.1.0_2
        curl: 7.42.1
        ca_root_nss: 3.18.1

The process will require 21 MiB more space.
</pre>

<p>This has worked so far for work, personal, GitHub and BitBucket over SSH. As my imperial unit utilising friends are wont to say though, your mileage may vary.</p>
