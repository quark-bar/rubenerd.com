<p>The latest release of the (rather lovely, dare I say) nginx webserver comes with several useful fixes and security patches. This one in particular is most welcome:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Change: duplicate "http", "mail", and "stream" blocks are now disallowed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will make debugging and late night stupidity so much easier to fix. Thanks to the contribs :)</p>

<p>The update is available under nginx-devel in FreeBSD ports.</p>
