<p>Firefox has been getting flaky for me again, after several years of rock solid performance. On a whim, I switched to Safari as my default browser for a week. The results are below, listed by area.</p>

<h3>General browser</h3>

<ul>

<li><p>It’s fast, in every sense. It’s also true, it uses less battery power.</p></li>

<li><p>The narrow Address Bar in Yosemite is maddening, and you can never get it centred correctly again after you install extensions.</p></li>

<li><p>No vertical stacked tabs. How anyone can cram all their tabs into a horizontal bar (with barely readable titles) in 2015 blows my mind.</p></li>

<li><p>The bookmarks sidebar is inefficient. I can fit barely half the bookmarks vertically in it than I can in Firefox.</p></li>

<li><p>Firefox’s developer tools are getting better, but they’re still no match for Safari’s Web Inspector.</p></li>

<li><p>I didn’t realise how much I rely on favicons as visual indicators, now that I’ve lived without them in Safari now.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3>Extensions</h3>

<ul>

<li><p>No <a href="http://piro.sakura.ne.jp/xul/_treestyletab.html.en">Tree Style Tabs</a>. See comment about vertical stacked tabs and how critical they are.</p></li>

<li><p>No <a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">PrivacyBadger</a>, though the EFF has <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">never cared</a> about Safari.</li>

<li><p><a href="http://sweetpproductions.com/safaricookies/">Safari Cookies</a> is a solid cookie blacklist/whitelister, though the lack of a quick toolbar icon limits its utility.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="https://disconnect.me/">Disconnect</a> doesn’t provide a Safari extension on their website anymore, but their <a href="https://github.com/disconnectme/disconnect/tree/master/builds">Git repo</a> hosts an old version. Still seems to work.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://jsblocker.toggleable.com">JS Blocker</a> is a nifty extension for making 2015-era cruft pages usable and more private again, like NoScript on Firefox.</p></li>

<li><p>The DuckDuckGo extension isn’t really necessary, now that we can choose it as the default search and can use hashbangs to get anywhere else.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>As I have since Safari was first introduced, I used it briefly before moving back to Firefox (and <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/camino/">Camino</a> back in the day). Old habit die hard, and there are a still a few things that prevent Safari being my primary browser. The state of things are much better than last time I checked, though.</p>

<p>I'd also use SeaMonkey again as well, if it were for sidebar tabs. Maybe I do need to brush up on XUL after all.</p>
