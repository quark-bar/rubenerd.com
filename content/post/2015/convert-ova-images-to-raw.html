<p>Today I needed to convert an OVA to a raw disk for Xen. OVAs are original video animations that are usually released after a popular anime series, as well as being a bundle for Open Virtual Appliances.</p>

<p>OVAs are just tars, so you can extract them as such:</p>

<pre>
# tar xvf target.ova
</pre>

<p>From there, you can convert the resulting images to raw. I wrote <a href="https://rubenerd.com/converting-vmdk-version-3-images/">how to do for vmdks</a> exactly one year ago. Scary timing.</p>
