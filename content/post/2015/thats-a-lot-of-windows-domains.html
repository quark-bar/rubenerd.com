<p>For a Mac/*nix gentleman, I've been doing an awful lot of Windows stuff of late. Today was discovering why certain services don't operate with external firewalls and proxy servers.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-au/library/cc708605%28v=ws.10%29.aspx">this Technet article</a>, the following domains are required for successful Windows Updates:</p> 

<pre>
http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com
http://*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com
https://*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com
http://*.update.microsoft.com
https://*.update.microsoft.com
http://*.windowsupdate.com
http://download.windowsupdate.com
http://download.microsoft.com
http://*.download.windowsupdate.com
http://wustat.windows.com
http://ntservicepack.microsoft.com
</pre>

<p>And according to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/921471">this knowledgebase article</a>, these URLs are required to be bypassed if you're running a proxy server, otherwise Windows Activation will fail:</p>

<pre>
http://go.microsoft.com/
https://sls.microsoft.com/
https://sls.microsoft.com:443
http://crl.microsoft.com/pki/crl/products/MicrosoftRootAuthority.crl
http://crl.microsoft.com/pki/crl/products/MicrosoftProductSecureCommunications.crl
http://www.microsoft.com/pki/crl/products/MicrosoftProductSecureCommunications.crl
http://crl.microsoft.com/pki/crl/products/MicrosoftProductSecureServer.crl
http://www.microsoft.com/pki/crl/products/MicrosoftProductSecureServer.crl
https://activation.sls.microsoft.com
</pre>

<p>And finally, these URLs are required for your daily dose of nostalgially bad web design:</p>

<pre>
//rubenerd.com/
</pre>

<p>It reminds me of all the <a href="//rubenerd.com/owa-and-noscript/">domains I had to whitelist</a> in NoScript to access my student email in Outlook Web Access. As much as I dislike and not trust Google thesedays, I only needed <strong>one</strong> domain for Gmail to work back then.</p>

<p>And as an aside, this is the <a href="//rubenerd.com/thats-a-lot-of-unix-installs/">second post in 2015</a> to start with <em>"That's a lot of..."</em>. Make of that what you will. I wouldn't recommend overthinking it, or anything for that matter. I wonder if I can make ten? Sounds like a challenge :3.</p>
