<p>Merlin Mann made this great observation on the <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/207/">most recent episode</a>. I could certainty stand to get better at this; most of us could.</p>
<blockquote><p>If it makes you feel better to beat up yourself, and you become more productive because of that, enjoy the five or six years you have left to live.</p>
<p>But otherwise, <strong>knock it off</strong>. I have to remind myself five times a day; the time I spend feeling bad about what I’m not doing is not being used to create anything. It’s being destructive not creative.
