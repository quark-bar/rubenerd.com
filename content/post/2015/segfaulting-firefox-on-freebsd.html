<p>I tried to start Firefox on a fresh FreeBSD install, and nothing happened. Running it form xterm, I saw this:</p>

<pre>
process 0000: D-Bus library appears to be incorrectly set up; failed \
to read machine uuid: Failed to open "/etc/machine-id": No such file \
or directory
See the manual page for dbus-uuidgen to correct this issue.

Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</pre>

<p>I was about ready to write a bug report for dbus, before I realised I hadn't even started it. Derp!</p>

<p>To enable it in rc.conf and start:</p>

<pre>
# echo 'dbus_enable="YES"' &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.conf
# service dbus start
</pre>

<p>Otherwise:</p>

<pre>
# service dbus onestart
</pre>

<p>Now Firefox starts.</p>
