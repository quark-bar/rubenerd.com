<p>I'm just fine with my iPhone 5s and will likely be sticking with it for the foreseeable future. Staying a generation or two behind is much cheaper, and thesedays I'd rather spend the money travelling. I'm also grandfathered into a 1GB/$17 a month plan which by Australian standards is good.</p>

<p>For fun though, I checked out <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/iphone-6s-6s-plus-australian-pricing/">this ZDNet article</a> that lists all the major Austrlaian telcos and their iPhone 6s plans. With the current exchange rate, they're predictably expensive. Whatâ€™s worse is data:</p>

<ul>
<li>Testra: 1GB</li>
<li>Vodaphone: 1GB</li>
<li>Optus: 300MB</li>
<li>Virgin: 300MB</li>
</ul>

<p>SingTel back home offers 6GB for similar prices. 300MB in 2015 is an embarrassment.</p>
