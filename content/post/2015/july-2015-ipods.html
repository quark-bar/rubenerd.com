<p>Despite not owning a current one, or not using one for years, I have a real soft spot for iPods. I got my original slab of white gold on my 18th birthday, and a followup 5G iPod Video after reaching a university milestone in 2006. In a way, they've always felt like a <em>“life achievement unlock!”</em></p>

<p>These latest ones almost follow Apple's colour <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Tick-Tock">Tick Tock</a>. They tend to introduce shockingly bright, wonderful colours during one cycle, then they're muted for the next. It happened with the original iMacs, then onto their other product lines.</p>

<p>I say <em>almost</em> followed, because that pink is dazzling, and that blue is almost my favourite schade [sic].  And I want one.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I have no use for an iPod in 2015. My tiny computer phone handles my music and podcasts in a way these can't or shouldn't (to reach price points etc). But since when are my electronics purchases ever rational, especially when it comes to Apple?</p>

<p>Like that bookstore chain or low–patronage cafe you love, you wish they could live forever. But deep down inside, you know their days are numbered. I feel the same about the iPod, so any new release is a welcome reprieve from having to think about them disappearing, at least for another year or so.</p>
