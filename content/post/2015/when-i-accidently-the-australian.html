<p>Someone linked to an article about the #SydneyStorm on Twitter, which turned out to be from <em>The Australian</em>. For your delight, have these other articles linked to from the front page, with my comments in brackets.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rains embarrass doomsdayers</strong><br />
Chris Kenny – As city dams fill climate doomsdayers should be reminded of their predictions [of extreme weather?] and held to account.</p>

<p><strong>Baird should abolish the ICAC</strong><br />
Simon Breheny ICAC [Independent Commission Against Corruption] is adept at taking down [our side's] politicians over a bottle of wine, but incompetent at uncovering cases of serious corruption.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh Murdoch press, you so precious.</p>
