<p>After a bit of an <em><a href="http://theovernightscape.com/">Overnightscape</a></em> sabbatical, I've been listening to Frank Nora's podcast again. He was a defining voice of my late teens and early twenties, from my first full time job to my earliest years at university. It's like meeting with a dear friend I haven't seen for a while.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic">(I discussed this in more detail in <a href="//rubenerd.com/show275/">Rubenerd Show 275</a>).

<p>A few things have changed about <em>The Overnightscape</em>, most notably the inclusion of a regular Other Side segment where he blasts from the past, interspercing everything from 80s television commercials to current Creative Commons tunes. It's almost scary how our interests intersect.</p>

<p>Of note was <a href="https://soundcloud.com/thewhoha/who-ha-khaki">this glorious song</a>, which Frank featured on <a href="http://www.theovernightscape.com/archives/2352">episode #1177</a>. It's as though Tears for Fears started getting silly, then resumed recording songs in 2013 with all their 80s synth effects and drums.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You can call me khaki,<br />
Because those are the pants I wear...<br />
I don't mean to be rude,<br />
But I think you're mad.<br />
And looking real stupid tonight!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smooth jazz will forever be my <a href="http://tigerintherain.com/">first love</a>, but I also harbour a deep passion for 80s sound. It goes beyond simple nostalgia into something I can't quite explain. It moves me. I like to think it was because my dear late mum insisted on blasting the radio while I was being born, in 1986 naturally :').</p>

<p>This song captures that essential sound, with a silly sense of humour to boot. Now look at my pants! â™«</p>

<p><strong>Update 2019</strong>: The original audio is gone, so I've linked to it on YouTube instead.</p>
