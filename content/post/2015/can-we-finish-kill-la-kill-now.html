<p>Clara and I are finally forcing ourselves to finish <em>Kill la Kill</em>, the 2014 breakout anime from the Gainax spinoff Trigger studios. We’re down to the last few episodes, and boy it’s a slog.</p>
<p>Much like <em><a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/gurren-lagann/">Gurren Lagann</a></em>, <em>Kill la Kill</em> wove quite the universe and premise. We immediately empathised with the characters, and wanted them out of their seemingly intractable situation. Mako, her wonderful family and her <em>Hallelujah!</em> moments are especially delightful and heart warming.</p>
<p>Then, the second act/arc/half came around, and the story has devolved into a mindless parade of explosions and long–winded bluster. To each their own, but I’m finding it duller than watching grass dry. Look at that, it’s making me mix metaphors.</p>
<p>Our friends tell us the ending twist makes it worth the wait, but for now I can tell you I’m close to dropping this series again with three more episodes to go. It’d be a shame, because I otherwise love the characters. Someone give me strength!</p>
