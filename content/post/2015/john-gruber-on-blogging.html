<p>Regarding Andrew Sullivan’s <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/01/30/sullivan">blogging retirement</a>, emphasis added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve mentioned before that my mom’s father was a coal miner. That was his career. He spent like 40 years going into dark dangerous coal mines to perform grueling manual labor every workday, and wound up dying of black lung disease. <strong><em>Blogging isn’t hard work in the way that coal mining is</em></strong>, but above all else it demands enthusiasm.</p></blockquote>
<p>Humility is hard.</p>
