<p>As <a href="https://rubenerd.com/">mentioned</a> last week, <a href="https://vandyke.com/products/securecrt/index.html">SecureCRT’s</a> Session Manager is one of my new favourite things. Being able to access all the hosts I manage in one hierarchical sidebar has improved my quality of life more than I care to admit. About all it can't do is define RDP hosts.</p>

<p>Or... can it? If you use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id715768417?mt=12">Microsoft Remote Desktop</a> app, you can export a host definition, then launch it from a local shell connection from SecureCRT. It’s a hack, but it works!</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Open Microsoft Remote Desktop on the Mac. Choose a host, then go <em>File/Export</em>. Save the resulting file somewhere memorable.</p></li>

<li><p>Choose <em>Create New Session</em> in SecureCRT, and name it the same as your Microsoft Remote Desktop host.</p></li>

<li><p>Under <em>Connection/Protocol</em>, choose <em>Local Shell</em>.</p></li>

<li><p>Under <em>Terminal</em>, check <em>Close on disconnect</em>. We don't want the empty tab sticking around when we launch RDP.

<li><p>Under <em>Logon Actions</em>, click <em>Add...</em> and add the following (or equivalent) to <em>Send</em>:</p></li>

</ol>

<pre>
open ~/Documents/RDP/Host.rdp &amp;&amp; exit
</pre>

<p>Now I have RDP, SSH, telnet and serial consoles for all the hosts I maintain in the one place. Living the dream, people.</p>
