<p>I've revised <em>Rub√©nerd Show</em> licencing. New episodes will be released under Creative Commons Attribution, and only with Share-Alike if included audio mandates it.</p>

<p>I already eschewed (geshundheit) the <em>No-Derivatives</em> and <em>No-Commercial</em> clauses, because I want people playing my show on theirs, and even if they run ads. <em>Share-Alike</em> imposes similar practical limits, which I don't think are useful for audio. I want people spreading the show!</p> 

<p style="font-style:italic">(It's also in line with my preference for the BSD/MIT licences to the GPL, but that's for another philosophical discussion; along with Vim and FreeBSD being superior to Emacs and [GNU/]Linux).</p>

<p>Attribution is nice and simple. Feel free to take my audio and use as you see fit, provided you reference the show. Done and done :).</p>
