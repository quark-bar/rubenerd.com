<p>This is probably of limited appeal, unless you live in Australia and are moving house. Now that I think of it, it's also unlikely to age well! Be that as it <del>may</del> June, here are the plans and companies I went with, and some personal experiences.</p>

<h2>Power</h2>

<p>I went with AGL in the past, but I decided to try <a href="http://www.powershop.com.au/">Powershop</a> this time. They're a Kiwi mob that promise renewable energy sources, and have a usage-tracking phone application.</p>

<p>After camping out by the powerâ€“meter cabinet (waiting for strata to open it so I could get a meter reading) they connected us. Unfortunately, they never contacted us to confirm the connection, leading us to wonder whether power was still on from the previous tenant or not. A friendly support ticket later confirmed this.</p>

<h2>Gas</h2>

<p>We have a proper gas stove, which is really wonderful. It's also the first time I've had one since moving back to Australia, so I wasn't sure which provider to go with. I ended up with <a href="http://www.originenergy.com.au/for-home/electricity-and-gas/plans/green-energy.html">Origin</a>, in part because their eSaver plan seemed competitive, and I didn't need paper bills anyway. They also offer a "Green Gas" plan, which is carbon-offset.</p>

<p>Same as with Powershop, they connected us but we got no confirmation. A letter in the mail a few days after the scheduled date confirmed it.</p>

<h2>Internet</h2>

<p>This apartment has NBN access, which I count myself lucky to have. I transferred my ancient TPG account over from the ADSL2+ plan in Hornsby to here. TPG have been... challenging in the past, but seem to have got their act together of late. They also have significant infrastructure after a string of aquisitions. My mobile plan has also been grandfathered, which would easily cost double if I moved.</p>

<p>They connected us, sent a confirmation email, but I'm still only getting self-assigned IPs from the NBN box. Judging from other Whirlpool threads, its likely the NBN box isn't authenticating. Here's hoping this gets sorted out soon.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>So there you have it. Interesting how gas (ancient), electricity (last hundred years) and fibre optic internet (recent) are just considered basic utilities together. I wonder what else we'll be having delivered to our houses in the future?</p>

<p>As a disclaimer, if you think I'm a sucker for wanting carbon offsets, renewable energy, or for going with brand X, have fun with that.</p>
