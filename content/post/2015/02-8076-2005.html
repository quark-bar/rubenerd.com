<p>I keep getting phone calls from this number. I answer, and they hang up. Presumaly this is so you’ll call them back on your own <a href="https://rubenerd.com/i-could-pass-a-us-citizenship-test/">dime</a>, and so they can confirm your number exists.</p> 

<p>Different sites (such as <a href="http://www.reverseaustralia.com/lookup/0280762019/">Reverse Australia</a>) claim this is <em>Clear Life Insurance</em> trying to sell you stuff, though they initially claim to be from Bupa. They then ask for personal information, which if they were Bupa they’d have on file.</p>

<p>I’m adding this to my blocked number list.</p>
