<p>Yeah, I know, <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-questions/2004-March/040694.html">top posting</a>.</p>

<p>For those of us without a choice, Thunderbird and SeaMonkey let us top post above an original email, but it will still append your signature to the bottom. I dislike this, because it looks rude. If your signature contains your thanks and salutations, chances are people won't see it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we can change it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Account Settings</li>
<li>Choose your email account from the sidebar</li>
<li>Choose Composition &amp; Addre... (truncation is bad because it...)</li>
<li>Choose "below my reply (above the quote) from "place my signature"</li>
</ol>

<p>The great thing is this can be defined for different accounts. For example, my newsgroup accounts use bottom posting with signatures in the right place.</p>
