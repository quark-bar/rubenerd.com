<p>The title is from this <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/mobiles/iphone-6s-and-6s-plus-queue-20150924-gjukx1.html">Sydney Morning Herald article</a>.</p>

<p>The new iPhone is out, which means two things. One, there are people lining up to get one. Two, trolls revel in calling them out out, using some variation of “sheeple” or whatver insipid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau">portmanteau</a> they get off on now.</p>

<p>They’re predictable comments. It’s fascinating how lining up for a concert or sportsball match is kosher, but a technology fan queuing for a gadget is a target for ridicule. Fortunately, they don’t care/need your approval.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic">(Though I do get a bit of satisfaction seeing people waste their time talking about how people are wasting their time, seemingly oblivious to the irony of their comments).</p>

<p>I say this as someone who's never queued for a phone.</p>
