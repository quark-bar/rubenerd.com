<p>I hadn’t posted a music video for at <a title="Dat Cosby Sweater" href="//rubenerd.com/dat-cosby-sweater/">least a week</a>, and that’s apparently something I do now. So have this AKB48 song that looks as though <a href="//rubenerd.com/ponponpon-kyary-pamyu-pamyu/">Kyary</a> was in charge of directing and costumes!</p>

<p>It came out last year, and was the ED for <em>Wreck it Ralph</em>. Still, I had never seen it until <a href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> showed it to me over the weekend.</p>
