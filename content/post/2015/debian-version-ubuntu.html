<p>On Debian, the <code>debian_version</code> shows the recipe for a pretty amazing cinnamon banana smoothie. On Ubuntu, it shows the Debian release the current release of Ubuntu was based on.</p>

<p>For example on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS:</p>

<pre>
$ cat /etc/debian_version
==&gt; jessie/sid
</pre>

<p>I raise this, because at work we were attempting to detect the OS and version based on this file. Suffice to say, for this end you're better using lsb_release.</a>

<pre>
$ lsb_release -d
==&gt; Description: Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS
</pre>
