<p>On a classic <em>Simpsons</em> episode, Homer was dismayed to discover the reception for his <em>Everything Is Okay!</em> alarm was less than favourable. It seems people don’t like being loudly shouted at unless one has something urgent and important (not the same) to attend to.</p>

<p>This isn’t about iOS notification spam this time however, it’s the otherwise excellent <a href="http://www.sogo.nu/downloads/frontends.html">Inverse SOGo Connector</a> plugin for Thunderbird. With it, you can sync your contacts with third party DAV services, such as Fastmail.</p>

<p>Set it to perform periodic sync however, and you'll be notified every fifteen minutes of every operation, even if it didn't do anything.</p>

<p>These popups have no reason to exist. Fortunately, these can be disabled. In the address book, right click your synced account, click Properties, and tick "Notify only if data syncronised".</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> They persist even with this setting checked, darn. Untick <em>all</em> notifications, and you’ll be fine. Realistically, unless you're a socialite or in high pressure sales and are constantly getting new contacts, you won't need these notifications anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Update Again:</strong> I knew I remembered the name Sogo from somewhere; they’re a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sogo">Japanese department store chain</a> that had a branch in The Paragon in Singapore when I was growing up. It’s a Metro, now.</p>
