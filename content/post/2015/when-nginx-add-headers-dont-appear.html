<p>A project I'm working on requires the addition of custom http headers. As with so much of nginx's (refreshingly simple) syntax, this is trivial to achieve with the <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/NginxHttpHeadersMoreModule">NginxHttpHeadersMoreModule</a>:</p>

<pre>
http {
  add_header X-Backend-Server 'Windows for Workgroups 3.11';
  add_header X-Content-Type-Options 'nosniff';
}
</pre>

<p>Problem was, I'd reboot nginx as below, then even tried restarting, but the headers wouldn't appear.</p>

<pre>
# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nginx reload
# /usr/local/etc/rc.d/nginx restart
</pre>

<p>The first thing to check is whether our nginx has the aforementioned module. If a test of our configs returns clean with the above directives, we do.</p>

<pre>
# nginx -t
</pre>

<p>Despite the configs being reported clean, the headers <strong><em>still</em></strong> didn't appear. I was about ready to start hitting my own head–er against the wall–er.</p>

<p>Not to get all Malcolm Gladwell on you again, but <strong><em>turns out</em></strong> nginx only processes the deepest directives. Because I'd defined a header in a lower block, the higher ones weren't appearing. An example illustrates this:</p>

<pre>
http { 
  add_header X-Wont-Appear 'sadface';
  server {
    add_header X-Will-Appear 'yay!';
  }
}
</pre>

<p>I heard you like logic errors, so I put a directive in your directive so the original is discarded. It would be useful if nginx reported this; maybe <a href="http://nginx.com/products/">NGINX Plus</a> does ;).</p>
