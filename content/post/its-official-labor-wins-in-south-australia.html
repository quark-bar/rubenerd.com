<p>It seems now Labor has won the state election just a few minutes ago! I voted for The Greens 1 and Labor 2, so this result is fantastic. Another Liberal free four years!</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the news according to the South Australian ABC website:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Labor returned in SA</h2>
<p><em>Saturday, 18 March 2006. 21:18 (AEDT)</em></p>
<p>Labor has been returned in South Australia with a resounding victory for the Rann Government in today&#39;s state election.</p>
<p>With 60 per cent of the vote counted, the Labor Party has won more than 46 per cent of the vote, which represents a swing of 10 per cent.</p>
<p>The ABC election computer is predicting the party will win 30 seats, meaning the Government of Mike Rann will govern in its own right.</p>
<p>The Liberals have suffered a swing against the party of more than 6 per cent and are likely to win just 14 seats.</p>
<p>The Democrats have also suffered a 4 per cent swing against the party, but Family First have won almost 6 per cent of the vote which represents a swing of more than 3 per cent.</p></blockquote>
