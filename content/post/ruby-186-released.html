<p>My new favourite programming/scripting language (not least because it sounds just like my name ;) ) has been bumped up to version 1.8.6.</p>
<p>A shameless blockquote from <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">http://www.ruby-lang.org/</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ruby 1.8.6 has been released. (announced on <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-list/43267">[ruby-list:43267]</a>)</p>
<p>The source is available under three formats.</p>
<p>For a brief list of user visible changes and a full list of all changes since 1.8.5, see the bundled files named NEWS and ChangeLog, which are also available at the following locations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/tags/v1_8_6/NEWS">http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/tags/v1_8_6/NEWS</a></li>
<li><a href="http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/tags/v1_8_6/ChangeLog">http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/tags/v1_8_6/ChangeLog</a></li>
</ul>
<p>After this announcement, we will start the development for 1.8.7 as well as maintaining the &#8220;ruby_1_8_6&#8243; branch on which only critical bugs and security vulnerabilities found in the 1.8.6 release are fixed, and patch releases will follow on appropriate and timely occasions.  Please check them out after upgrading Ruby to 1.8.6.</p>

<p>I&#39;m implementing the next incarnation of the Rubenerd Show/Blog entirely in Ruby and am having a ton of fun doing it! Coming from a Perl background I feel right at home with Ruby&#39;s string pattern matching features and a large portion of the syntax, but at the same time it looks nicer and the OOP features are so easy to use.</p>
<p>I&#39;m doing work mostly in <a href="http://www.mod_ruby.org/">mod_ruby</a> because I&#39;m a control freak, but perhaps I&#39;ll give <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> a go soon too.</p>
