<p>I&#39;m typing this post with a sense of dissapointment and frustration which is never a good mindset to talk rationally about a subject, but in this case I feel it&#39;s nessisary to plow ahead.</p>
<p>I have now sent <strong><em>FIVE</em></strong> emails to <a href="http://ourmedia.org/user/38566">Ourmedia</a> over this last fortnight and I haven&#39;t got anything back at all, not even boilerplate.</p>
<p>For those not aware what&#39;s going on, Ourmedia is an <a href="http://archive.org/">Internet Archive</a> backed media hosting site which for some reason several weeks ago stopped letting me log in or even display my member page. Curiously my <a href="http://ourmedia.org/user/38566/blog">Ourmedia blog</a> and <a href="http://ourmedia.org/user/38566/links">Ourmedia links</a> pages are all still there, and if you browse the Internet Archives you can see all my content. As far as Ourmedia goes though, it&#39;s as if I&#39;m half dead, half not. They think I&#39;m the living dead.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> Does Ourmedia think I’m a vampire?</p></blockquote>
<p>Given I&#39;m moving webhosts because my current one is going under, I was really desperate to get my Rubenerd Show podcast episodes over to their site, and I still am. I also really want to start recording new ones again sometime soon!</p>
<p>It&#39;s a crying shame given Ourmedia is non profit (I&#39;m not going to put my audio material on a commercial site), has a great community, is specifically designed for a remix <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> culture and I&#39;m a huge fan of <a href="http://socialmedia.biz/">JD Lasica</a> (the founder)… but I&#39;m starting to think the support guys are just ignoring me.</p>
<p>Given this situation I may have no choice but to eliminate the middle man and start hosting files on the Internet Archives directly instead. As I said above I don&#39;t want to miss out on the community and my friends on Ourmedia, but I&#39;m left with no other options.</p>
<p>In the meantime Ourmedia folks, if you&#39;d be able to check my account, see why it&#39;s innaccessible and fix it, I&#39;d love to come back. Unfortunately I don&#39;t think I can wait much longer.</p>
