<p>Kevin is furthest on the right, I&#39;m the weird one second last from right!</em></p>
<p>My buddy Kevin Keirle is doing a fundraising thing. If you have a credit card and you haven&#39;t maxed it out (yes Hotaru I&#39;m talking to you! Man I miss you :oops: :sad: ) then consider helping out, its for men&#39;s health… no <em>not the magazine</em>, the actual thing. It&#39;s like me asking you to help out the world of PCs without actually anything to do with <em>PC World magazine</em>. Ah screw it. BeyondBlue is a really good organisation to support too, they really helped me when I lived in Adelaide.</p>
<p>Kevin, and your karma will thank you. Maybe you&#39;ll even get a body massage. Because he&#39;s a computer. Insider joke ;).</p>
<blockquote><p>Hey guys</p>
<p>I just signed up as a Mo Bro for movember, now i know your all mostly poor student types who cant spare any money since youve already racked up a tonne of debt on your already mounting pile of credit cards. Although if you can manage to spare a few dollars to sponsor me an my dirty stretch of lip hair then i’d be stoked, i’m sure you may even know a rich silly bugger who when drunk will be willing to donate even more.</p>
<p>Just incase you wanted to know, Movember is raising money for mens health, making donations paticularly to the prostate foundations of New Zealand and Australia (need i say more), and to the beyondblue campaign, trying to remedy a serious problem which you will all at one point see in a friend or experience yourself, DEPRESSION.</p>
<p>Anyway like i said i’d be over the moon if you could sponsor me as a Mo bro or even join me in Singapore at the end of this month for the Movember party.</p>
<p>(the rest of this email is the generic sendout btw)</p>
<p>Help me change the face of men’s health by sponsoring my mo.</p>
<p>Please go to <a href="http://www.movember.com/sg/sponsor">http://www.movember.com/sg/sponsor</a>, enter my Rego number which is 31281 and your credit card details.</p>
<p>The money raised by Movember will be used to change the face of men’s health by creating awareness and funding research into prostate cancer and male depression.</p>
<p>Movember culminates at the end of the month at the Singapore Gala Partè where I’ll be parading my Mo on the cat walk for a chance to be crowned the Man of Movember. If you want to be part of this great night you’ll have to purchase a Gala Parte ticket for AUD$10.00.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Kevin</p>
