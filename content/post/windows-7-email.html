<p>Got an email from Microsoft this afternoon. Yes I am aware the release candidate for Windows 7 wasn&#39;t the final version, and yes I&#39;m aware it wasn&#39;t supposed to be used after a cut off date, but this is ridiculous.</p>

<blockquote><p>While most people who tested Windows 7 have now moved to the final version, some are still running the Release Candidate. If you haven’t moved yet, it’s time to replace the RC.</p>
<p>Starting on <strong>March 1, 2010</strong> your PC will begin shutting down every two hours. <strong>Your work will not be saved during the shutdown</strong>.</p>
<p>The Windows 7 RC will fully expire on June 1, 2010.</p></blockquote>
<p>The emphasis was added by them, not me.</p>
<p>Multiple versions, forcing people who bought machines with crippled introductory software versions to upgrade to a less crippled version, staggered shutdowns with deleted files, who else could get away with this stuff other than maybe SAP et al?</p>
<p>Fortunately the retail copy of Windows 7 I run in a VM for a few Windows applications I still need still lets me use the Classic interface. I still reckon Windows 95 was the closest Microsoft came to creating a pleasant, clean, usable interface, and kudos to them at least for letting me still use it over Aero.</p>
<p>As for stunts like this, it just shows what a company like Microsoft can get away with with so much cloud and a terms of service agreement they know virtually nobody reads.</p>
