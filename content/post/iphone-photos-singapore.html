<p>Since coming back to Singapore I&#39;ve been packing in a lot of errands, exploring and walking around so I haven&#39;t been blogging so much obviously. You can&#39;t leave this city for more than a few months without so much changing that you become completely disoriented!</p>

<p>Anyway in case you haven&#39;t been following me on <a href="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd/">Twitter, <a href="http://twitpic.com/photos/rubenerd">TwitPic</a> or <a href="http://gowalla.com/users/Rubenerd">Gowalla</a>, here are some crappy iPhone shots I took. When it&#39;s a weekday and less busy I&#39;ll be taking my Nikon D60 out again :).</p>
