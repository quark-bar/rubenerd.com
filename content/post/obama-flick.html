<p>I&#39;m not quite sure why I find images like this so heartening. Perhaps it&#39;s because he looks likeâ€¦ a real human being. And <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/">there are many more</a> where that came from.</p>
<p>The eerie thing is, no sooner had I viewed this picture on Flickr than The Scorpions <em>&quot;Wind of Change&quot;</em> started playing in iTunes. Synchronicity?</p>
