<p>This comes hot on the heels of a report by the illustrious Mr Brown that Channel NewsAsia in Singapore used the Japanese earthquake as an excuse to sell high value advertising (<a href="http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2011/03/japan-got-earthquake-quickly-book-your-cna-commercial-slots-now.html">Japan got earthquake, quickly book your CNA commercial slots NOW!</a>). I&#39;m sure all the proceeds will be donated, right? <code>&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</code></p>
<p>So-called <em>&quot;new media&quot;</em> is bad because it doesn&#39;t adhere to the journalistic and honourable standards of <em>&quot;old media&quot;</em>, you see.</p>
