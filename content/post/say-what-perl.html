<p>Unlike in other languages, Perl's default print function doesn't print newlines by default. This is often desirable, such as in this case:</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env perl

use strict;
use warnings;

print("Please enter your name: ");
my $name = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
</pre>

<p>The resulting prompt will have the user type their name on the same line.</p>

<pre>
Please enter your name: Tousaka Rin
</pre>

<p>In situations where you want a newline, you use the standard <code>\n</code>:</p>

<pre>
print("Zettai Ryouiki FTW\n");
print("Tousakaaaaaa!\n");
</pre>

<p>This was the subject of ridicule from my Ruby development friends in the past, so in 2010 I <a href="//rubenerd.com/puts-for-perl/">presented a function</a> that did the same thing. Recent Perl versions have an even shorter function name, with the say command. The following will print the same as the above:

<pre>
say("Zettai Ryouiki FTW");
say("Tousakaaaaaaa!")
</pre>

<p>You can use this in your scripts today by requiring at least Perl 5.10, or explicitly enabling the feature:</p>

<pre>
use 5.010;
use feature qw(say);
</pre>

<p>Done, and done.</p>
