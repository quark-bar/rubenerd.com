<p>Christmas has come early! Less than a week after reviewing my transition from Thunderbird and Firefox back to SeaMonkey, we&#39;ve had a <a href="http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/seamonkey2.6/#download">2.6 and 2.6.1 update</a>! :)</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/seamonkey2.6/#new">release notes</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for the HTML5 &#8220;context menu&#8221; feature (contextmenu attribute)</li>
<li>Added Print Preview support to Composer</li>
<li>Added update channel indication to About SeaMonkey page (about:)</li>
</ul>
<p>And under the &quot;Mozilla platform changes&quot; heading:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Type Inference, significantly improving JavaScript performance</li>
<li>Added support for querying Do Not Track status via JavaScript</li>
<li>Added support for font-stretch</li>
<li>Improved support for text-overflow</li>
<li>Improved standards support for HTML5, MathML, and CSS</li>
<li>Fixed several stability issues</li>
</ul>
<p>As MCBastos, Paul Bergsagel and I noted in the newsgroups, the a significant change has been an overall improvement in performance, not just in JavaScript, and especially on my venerable 2006 MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="http://www.seamonkey-project.org/about">SeaMonkey team</a> for the present! I know a few of the developers are German, perhaps they&#39;re keeping with the tradition of giving and unwrapping presents on Christmas Eve instead ^_^.</p>
<p>As for the fact I&#39;m unabashedly using a gigantic K-On picture with the SeaMonkey icon superimposed… um… Merry Christmas!</p>
