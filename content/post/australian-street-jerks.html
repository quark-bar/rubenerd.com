<p>So I was making my way home one evening when I was studying in Adelaide. I wasn&#39;t in a hurry because the train back to Mawson Lakes wasn&#39;t due for another 45 minutes, so I was walking at a casual speed. I had my laptop bag with various anime badges slung across my shoulder, and was listening to some Michael Franks and some light J-Pop to calm myself down from a long day.</p>
<p>As I was making my way through a shortcut towards North Terrace, I felt a heavy hand on my shoulder. Before I had time to react, I was spun wildly against my will with enough force to knock the wind out my lungs.</p>
<p>I was 19 at the time, and the man standing in front of me was in his mid 20s. I don&#39;t remember much about his face other than his piercing eyes, and the fact he had a black shirt on with some obscure band I&#39;d never heard of scrawled across it in grey writing. All he would have needed is an obvious scar across his face or a limb, and a black ute with rims parked next to him and he would have been a walking cliche!</p>
<p>Needless to say, realising the girl with long blond hair he&#39;d touched was actually a guy, my look of surprise was met with one of horror mixed with disgust. He made a loud &quot;OH!&quot; sound, then turned the other way and ran.</p>
<p>I stood there for what seemed like an hour, my mind still racing trying to figure out what I&#39;d just experienced. When I made it to the train station I realised the whole ordeal and my standing there couldn&#39;t have lasted for more than a few minutes. Racing through my mind the whole time were thoughts of how I&#39;d narrowly avoided something nasty. Had I been a girl, would I have been less lucky?</p>
<p>That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever made that experience public. Back then I was terrified, now I just wish I&#39;d have taken a picture of him so I could do a TinEye, found his Facebook page and got revenge on him Nerd Style.</p>
<p>All this came flooding back a few days ago, when I was walking home with a close friend from my new university in Sydney. Suffice to say, she was hugged against her will by strangers. I attempted to fend them off, but not before she&#39;d been made to feel vulnerable and scared.</p>
<p>My sister has told me plenty of tales of when guys have leered at her and her friends, and the number of times she&#39;s narrowly avoided confrontations.</p>
<p>Around the world and particularly in Australia, sexism and abuse are still rampant. If you don&#39;t believe me, chances are you&#39;ve never been the victim of it, or you&#39;re wilfully ignorant. I myself confess I had no idea how bad it was until I experienced it myself, and saw it happen to my sister and friends.</p>
<p>During my Long Hair Days, I was mistaken for a girl all the time, and no less than three times it got physical. I&#39;ve been whistled at many more times, by people who clearly need better glasses. Interestingly enough, I grew up in Singapore and only ever had problems when I came to Australia. Go figure.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#39;s my relatively petite build in proportion to my height, my hair, perhaps I have an effeminate swagger, who the fuck knows? I suppose the fact my favourite colour is purple and I have cute anime girls on my backpack may send mixed signals. Still, a person&#39;s gender or appearance shouldn&#39;t be an excuse for any behaviour. I suppose that was what those Slutwalks were all about.</p>
<p>Men are vulnerable to different kinds of sexism, but I think it helps to remind ourselves that our female friends and loved ones go through a different kind of hell on a regular basis. And again, I only know it because I&#39;ve been mistaken for one.</p>
