<p>The latest anime I&#39;m watching is REC, based on the manga by Hanamizawa Q-Tarou. It&#39;s a SHAFT production, directed by Ryotaro Nakamura (you can find out more through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rec_%28manga%29">Wikipedia</a>, the <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6008">Anime News Network</a> or the <a href="">official Japanese website</a>.)</p>
<p>What initially drew me to this series was its peculiar episode format: in the first (and current) series there are nine episodes, but unlike most other anime each episode is only <em>12 minutes long</em>. It&#39;s actually a very watch-able time, it&#39;s not too long for when you don&#39;t have much time and it keeps each episode interesting. I think many other serialised shows could benefit from being shrunk, I&#39;m sure you could have an episode of most Western television shows cut in half and still retain the necessary elements to keep the plot the same.</p>
<p>As with the timing of the episodes, the premise of the story also drew my interest; instead of being yet another series centred around a team of high school girls or evil robotic cyborgs (not that those in certain does are a bad thing mind… ahem) it shows the adventures of a young businessman who seems to be a dead end marketing job and a 20 year old aspiring seiyū (which is ironic in itself considering seiyū artists would be involved in the production of the anime itself) who idolises Audrey Hepburn. An interested premise!</p>
<p>I&#39;m watching the DVD release with English subtitles. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an English dub available, and I don&#39;t care, I hate dubs! ;). Seeing as I&#39;m so early into the story I&#39;m not going to rate it just yet, but I can tell already that it could be in my top 5.</p>
<p>With this series I&#39;m going to be doing something I haven&#39;t done before; I&#39;m going to review each series as I watch it. Even if nobody else is interested at least it gives me a record of what&#39;s going on!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen Episode 1 already but it&#39;s almost 02:00am here and I should get to bed; I&#39;m going with my mum to the hospital for her chemo very early tomorrow. Actually… today, damn it!</p>
