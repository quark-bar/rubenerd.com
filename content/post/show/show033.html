<p>Guess who&#39;s back? Schady&#39;s back! Tell a friend! Yeah. Talking about the holidays and meeting up with family, meeting Prem Sankaran, Emily Young and Kevin Keirle in Singapore, having Hawker food (LOVE Kaya toast!) with Kevin Tan at 7 in the morning (also in Singapore!), moving to the warehouse and setting up The Office, the domain switch to rubenerdshow.com, the adventures with the now dead rubenerd.com and how Switchfusion is evil, my new 5.6 gigabyte webhost, how fed up I am with changing email addresses, and my gmail email and 49 free invites! Oh and a review of The Island.</p>
