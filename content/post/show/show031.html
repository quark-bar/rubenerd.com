<p class="show-description"><span class="show-duration" style="font-weight:bold">15:00</span> – My take on Seinfeld (WARNING: really bad), reviewing the Seinfeld DVDs, sand-boxing the new theme song, how freaky it is that I could be listening to this show 10 years from now (like talking to the future!), the big new revelation with iTunes with podcasting BUILT IN and what podcasting is if you&#39;re not sure what its all about, and my passport adventures and how a birth certificate is not a form of ID but merely as relevant as a slice of cheese… I don&#39;t understand either! Melbourne is Australia&#39;s evil city, and freaky credit card experiences in car parks.</p>
