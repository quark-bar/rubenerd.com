<p class="show-description"><span class="show-duration" style="font-weight:bold">18:30</span> â€“ <a href="https://rubenerd.com/show/ruben/">Ruben</a> tries to do a completely ad-lib episode (with mixed results!), reviewing what happened in 2006 (with some glaring omissions!), <a href="http://blackanddecker.com/">vaccum cleaners</a> that suck, Saddam&#39;s hanging (why I think he should have got life instead, being turned into a martyr), the Western media, alternate universes, the new <a href="https://rubenerd.com/show/">Rubenerd Show</a> and <a href="https://rubenerd.com/show/blog/">Blog</a> rollout (now with more fibre!), and <em>Ruben hopelessly trying to sing Gwen Stefani!</em></p>
