<p class="show-description"><span class="show-duration" style="font-weight:bold">1:08:56</span> â€“ A bit more serious: discussing the reasons why I became an atheist from experiences in my early childhood to the present, including most recently my beautiful mummy&#39;s struggle with cancer and passing on.</p>

<p>Also briefly refuting some of the misconceptions about atheists including intolerance, arrogance, spirituality, materialism, wishful thinking, heaven, the celestial dictatorship and such.</p>

<p><strong>BONUS:</strong> A very quick, foolproof test you can use to see if someone who trashes evolution has actually studied it.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> This episode was not recorded to insult people, it&#39;s just an explanation for why personally I&#39;m atheist. If you are religious you may be offended, but please know that in my heart that it was not my intention.</p>

But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one.</em></div>
