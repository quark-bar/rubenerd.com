<p class="show-description"><span class="show-duration" style="font-weight:bold">15:53</span> â€“ <a href="http://www.southaustralia.com/Adelaide.aspx">From Adelaide</a>: On Saturday nights some young people go binge drinking at nightclubs. Ruben does the hardcore thing by releasing a ridiculous, disjointed, repetitive, mildly irritating podcast episode with little cohesion or rational thought. And some people say he&#39;s a loser, can you believe it? Including vintage audio from Not Only but Also!</p>

<p>This also serves as a crossover for <a href=https://rubenerd.com/unplugged/">Rubenerd Unplugged</a>, the cheap knockoff of the <a href="http://onsug.com/archives/category/rampler">Rampler</a> which is coming soon. This will be the only episode where Unplugged material is played here, unless someone uses an effective form of persuasion against Ruben such a gun, or grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
