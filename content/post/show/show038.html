<p class="show-description"><span class="show-duration" style="font-weight:bold">15:00</span> â€“ Very personal episode today! Talking about why I hate clubs, clubbing, getting drunk and other pointless endeavours, why I think they&#39;re crap and how its next to impossible to find other people who think the same; includes a couple of audio clips from my favourite podcast Crap and Stuff by Israel J. Brown taking about the exact same thing! If you like this episode, don&#39;t forget to check his podcast out too.</p>
