*The Overnightscape Central* is a fun weekly podcast hosted by the illustrious PQ Ribber. Hosts and listeners of *The Overnightscape Underground* participate in a topic each week, and you’re welcome to join.

> **03:02:51** – The always-fun Ruben Schade returns from a long absence to provide ideas about Sydney, Australia! The very humorous Chad Bowers has ideas that are worth remembering at the office water cooler! Frank Edward Nora gives us some insight into his fantastic world of ideas! PQ Ribber has some nifty musical ideas! Mike Boody battles with ideas! Doc Sleaze really has some great ideas that you don’t want to miss! Your handsome host Jimbo is floored by it all and provides his own ideas at the end of the show, inspired by Chad. And as always – the Week in Review!
