<p class="show-description"><span class="show-duration" style="font-weight:bold">1:23:03</span> â€“ Recounting childhood memories and obsessions from Melbourne, Ikea furniture, Lego, is <a href="http://starbucks.com.sg/">Starbucks</a> having a positive effect, my favourite coffee house closing, improved coffee quality, rant about public transport (are we better building new damned giant roads or new train lines?), general public&#39;s perception of security is wrong (YOU are the biggest security threat!), getting fascinating <a href="http://www.schneier.com/index.html">Bruce Schneier</a> books for my birthday, security companies screwing consumers, using a non-administrative account on Mac OS X, comparing building your own computer and open source software to hot rod builders, being a 1990&#39;s kid, running Windows software on <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Linux</a> and <a href="http://freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> with <a href="http://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>, why it&#39;s a great time to be alive, comparing open source software developers to independent musicians, thanks to <a href="http://www.wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Audio_magazines">Jim Kloss and Esther Golton</a> for the inspiration, sorry for the sacrilegious comparison!
