<p>Tribute to Frasier and how Channel 9 had three episodes back to back, awesome! Also talking about the <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/19933">Cover Art</a> plugin for <a href="http://apple.com.au/itunes">iTunes</a>, the infamous &quot;software too old&quot; error and software update freezing and screwing up my 3G iPod. Other stuff including lucid dreaming (dreaming and you know you&#39;re dreaming) and my virtual metropolis I&#39;ve been dreaming up since I was 10 (hence the skyline on my <a href="http://RubenerdShow.com">website!</a>), a 5 star review of <a href="http://coopers.com.au/home.php?flash=0">Coopers Dark Ale</a> from South Australia and buying &quot;Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy&quot; and &quot;The Terminal&quot; posters from Blockbuster. And why do Credit Unions call it &#39;Internet BANKING&#39;?</p>
