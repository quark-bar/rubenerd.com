<p>A shorter episode today because my flight to Singapore leaves in a few hours! Briefly talking about the trip, the Rubenerd Show Christmas &#39;unplugged&#39; episodes coming up from Singapore and Malaysia, an adventure at Subway and an Aussie-sung Christmas song. See you on Sunday.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;">(For some reason this episode has disappeared from the Internet Archive! Adding to my list of episodes to update).</p>
