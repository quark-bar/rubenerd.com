abstract: "25:32 — What started as a discussion regarding an ugly new concept car turned into pontifications about design, and anti-patterns in cars and websites. If overenginering is to make something intentionally more complicated for no benefit other than to ship product, why are we so compelled to do it? Or did I just answer my own question?"
