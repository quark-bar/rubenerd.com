<p>My holiday comeback special! Talking about the new schedule for The Rubenerd Show effective immediently, where I went on my trip with my family and a review of The Coffee Works in Cairns, land reclamation, a one year old TV recording from the now-dead &quot;Channel i&quot; and the phenomena of &quot;lost audio&quot;. Signed off with Magical Trevor.</p>
