<p>The Rubenerd Show now has a mixer board! Talking today about my new audio setup compared to my crappy old setup, a brief history of Old Time Radio star <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hancock">Tony Hancock</a> and a clip from his work on &#39;Educating Archie&#39;, a brief review of a new utility called the <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/assistance/HA011513581033.aspx">Microsoft Office 2003 Converter Pack</a> for people who are still using Microsoft Office (and legacy versions at that), my new groovy [crap] university student inspired sculpture I created myself, the French word for &#39;desk&#39; and an awesome website <a href="http://www.pdasmart.com/ipodpartscenter3g.htm">PDASmart</a> for old iPod upgrades and repair kits. Dedicated to my fabulous Mr Father Rainer Schade.</p>
