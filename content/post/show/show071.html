<p><strong>South Australian State Election Supplemental Episode.</strong></p>

<p>The results of the state election, the seat tally for the lower house and the complete speeches made by Rob Kerin of the <a href="http://www.sa.liberal.org.au/">Liberal Party</a> and the residing winner Mike Rann of the <a href="http://www.sa.alp.org.au/">Labor Party</a>. Includes my take on the results, why I am overjoyed that Labor has been re-elected, why I voted for The <a href="http://www.sa.greens.org.au/">Greens</a> 1, Labor 2 and Liberal 5, and my disgust with a few Liberal candidates&#39; attitudes.</p>
