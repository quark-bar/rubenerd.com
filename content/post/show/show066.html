<p>Introduced by my sister: the third episode from Malaysia, for the first day of 2006! Talking about the shocking change of logo for Intel and the trashing of the Pentium brand; also Ben Stiller, Zoolander, Micronesia, marketing talk and crap, and topping off with how angry I am with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> for deleting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Time_Radio">New Time Radio</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Overnightscape">Overnightscape</a> articles and how it conveniently side steps free speech. Oh and spyware, RAM and another crack at Windows! Apologies for some audio problems, I&#39;m away from home and the machine I&#39;m using is pretty unreliable!</p>
