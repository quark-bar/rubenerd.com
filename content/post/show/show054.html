<p class="show-description">Ruben gets nerdy discussing <a href="http://dragonflybsd.org">DragonFlyBSD</a> and why it&#39;s awesome, keeping track of what I&#39;m talking about using a PDA (being a podcaster and all!), funny signs on Caltex petrol pumps that don&#39;t make a lick of sense, our trip to Victor Harbour in March this year and running out of fuel, and a tasteless [but side splitting] weather report by Chopper. Plus I finish the show in a record 15 seconds, you have to hear it to believe it!</p>
