<p class="show-description">Special surprise coming up today, the first (unedited) episode of my room-mate&#39;s podcast, The Kevin Tan Show (still a working title)! Topics in his first show include trying to calibrate and set up a microphone, a review of Deception Point by Dan Brown (who is a pretty damned good author), what he thinks is crap, what he&#39;s doing on my show, and Farmer&#39;s Union Iced Coffee (hey, I&#39;ve been a good influence!). Special guest appearances by Kenny Rogers and Ruben Schade of The Rubenerd Show.</p>
