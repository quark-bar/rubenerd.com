<p>Episode 38 part 2! Following up on why I hate clubs with another clip from Crap and Stuff by Israel J. Brown; also talking about some website-housekeeping, and my adventures with phone companies (Optus and Vodafone). Includes at the end a bonus stupid, inappropriate but fun audio composition :).</p>
