date: "2017-07-29T12:27:29+10:00"
year: "2017"
abstract: '45:18 – With apologies to Michael Franks, we didn’t spend Christmas in Kyoto, but we did explore the hallowed grounds of the Kyoto Animation gift shop and studios (the greatest anime production house ever, obviously), then down to the market that inspired Tamako Market, the Imperial Palace, and an equally impressive convenience store. Other topics include railfans at JR crossings, cicadas, fog and monsoons, Disney, pretty anime boys, Yahoo and Infoseek, and getting lost at Kyoto station. Sounds from the Osaka-Kyoto Shinkansen, and the Kyoto Municipal Subway.'
