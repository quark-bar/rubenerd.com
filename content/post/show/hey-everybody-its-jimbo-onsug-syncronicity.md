*Hey Everybody It's Jimbo* was a delightfully offbeat podcast by Jimbo on *The Overnightscape Underground*. He asked me if he could feature an episode I'd done in this compilation, which I was happy to be a part of! *Update 2020:* Jimbo is no longer with us, so this episode is particularly special to me. Thanks for *All The Great Shows*.

> **54:56** – Jimbo broke his back making this episode (really he did; he is in a body cast right now as he sifts through the buffet line). A myriad of Onsuggers show up here and they all are talking about one thing: bizarre synchronicities that have happened to them. You’ll be shocked and amazed. Some may even soil and stain their pants. Carl Jung, pffft. We’ve got this covered: twenty one synchronicities to chew on.
