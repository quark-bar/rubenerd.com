abstract: '20:41 – The last Rubenerd Show for 2005, isn’t it… what’s the word I’m thinking for… a word like sentimental but less soppy. In any event, talking about my new year’s goals and why I have no resolutions (thank you Phil Gerbyshak), a review of the biggest year of my short life to date (what with starting uni, moving out of home and all) and what I hope to achieve in 2006. A time capsule episode so to speak, be interesting to listen to the same time next year. Have a fantastic new year!'
