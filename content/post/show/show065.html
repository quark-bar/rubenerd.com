<p class="show-description">The last Rubenerd Show for 2005, isn&#39;t it… what&#39;s the word I&#39;m thinking for… a word like sentimental but less soppy. In any event, talking about my new year&#39;s goals and why I have no resolutions (thank you <a href="http://makeitgreat.typepad.com/makeitgreat/2005/12/forget_resoluti.html">Phil Gerbyshak</a>), a review of the biggest year of my short life to date (what with starting uni, moving out of home and all) and what I hope to achieve in 2006. A time capsule episode so to speak, be interesting to listen to the same time next year. Have a fantastic new year!</p>
