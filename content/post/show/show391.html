title: "Rubenerd Show 391: The Lemon Grove episode"
date: "2019-03-16T17:28:41+11:00"
abstract: "01:12:50 — It's another Rubenerd Squish, where I stick a few unrelated episodes into one! Part one discusses the most bizarre advertisement I've ever seen, in an audio journey through a 1970s era shopping centre that has barely changed. Part two discusses fabric couches, fun with spirometry, the Clipboard Mafia, and certain frustrating podcast ads. Part three discusses duopolistic allegiances, and fun with reverb-berb-reverb. Recorded Feburuary-March 2019."
