date: "2019-06-29T21:57:10+10:00"
abstract: "51:02 — Join Ruben as he takes a somewhat narcissistic view of work, life in one’s thirties, mindfulness or lack thereof, charities, the events in Hong Kong, the ergonomic considerations behind corn chips, wandering around Artarmon thinking the same things, and a classic clip from Flight of the Conchords. You want to sit down but you sold you chair, so you... you just stand there. Recorded over a few weeks in June 2019."
