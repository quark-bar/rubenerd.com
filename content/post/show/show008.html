<p class="show-description">Announcing changes (as usual!) to the show, where the hell I&#39;ve been for 3 months, adventures with Netspace Australia internet access, podcast withdrawals, the fabulous UniSA student internet in student housing, the state of the entertainment industry and where podcasting fits into it all (an epiphany!), why uni timetables are deceptive, microphone woes and a review of Mac OS X Tiger.</p>
