abstract: "43:59 — Join Ruben in a soulful, bronchital state; a word that almost certainly doesn’t exist. Topics include Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, secret apartment doors, Apple keyboards really are that bad, stabbing myself in the eye with a poster, Australia’s obsessive coffee culture, Arashiyama in Kyoto, and accidental beverages. Break song by the delightful Good Mythical Morning gents who trained a predictive text bot."
