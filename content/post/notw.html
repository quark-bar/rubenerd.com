<p>According to Twitter folk, James Murdoch announced <code>01:50 AEST</code> that Sunday&#39;s edition of that sordid exploiter of human misery <em>News of the World</em> will be the last. </p>
<p>Provided they had any credibility to start with, <a href="http://rubenerd.com/news-limited/">News International</a> has lost it, and so potentially has <a href="http://www.crikey.com.au/2011/07/07/the-latest-24-hours-of-the-notw-phone-hacking-scandal/">David Cameron</a>; to say nothing of the lives of the innocent victims and their families who were used as pawns. These <em>&quot;journalists&quot;</em> and their managers are beneath contempt, and the only thing that angers me more is they won&#39;t get what they deserve.</p>
