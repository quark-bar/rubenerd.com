<p>If I were into paranormal stuff, Iâ€™d claim it was a syncronicity.</p>
<p><a href="http://cityrail.info/service_updates/service_interruptions/service_interruptions_detailed?lineId=nt">Today, in Sydney</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trains across most of the CityRail network are delayed up to 40 minutes after a fire safety alarm activated because of smoke in the Strathfield Signalling Complex earlier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/newton-mrt-fire-train-services-between-marina-bay-toa-payoh-resume-201">Today, in Singapore</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[a fire in an MRT tunnel] involving electrical wiring disrupted train services on the North-South line at about 9.05am. [..] Train services between Marina Bay and Toa Payoh stations resumed at 11.30am</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a fire alarm goes off, and the entire CityRail network goes down in Sydney for the rest of the day. A fire hits the Singapore MRT, and the affected line is fixed in less than 3 hours. Good to know.</p>
