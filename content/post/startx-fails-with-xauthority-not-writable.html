<p>I was trying to start xorg on my token Linux tower this afternoon, but it kept timing out with errors. Among the last lines of output:</p>

<pre>
xinit: server error
xauth: /home/R/.Xauthority not writable, changes will be ignored
</pre>

<p><em>Turns out</em>, I’d installed the packages with sudo from my home directory, then attempted to test X while still root. Therefore, the resulting Xauthority file was owned by root, so my regular user couldn't modify it. Derp.</p>

<pre>
-rw------- 1 root root 156 Jul 28 12:37 .Xauthority
</pre>

<p>I could have changed ownership, but I just deleted the file and ran startx again.</p>
