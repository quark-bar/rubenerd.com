I was cleaning out my ancient Google Docs account, and found a single file which I will share with you now.

> RUBEN'S JOURNAL  
> `2010.11.20` Sunday

Oh, that was it. I probably should have written more. It also kills me that I wasn't using [ISO 8601] dates back then. The order is correct, but it should really have been written as `2010-11-20`.

Which leads us to another series of *Rub√©nerd Directives*, this time about dates:

* `MM/DD/YYYY` makes no sequential or aesthetic sense whatsoever, and adds to confusion when globally-minded communicators read `01/01/2017`.

* `DD/MM/YYYY` is sorted, which is a start.

* If you don't use leading zeroes, you're a monster who probably truncates years and puppies, too.

* `YYYY-MM-DD` is optimal, for sorting and aesthetics. East Asian societies [long figured this order out].

You're free to disagree with any of the above points, just as I'm free to point out you're incorrect. Thank you.
