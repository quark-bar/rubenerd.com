I learned a new word today, [from Wikipedia]:

> Irredentism (from Italian irredento for "unredeemed") is any political or popular movement intended to reclaim and reoccupy an area that the movement's members consider "lost" or "unredeemed". These territorial claims are justified on the basis of real or imagined national and historic (an area formerly part of that state) or ethnic (an area inhabited by that nation or ethnic group) affiliations.

I thought it sounded like a denture cleaning apparatus. From the etymology section:

> A common way to express a claim to adjacent territories on the grounds of historical or ethnic association is by using the adjective "Greater" as a prefix to the country name. This conveys the image of national territory at its maximum conceivable extent with the country "proper" at its core. The use of "Greater" does not always convey an irredentistic meaning.

This was in the context of the [Korean reunification] article, which is listed in the [Irredentism navbox]. I still say it sounds dental: *Oral-B Irredentism, for that irredentistic smile.*
