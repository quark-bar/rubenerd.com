I did the whole [Solarised colour theme] thing for a few years, but (ironically) I never found the contrast great. So now I've gone old school and installed a Borland theme; it's nostalgic, clear, and convinced my colleagues that my machine had crashed.

[delip] was the original author, but I first found it through this [fabulous collection] of iTerm themes on Github. People take their colours seriously.
