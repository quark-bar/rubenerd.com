I've witnessed an explosion in the use of that alleged word that even rivals *nuance*. It needs to be stomped out, for two reasons:

1. If you live outside the US, **it's not a word**. If you're in the Commonwealth and use it, you may as well *customize* your other *colorful* spelling.

2. If you live in the US, **it's a lazy word**. It can always be substituted for something better, such as *"I was given a present by Ruben"* instead of *"have gotten a present from Ruben"*.

Glad to have <del>gotten</del> vanquished that from my system.
