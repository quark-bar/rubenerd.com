I didn't get time to do fanmail submissions last Friday, so I thought I'd quote this delightful piece we got at work recently. Everything about this message is wonderful.

> This is Mr.Fatmir from Daimler group World top enterprises  , 

I'm already considering a blog name change to *Rubenerd group World top super enterprises best in Singapore and JB and some say Batam.*

> From internet ,we know you are interest of our original brand of auto parts .

From INTERNET!? I hear they have that on computers now.

> We are top agent (general distributor) of 100 famous auto parts brands 
> such as Mercedes / Bmw / BBS / Toyota / Honda/ bearing FAG /Skf/ Ina
> Sachs ect..,see the list below. 

BBS cars! They're slower, but they're retro. Can I get a NOCHANGE BBS car so I can play games while I drive to oblivion?

> Our manufacturer base can also produce on your own b.r.a.n.d.

Are you s.u.r.e about that?

> If you are a salesperson or customer service, please transfer this 
> E-mails to your company purchaser , because competitive goods in low 
> rate can make your sells easier , 

And you know me, I'm all about the making sells easier. That paraphraph wasn't truncated, that's how the email ended.

Whoops, it seems to have somehow made it onto my public blog. I did consider the environment and avoided printing, and it did introduce Phua Chu Kang and Simpsons references together for possibly the first time.
