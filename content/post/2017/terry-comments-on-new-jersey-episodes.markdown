Speaking of my evil drafts folder, Frank Nora and I got this wonderful message from Terry late last year:

> What a treat! (it's Halloween season, get it?)
> 
> Just finished listening to the series of shows with Frank, Manny and 
> Denise as they show off parts of the NYC/NJ area to Ruben and Clara.

Terry is referring to [this Overnightscape episode](http://onsug.com/archives/21514). One of the most fun days of my life, am glad that came through in the audio.

I hadn't thought of that, but the geographic journey does add a whole other level. Now I want to create a map of this myself!

This would be wonderful! It does cost a lot though, and losing an entire day flying isn't any fun. Singapore or Japan would be a fun half-way point though I'm sure we could have fun and explore in.

Sounds good! Maybe a topic could be why Ruben always got The Dadaist Cabaret and The Escapist names confused, like elbows/shoulders, washing machines/dish washers, and some earlier New Time Radio programmes. I don't know why, they're **completely different** programmes, but I realise I even did it again when I replied to Terry.

Thanks!
