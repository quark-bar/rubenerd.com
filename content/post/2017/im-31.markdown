A pretty low-key birthday today, but that's [always been my style]. I was terrified about turning 30, but recent family adventures render me happy, relieved and feeling very fortunate for making it this far ^_^.

Here, have a figlet:

     _____ _
    |___ // |
      |_ \| |
     ___) | |
    |____/|_|


Or this one!

      ****   ** 
     */// * ***

       ***  /**

     *   /* /** 
    / ****  ****
     ////  //// 

As far as years go, my 30th on this planet was amazing. I met so many of my foreign friends in New York, Philly and New Jersey; made progress on several personal fronts; advanced in my career at a company with colleagues I'd consider friends. After so many years of veritable shit, I have much to be thankful for now.

I'm looking forward to next year, when I become fully 32bit compliant. This whole time I've been backporting binaries from future me, and recompiling them for my insufficient 16bit brain.
