[Speaking of the Mac Pro], HP's [Pavilion Wave] looked interesting when Clara and I were last wandering around JB-HiFi. In lieu of a shiny cyliner, the machine is enclosed in a rounded triangular prism made of fabric and plastic.

Unlike the Mac Pro, the Wave has a standard(ish) Mini-ITX motherboard, albeit stretched to include more inline ports. It also has no space for a discrete graphics card (or two), and only two memory slots.

In a way, it's a Mac Mini with a proper speaker and current parts, in the form factor of a Mac Pro. In light of Apple's comments that the Mac Pro's thermal limits thwarted upgrades, maybe this is the logical conclusion for this form factor.
