The MacVim maintainers continue to surprise me. If you do a search/replace the Vim way:

    %s/something/else/

Then hit `Command+F` out of Mac muscle memory, the search field shows your last searched term:

Generic Mac search boxes miss much of the Vim's search power, but in a pinch it can be a real time saver.
