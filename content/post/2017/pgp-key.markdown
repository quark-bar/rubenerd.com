I've regenerated a new PGP public key. Saying "regenerated" and "new" was somewhat superflous, much as this sentence is.

My new [signature]\:

    CF58 5ADD F755 143E E18E 73AA 9CFC 8AEB BD52 8543

Give [Mailvelope] or [WebPG] a try if you've never used PGP; it puts encrypted and signed email right in your webmail. Otherwise, I've used [Enigmail] in Thunderbird and SeaMonkey mail for years.
