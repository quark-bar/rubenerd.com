*[ElectroBOOM]* is the world's greatest YouTube Channel, [right behind mine] where I replaced the fan on my first generation MacBook Pro nine years ago. Don't watch that.

Mehdi Sadaghdar is hilarious, educational, and [FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER]. I'm a proud [Patreon subscriber], and you should be too.

For you Friday viewing pleasure, [have this earworm] that's been stuck in my head all day. Mission accomplished!
