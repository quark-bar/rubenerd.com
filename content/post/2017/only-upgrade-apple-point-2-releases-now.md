With this latest root exploit fun and [usability problems] on High Sierra, and the unstable mess of iOS 11, my decade-long advice to wait for the first `.1` release before upgrading no longer stands.

You know things are bad when your Linux boxes have fewer glitches! Which reminds me, I need to review the new post-Unity Ubuntu, which I won't be running because it's not an <abbr title="long term support release">LTS</abbr>, but I'm impressed with what they could do with stock GNOME. But I digress.

In the meantime, I've downgraded the one machine I updated to High Sierra back to Sierra, and am checking if KRACK was ever patched in iOS 10 so I can go back to that.

Which leads us to the ultimate conclusion: it totes [wouldn't have happened under Steve Jobs]; *cough* Snow Leopard!
