These last couple of weeks have been nothing short of shithouse, so I thought I'd assuage my melancholoy and fear with some classic Icehouse. Everything about this music video is **perfect**, right down to the mullets!

It's also fascinating seeing the 1980s Sydney skyline. It looks [so different] now.

For another classic Icehose tune, check out [what should really be our national anthem].
