Finding vintage computer hardware for sale online is challenging, but finding drivers is arguably just as difficult. The following tree based on my latest adventures updating my [vintage tower]. Bold text denotes a branch end.

* Search engine acknowledges driver exists
    * Search result is a forum
        * Forum post references Mediafire, Mega, etc
            * **Link not found, link removed**
        * Post links to internal site
            * Requires registration, probably invite only
                * **Attachment has been removed**
    * Search result is a scummy driver site
        * Requires registration
            * **Download adware**
    * Search result is legitimate download
        * **It's not for the OS claimed on the site**
        * **It's not for the hardware claimed on the site**
* Search engine doesn't have anything for that hardware
    * Decide to trawl eBay
        * **Long shot, but find driver CD or disk**
    * Ask social media if they know
        * **"Why do you want to run such old hardware?"**
        * **"Why not buy different hardware?"**
        * **"Your interest in retro computing is dumb lol"**
        * **"Um..."**
