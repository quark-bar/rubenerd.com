[I used Safari for a week in 2015], and commented:

> I didn’t realise how much I rely on favicons as visual indicators, now that I’ve lived without them in Safari now.

[I did another review earlier this year], in the context of being able to use Safari now that uBlock Origin was available. I still noted:

> The lack of favicons still make horizontal tabs difficult to differentiate.

John Gruber of Apple blogging fame has also [just done a followup] on an earlier Safari usability post, and was taken aback by the feature people missed the most:

> But really, taken as a whole, the response to my piece was about one thing and one thing only: the fact that Safari does not show favicons on tabs and Chrome does. There are a huge number of Daring Fireball readers who use Chrome because it shows favicons on tabs and would switch to Safari if it did.

He boils it down to two concerns:

> (1) there are some people who strongly prefer to see favicons in tabs even when they don’t have a ton of tabs open, simply because they prefer identifying tabs graphically rather than by the text of the page title

I use both, but agreed.

> and (2) for people who do have a ton of tabs open, favicons are the only way to identify tabs.

This especially. If we're not going to have stacked sidebar tabs which [other browsers] or [browser extensions] do, the very least we should have is another visual cue when they're squished down like this. I'd also vote for this in landscape mode on my dinner tray-sized iPhone 7+; there's certainly space for them!

Basically all I'm after is a 2017 Webkit [Camino], which incidently used favicons.
