I've spent much of this weekend working on a particularly thorny issue, and wanted to thank the following project maintainers for helping out in my hour of need:

* [Gparted's Live CD]: A lightweight, Debian-based distro with their legendary graphical partition editor, and other essential tools. I know my way around shell tools, but this makes it so much easier to visualise.

* [Super Grub2 Disk]: It can auto-detect and boot from OSs not shown in your Grub configs. Great for when you've hosed your aforementioned config, and need to remember what went where.

* [openSUSE], for their rescue CD.

* [Boom2]: Makes your music sound awesome, especially when dealing with complicated remote drive problems.

Next pay day, they'll be getting some donations.
