My 11-inch 2011 MacBook Air kicked the bucket a few months ago, which sucks given Apple doesn't sell this model anymore. It also had plenty of life left in it - or at least, I thought it did.

So I've been mulling its replacement. I used to carry a 2.5kg first gen MacBook Pro in a shoulder bag, but now my 1.58kg work 13" MacBook Pro feels opressively heavy. Logic would dictate then the new 960g MacBook, but could I stand the keyboard and single port?

A colleague in the US is an even bigger mechanical keyboard maniac than I am, and carries his small Topre kit with his laptop. Maybe that would make a fun, optional, somewhat silly, but very fun coffee shop alternative.
