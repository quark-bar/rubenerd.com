I wanted to give a shoutout and personal thanks to the Official Rubenerd Patron Sir Jerry Novak again for another caffeine-related donation. I'm drinking it as we speak!

I may be working from San Francisco for a couple of months later this year, I'm thinking a quick trip down to LA for a meetup may be in order :).
