macOS must have downloaded and installed the latest iTunes during the last software update. It's the [awful one] where they removed the mobile app store, without replacing it with a standalone program or anything. **#picardfacepalm**.

[Steve wouldn't have done it]!

The good news though, there's a **File Sharing** section now, where you can upload files to specific apps on the phone. A semblance of sanity prevailed.

Out of interest, the first iTunes I ran was on Mac OS 9 back in the day, but iTunes 7 was the [first to be reviewed] here. Looking at those screenshots from a decade ago reminds me how far we've come, or haven't come. Wow, that navigation looks so clean.

Now to wait for iOS 11.1.
