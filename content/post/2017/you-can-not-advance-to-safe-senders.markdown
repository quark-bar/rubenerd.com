This is my new favourite Outlook Web Access email experience!

1. Find an email from a colleague in "Junk E-Mail"
2. Open the email
3. Click "Not Junk"
4. Confirm you want to add your coleague to "Safe Senders"

You'll be told:

> The email address for the sender ([SENDER]) is internal to your organisation and cannot be added to the Safe Senders list. Email from senders in your organisation will never be treated as junk email.

I suppose **never** is more a guideline than an actual rule.
