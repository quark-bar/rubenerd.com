I created a new filter to send anything with the above line to spam. It's shocking how many it's caught.

Variants:

> "Did you get a chance to review ..."  
> "By chance, did you review..."  
> "Yo dawg, I heard you liked spam, so I followed up with my spam with more spam so you can..."

There must be a marketing playbook that says followup emails phrased in a specific way generate more leads, so it's natural for spammers to adopt it.
