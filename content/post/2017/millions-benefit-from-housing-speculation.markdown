Michael Janda [reported this in ABC Business]\:

> Real estate: Housing outlook moderate to grim, according to experts and property industry. Millions of Australians have profited from the mantra that house prices only ever go up. But is that shibboleth about to be demolished?

And millions of Australians have been greatly hurt by it, though it's not till the second last paragraph we get this throwaway line:

> Given that Australian housing remains among the least affordable in the world, according to Demographia's latest annual report, it would seem logical that the nation's booming markets must cool soon or face a bust.

A bubble burst would wreck havoc across the board, but an entire generation of Australians (priced permanently out of the market) could be forgiven for wanting to burn the whole place down and start again.
