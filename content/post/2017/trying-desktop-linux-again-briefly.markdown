Over the Christmas break, I thought it'd be fun to try dual-booting a  Linux distro on my purpose-built game machine. There were tons of reasons, but these were the primary ones:

* macOS is my preferred OS, but the direction of Apple hardware is becoming a farce. This game machine has better technical specs than any of my Macs, or any Mac for sale, so it makes sense to use it more than just a glorified Windows game console.

* Most of the software I use on my Macs is free/open source anyway, so the barrier to entry isn't too high. This originally stemmed from the unavailablity of x86 Macromedia Fireworks when I moved from my PowerMac G5, and realised The Gimp and Inkscape were perfectly usable.

* I'm a pigheaded fool who'd rather run his own web stack and tinker with an OS than just use Tumblr text posts and exclusively use macOS. Not enough to go the Hackintosh route mind, I'm not insane.

So I tried a bunch of Linux distributions, including openSUSE, Elementary, Fedora Cinnamon Spin, Debian Jessie, and vanilla Ubuntu. Each one mostly worked; I'll likely blog about them in the coming weeks.

While going through the process each time though, I couldn't get [this post from Marco Arment] out of my head:

> But then I (barely) graduated from college, got a full-time job, and lost the drive to keep screwing around with my OS. I just wanted to get things done in my precious few free hours, and fiddling with my setup began to feel like wasted time. This shift in my priorities is what has kept me so happily addicted to Apple products.

This didn't head the nail on the head, as much as it piledrove a foundaton for a skyscraper. I spent so much of my precious holiday installing these things, and to what end?

My 2012 MacBook Air connected through a KVM is a minnow compared to this desktop, but it does what I need far better. It's relieving in a way that I don't have to maintain another machine, but I sure as hell Apple get their hardware act together.
