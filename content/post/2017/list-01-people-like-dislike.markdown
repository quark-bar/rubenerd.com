I wasn't [stuck] between the moon and New York City this week, but I **was** stuck on the tarmac at Sydney Airport for half an hour. Sorry [Russel Brand], you were no [Dudley Moore].

So I made two pointless, unordered, and incomplete lists. Enjoy.


### Dislike

* People who cut off ambulances
* People who ask for an "expresso"
* People claiming moral authority who aren't
* People who are on this list
* People who label a "vegetable pie" with beef in it


### Like

* People working in climate science in 2017
* People tirelessly maintaining old Exchange servers
* People who smile when they walk past
* People who are on this list
* Artichoke farmers
