The IBM keyboard manufacturer sent out a customer survey today. These were my answers:

> **Please use this free-text space to inform us what we should 'START' doing......**  
>> Hi guys! If you made the IBM M4-1 / "Mighty Mouse" again, and a TenKeyLess option (like an IBM SpaceSaver), I and all my colleagues would fill the office with them!

> **Please use this free-text space to inform us what we should 'CONTINUE' doing......**
>> Your customer service is friendly responsive and fast, even for weirder requests like pre-2013 keyboard sets!

> **Please use this free-text space to inform us what we should 'STOP' doing......**
>> Tantalising us with a TenKeyLess option from a couple of years ago and not releasing. We all understand and appreciate when things don't go to plan or schedule, so even a progress update would be appreciated. Cheers!
