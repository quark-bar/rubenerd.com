Welcome to 2017! Here's hoping it's a better one for the world... though, selfishly, mine was pretty good.

I thought I'd start this year with a fun comparison. A few posts ago I [shared a photo] of the Acela Express Clara and I took from Philadelphia to Penn Station, New York. For those with short memories, or better things to remember, here it was:

Here's the same consist in the Northeast Corridor route in the original *Microsoft Train Simulator* from 2001:

And the same consist again in the new [Northeast Corridor] route in *Train Simulator 2017*, taken this morning:

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2017/acela-ts2017.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2017/acela-ts2017.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2017/acela-ts2017@2x.jpg 2x" style="width:500px; height:312px;" /></p>

I love how realistic the Philly skyline looks in this, right down to the [Comcast Centre]! Friggen awesome.

Unfortunately, this just makes Clara and I want to go back.
