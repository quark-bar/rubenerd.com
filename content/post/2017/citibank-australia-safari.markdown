I got this alert when signing in:

> We noticed that you are using a non-Citi certified browser. For the best Citi Online experience, it is recommended that you use a [certified browser].

I was using the latest version of Safari, version 10.1.1. So I checked the linked page, emphasis added:

> You are recommended to use supported and **updated browsers** to ensure that your internet banking is secure.

Solid advice. What versions are supported?

> Safari 7.0  
> Safari 8.0

Most firms I'd give the benefit of the doubt, but poor showing for a company this size, folks!

I last mentioned Citibank in 2008, for some [sneaky advertising].
