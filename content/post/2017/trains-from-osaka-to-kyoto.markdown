There are a few ways that Clara and I either accidentally discovered or intentionally researched while commuting around Kansai. This information was valid when written in July 2017, but may have changed since.

### The Shinkansen

Japan's famed bullet trains are fast, smooth, and cray comfortable. They can get you from Shin-Osaka to Kyoto in 19 minutes. 

Every tourist guidebook, website and friend will tell you its a waste of money, because the regular express trains below will get you there not much slower, and for much cheaper. **Ignore these fools!** If you're a railfan like me, and have a bit extra to spend, you owe it to yourself to experience just once. As far as Shinkansen routes go, it's the cheapest one you can do!

### The JR Thunderbird

This is JR's premium express service. You get plush, aeroplane style seats and a very quiet cabin. Tickets go for ¥640 for unreserved, which is fine because they're rarely busy. The journey from Umeda is about 22 minutes.

You can buy Thunderbird tickets from the JR ticket machines, or if you tap on with your ICOCA card, the ticket inspector can tap it and add the extra fare once you're onboard. I prefer to just buy tickets for these services because my Japanese is basically non-existent.

Be careful if you buy tickets to specify JR Thunderbird and not JR Special Rapid. You'll know you bought the right one if you get two tickets: a fare ticket, and a second Thunderbird service one. Use the fare ticket in the machines.

### The JR Special Rapid

This is JR's commuter service that skips stations. Tickets are ¥520, so a bit cheaper than the Thunderbird, but you still get there in about 24 minutes.

The carriages are closer to regular subway cars, albeit with some front-facing seats. Otherwise, it's still very comfortable, and you do build up a decent speed once you've left Osaka.

If you use your ICOCA card, you can just tap on in Osaka and off in Kyoto with no fuss, which is awesome.

### The Hankyu Limited Express

This is a service run on the Hankyu Kyoto Main Line. It's the cheapest option at ¥400 (wow!) and gets you to their private rail terminal connected to Umeda in 44 minutes.

The travel time is definitely longer. The carriages also feel like regular commuter cars with seats along the walls. It also gets really busy.

The big advantage is the line runs right through Kyoto, so chances are you can hop on anywhere after binging on tourist sights. By the time you factor in the time to get to Kyoto station to get the JR trains, their time advantage isn't as great.

I'd say stick to the JR ones if you can, but its worth to experience once.
