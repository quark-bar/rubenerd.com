<p>I was in the city late yesterday afternoon and I had my camera with me <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/sets/72157603479996933/">so I thought I&#39;d take a few quick photos</a>. Problem was, no sooner had I got the camera out and set up the sky turned grey and within fifteen minutes it started pouring!</p>
<p>Best I could do under the circs ;).</p>
<h3>The Square</h3>
<p>Most of the area here is made up of pedestrian walk ways and parks, with two entrances to the  Raffles Place MRT station.</p>

<h3>Singapore Land Tower</h3>
<p>Formally Shell House where my father used to work in 1997. I tried to get the reflection of the other tower all symmetrical but didn&#39;t quite work!</p>

<h3>Republic Plaza</h3>
<p>My personal favourite, I wonder how much the rent is? ;-)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/2116459153/" title="DSCF1380 by rubenerd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2156/2116459153_da93de3e14.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="DSCF1380" /></a></p>
<h3>OUB Centre</h3>
<p>I had to sit in a really contorted and embarrassing position to get this photo right!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/2117241150/" title="OUB Centre by rubenerd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2346/2117241150_d2689dcf33.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="OUB Centre" /></a></p>
<h3>HSBC</h3>
<p>And here&#39;s my attempt at being all &quot;arty&quot;. I call it: &quot;HSBC Urban Jungle&quot;. Sometimes I&#39;m so creative with names I could just shoot myself in the face like Dick Cheney.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/2116462883/" title="HSBC Building by rubenerd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2063/2116462883_448de69d30.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="HSBC Building" /></a></p>
<h3>Suntec City, Esplanande</h3>
<p>Unfortunately by the time I got around to photographing Suntec City and the Esplanade in the distance the rain had already started falling, so the picture is pretty crappy!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/2117242612/" title="Suntec City, Esplanade under ominous skies by rubenerd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2168/2117242612_4acb352577.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Suntec City, Esplanade under ominous skies" /></a></p>
