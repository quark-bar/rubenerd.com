<p>A <a href="http://blogs.abc.net.au/queensland/2012/04/qld-premiers-literary-awards-scrapped.html">statement</a> from the new centre-right government in Queensland:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Queensland Government has decided not to proceed with the Queensland Premier’s Literary Awards in 2012 which will save Queensland taxpayers $244,475, not including the cost of resourcing the Awards.</p></blockquote>
<p>And only a <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1193365/1/.html">few days later</a> from Singapore:</p>
<blockquote><p>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will donate $350,000 towards three new awards. The awards support community bonding, social service, and the arts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly there are more issues at play here, but fascinating timing nonetheless!</p>
