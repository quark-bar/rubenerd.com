<p>An <a href="http://tech.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=2829841&#038;cid=39895437">AC on Slashdot</a>, so take with a grain of salt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Do you want to know why the government continues with it even though [security measures don’t] work? It’s because insurance rates for airports and airlines would go through the roof if we didn’t have this in place. [..] Our lives are governed by actuarial tables.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hadn&#39;t ever thought about this, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it were true. Certainly the airlines themselves have a business interest in <strong>not</strong> have these carcinogenic full body scanners and sexual harassment, because they discourage people from traveling.</p>
<p>For the record, security theater was a term coined by my hero Bruce Schneier to describe security measures that are entirely for show, without any benefit.</p>
