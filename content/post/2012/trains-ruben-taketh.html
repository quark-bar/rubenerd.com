<p>Lots of people were getting on board with #adayinthelifeApril2 on Twitter today, so I took the opportunity to reboot my <a href="http://trainsrubentaketh.tumblr.com/">Trains Ruben Taketh</a> blog, and snap the above photo.</p>
<p>At some point I&#39;ll upload more train photos from around the world, for now it&#39;s just a terrible site where I take photos of Sydney trains I&#39;ve been on. As exciting as it sounds!</p>
