<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/kagami177/status/157431979443355648">@kagami177</a> deliciously observed an <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Discuss:What_is_avocado_constant">Answers.com&#39;s response</a> by &quot;Mistoffeles&quot;, written in 2009:</p>
<blockquote><p>Would the avocado constant not be the total number of ripe avocados in the entire universe at any given time, which never changes as somewhere in the universe when one avocado is used up to make a guacamole (a mole of guaca, of course), another becomes fully ripened?</p></blockquote>
<p>And here I was thinking I was so original calling it Avocado&#39;s Constant. My childhood shattered in one paragraph! Bulletproof theory though, just saying.</p>
