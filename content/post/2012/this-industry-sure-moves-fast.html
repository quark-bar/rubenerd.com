<p>Owing to an incredibly busy month with family and university, this has been the quietest Rubenerd.com has been since January 2008 (<a href="//rubenerd.com/archive/">check it out</a>). For interest sake, I thought I&#39;d check out one of the few things I was <a href="//rubenerd.com/nokia-buying-trolltech/">talking about back then</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trolltech bought by Nokia, MySQL bought by Sun Microsystemsâ€¦ what is the world [of free and open source software] coming to?</p></blockquote>
<p>While surprising at the time, Nokia has since found itself on the rocks and looking to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/08/nokia-reportedly-planning-to-sell-qt-as-more-developers-are-laid-off/">divest itself of Qt</a>, and Sun Microsystems was <a href="//rubenerd.com/sun-oracle/">bought by Oracle</a>. Just goes to show just how fast this industry moves!</p>
