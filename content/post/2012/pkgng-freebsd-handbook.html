<p>As far as I&#39;m concerned, this makes it official! Under <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/pkgng-intro.html">5.5 Using pkgng for Binary Package Management</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>pkgng is an improved replacement for the traditional FreeBSD pkg_install package management tools, offering many features that make dealing with binary packages faster and easier. The first release of pkgng was in August, 2012.</p></blockquote>
<p>My only lingering gripe with pkgng was you still needed to download the ports tree or use pkg_add to install it, which seemed redundant. This has <em>also</em> been addressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>FreeBSD 9.1 and later includes a &#8220;bootstrap&#8221; utility for pkgng. The bootstrap utility will download and install pkgng. [..] To bootstrap the system, run: <code># /usr/sbin/pkg</pre>
<p>I&#39;m counting this as an early Yuletide present from the lovely, epic FreeBSD developers and documentation team. I&#39;d jump in my chair with joy, <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/veritable-pain-in-the-neck/">if I could</a>!</p>
