<p>I knew how this worked in FreeBSD, and fortunately it works in the Red Hat world as well. First, make a backup of your existing timezone file, the create a symbolic link to your timezone. I&#39;ve seen people copying the file instead, but I feel safer linking.</p>
<pre># mv /etc/localtime /etc/localtime.back# ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/Singapore /etc/localtime</pre>
<p>I&#39;m tempted to set my timezone to Reykjav√≠k, it&#39;s <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/forecasts/sydney.shtml">HOT</a> in Sydney today. Nagato Yuki has the right idea. <em>A-heh-hem.</em></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/dai1313/status/272534522862657536">@dai1311</a> on Twitter says that this also works on Arch Linux. Incidentally, his avatar is of Yuki!</p>
