<p>She&#39;d be 57 today. Fortunately, I had a suitably <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/8015133487/" title="Happy Birthday Mummy~ by rubenerd, on Flickr">embarrassing photo</a> from her birthday celebration in 2005 to share with all of you. Good thing she&#39;s not around or I&#39;d receive a P.G. Wodehouse book to the face!</p>
<p>What I wouldn&#39;t give to celebrate this day with you again. I love you â™¡</p>
