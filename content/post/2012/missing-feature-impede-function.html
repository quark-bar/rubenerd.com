<p>Quote from a 3/5 star <a title="Samsung SyncMaster 2232GW Review &#038; Rating - PCMag.com" href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2273698,00.asp">PC Magazine review</a> of the Samsung display  I picked up back in 2007:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2273698,00.asp"><p>While Iâ€™m pleased that the digital port is HDCP compliant, I think a monitor in this price range should offer something more in the way of multimedia connectivity, such as an HDMI port or a card reader. </p></blockquote>
<p>A monitor losing points because it doesn&#39;t have a card reader? No wonder my toaster only got 3/5 stars. </p>
<p>Sorry I couldn&#39;t resist, I&#39;ve always wanted <a title="Four-Slot SD Card-Reader Looks Like Miniature Toaster - Wired GadgetLab" href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/12/four-slot-sd-card-reader-looks-like-miniature-toaster/">one of these</a>.</p>
