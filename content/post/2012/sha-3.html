<p>In 2007, it seemed all we read about in crypto circles were successful attacks against the MD5 and SHA family of hashing algorithms. Well after a six year contest, NIST is about ready to <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/hash/sha-3/index.html">announce</a> a suitable replacement to be dubbed SHA-3.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Bruce Schneier <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/09/sha-3_will_be_a.html">isn&#39;t so enthusiastic</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/09/sha-3_will_be_a.html"><p>It’s not that the new hash functions aren’t any good, it’s that we don’t really need one. [..] We didn’t know [in 2006] how long the various SHA-2 variants would remain secure. But it’s 2012, and SHA-512 is still looking good.</p></blockquote>
<p>That said, Skein and it&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threefish">Threefish</a> block cipher look really intriguing. I eschewed Rijndael/AES and use Twofish for all my personal crypto.</p>
