<p>When I first heard of <em>Black Rock Shooter</em> and its anime adaptation, I was expecting a franchise about a kick arse, renewable energy-touting superhero taking down the coal lobby by staring people down. Needless to say, I was <strong>entirely wrong</strong>.</p>
<p>Forgive me, my last three posts were about more serious news topics, and I needed an entirely pointless break! It seems people are disappointed with the anime, but for those of us who never played the game or read the manga, would it be worth watching?</p>
