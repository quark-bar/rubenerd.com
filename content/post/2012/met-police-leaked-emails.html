<blockquote><p>The Metropolitan police said emails were sent out to 1,136 victims, mostly of car theft or pickpockets, as part of a survey on 30 January. But the addresses were put in the wrong section of the email, which meant they were shared with other victims.</p></blockquote>
<p>While New Google and Facebook are taking the headlines, I&#39;d still argue the biggest threat to online privacy still comes from people misusing IT (and from <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sherlock_(TV_series)">Sherlock</a>). Part of the solution is education and effective oversight, but even then we&#39;re all prone to making mistakes, and our software isn&#39;t perfect.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Metropolitan Police should look into using email clients with stricter field validation!</p>
