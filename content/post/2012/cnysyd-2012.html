<p>I arrived a little too late for much of the <a href="http://www.sydneychinesenewyear.com/">Chinese New Year Markets in Sydney</a> this weekend, but that didn&#39;t stop me gorging on dumplings and taking a few photos! Enjoy, and <span style="color:red">Gong Xi Fa Cai</span>! :)</p>

<h3>The early evening</h3>

<h3>The night</h3>
<p>After wandering around enjoying the atmosphere for an hour, I head off to the nearby Starbucks on Elizabeth Street. In Singapore they had Chinese New Year themed drinks with mandarin and other such flavours, but no such luck here. Oh well!</p>
<p>I did some more wandering around Chinatown, then came back after the sun set to take a few more. Without a tripod and with the D60 that looks super grainy even at 1600 ISO it was tough, but still fun :).</p>
