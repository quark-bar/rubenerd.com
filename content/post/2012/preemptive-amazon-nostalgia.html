<p>I get nostalgia for the most random things. Case in point, I was on the Amazon Affiliate Associates Thingy website this morning, and I noticed their documentation still shows a screenshot of their classic site design. Will they replace it soon? Maybe. And when they do, I have this old one preserved here for posterity.</p>
<p>I think I may have a problem.</p>
