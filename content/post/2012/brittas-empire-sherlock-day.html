<p>Celebrating Empire Day in style here in the Schade family household, by posting a veritable litany of randomness, eating crumpets and drinking tea. At least half my genes are pleased with this arrangement, the others aren&#39;t so sure. Oh, I say, <em>rah-ther</em>.</p>

<h3>Britanime</h3>
<p>We start our cavalcade of British Empire blogging whatnot (a spot of tea?) with an image from Detective Conan, and from the K-On! movie where the girls found themselves eating cake in London. I can only imagine the latter, having never seen it.</p>

<p>First image submitted by <a href="http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=13140082">穂積</a> on Pixiv, the second by the fabulously smashing folks at Kyoto Animation who managed to distill moe and dispense it in lethal doses!</p>
<h3>Cathay Pacific Sherlock</h3>
<p>We continue by flying to Hong Kong, one of their former colonial possessions. Given I only just posted a story about aviation, it seemed fitting. Wait a minute, Singapore was a colonial posession too. Those Brits have been everywhere; and they weren&#39;t exactly original with their subordinate&#39;s flag designs either.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/flag.colonial.sg.png" alt="Flag of Colonial Singapore, as it were" style="height:125px; width:249px; border-right:0px;" /><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/flag.colonial.hk.png" alt="Flag of Colonial Hong Kong, as it were" style="height:125px; width:249px; border-left:0px;" /></p>
<p>Anyway, we&#39;re getting distracted chaps. On the <a href="http://www.ausbt.com.au/photos-and-review-cathay-pacific-s-new-long-haul-international-economy-seats-for-boeing-777-747-and-airbus-a330">Australian Business Traveler site</a>, what did the reviewer use to test the new inflight entertainment system of select Cathay Pacific aircraft? That&#39;s right, <a href="http://www.ausbt.com.au/photos-and-review-cathay-pacific-s-new-long-haul-international-economy-seats-for-boeing-777-747-and-airbus-a330">Sherlock</a>!</p>

<p>Naturally, I rewatched an episode of the show again this evening. The first of season two, because it was rather cheeky. I still haven&#39;t got over the anger that CBS will be creating an American version, what an abject travesty against decency and good taste!</p>
<p>To help calm down from this, here&#39;s a photo of our favourite duo:</p>

<p>Little did they know when meeting for the first time… :&#39;). Oh dear, I&#39;m using emoticons and writing vague sentences with regards to this show just like fangirls. They&#39;re so dreamy… ^^</p>
<h3>The Brittas Empire</h3>
<p>Speaking of British television, one of my favourites from years past is The Brittas Empire. Along with Fawlty Towers, Some Mothers Do &#39;Ave &#39;Em, Keeping Up Appearances, Red Dwarf, Monty Python and too many others to count, this was one of the British television shows growing up that I simply could not get enough of. </p>
<p>I forget which station I used to tune in with The Family&trade; to watch this each week in Singapore, but it was absolutely hilarious. The gist was an uptight manager of a recreation centre in suburban England that had to contend with incompetent and/or silly staff, government regulations and… <em>customers</em>! With comedic results ;).</p>

<p>On this Empire Day, I found myself learning something new about the show, from the <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/BrittasEmpire/status/179150965478395904">@BrittasEmpire</a> Twitter account:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://mobile.twitter.com/BrittasEmpire/status/179150965478395904"><p>You bastard! You’ll never get away with this! (Brittas swears for first &#038; only time) S1 Ep4.</p></blockquote>
<p>It also took me this long to realise that I&#39;m discussing the Brittas Empire on Empire Day. Who&#39;d have thought.</p>
<h3>Britanime part two, fine folks</h3>
<p>I was going to round off this post with a mention of Hetalia, the anime series featuring moe anthropomorphisms of nation states with ridiculous results, but I figure this page unfairly slants towards depicting British gentleman. </p>
<p>So here is a picture of Lynette Bishop, the moe anthropomorphism of the British Spitfire from the 501st Joint Figher Wing of Strike Witches. You&#39;d better believe it.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/anime.lynettebishop.jpg" alt="" style="height:400px; width:500px;" /></p>
<p>Don&#39;t worry, I didn&#39;t understand it either. A jolly Empire Day to you!</p>
