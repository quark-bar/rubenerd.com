<p>For the first couple of years since we lost mummy on Yule Eve-Eve, the 25th of December was a pretty sombre affair. Last year was bittersweet.</p>
<p>This year, for the first time, I felt as though Yuletide joy was with us again. My dad, sister and I sat around and exchanged presents to an awful vinyl record of 1980s pop stars butchering holiday classics, then had a nice late breakfast (Schade family savoury French Toast!); talked and joked for hours about life, the universe and everything; played some traditional Nintento Wii bowling; and chowed down on an amazing home cooked turkey dinner made in the way only my parents know how.</p>
<p>Along with a can of original, imported Irn-Bru and a registration code for OmniFocus (YES!), my sister and old man also bought me a MacBook Air which should be arriving on the 31st. Speechless!</p>
<p>A few days prior, over some coffee, tea and cuddles at a lovely French cafe in Sydney, my beautiful girlfriend <a href="http://claratse.com/">Clara</a> gave me some of the most thoughtful presents ever. She is responsible for practically my entire nendoroid collection at this stage, and to have one of <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/nagato-yuki/">Nagato Yuki</a> from the enduring <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/suzumiya-haruhi/">Suzumiya Haruhi</a> franchise is particularly apt ^^. I&#39;d argue she&#39;s cuter than Yuki though.</p>
<p>Above all else though, as with my family on the day itself, the best present I could have ever wished for was her company. I hope to share in that with her for many years to come :&#39;). Happy belated holidays!</p>
