<p>It&#39;s the kind of thing you expect them to say, but you&#39;re still disappointed when they do. <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/privacy-or-protection-you-cant-have-it-both-ways-says-julia-gillard-20131122-2xzht.html" title="Privacy or protection? You can&#39;t have it both ways, says Julia Gillard">Jonathan Swan reporting for the Sydney Morning Herald</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Australians cannot have it both ways in wanting their government simultaneously to respect their privacy and also to protect them from terrorist attacks, says former prime minister Julia Gillard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I consider violating our privacy to be a terrorist act. Such sentiments will come back to haunt her one day, as they will for all the politicians who&#39;ve let frenzied terrorist paranoia overshadow rational thought and regard for the dignity of their people. Maybe.</p>
<p>Prior to today, I placed Julia Gillard in relatively high regard. What she endured with class as Prime Minister was appalling; Australia at its worst. I feel betrayed that she&#39;s taken this regrettable position.</p>
