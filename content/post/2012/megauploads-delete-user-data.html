<p>Stewart Mitchell <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/372478/megauploads-user-data-set-to-be-deleted">writing for PC Pro</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/372478/megauploads-user-data-set-to-be-deleted"><p>Prosecutors in the US plan to start deleting data from the servers of file-sharing site Megauploads this week.</p></blockquote>
<p>Uh huh, sure ;).</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/372478/megauploads-user-data-set-to-be-deleted"><p>The move has lead to claims that wiping files could make it impossible for the accused to defend themselves and deprive millions of users access to their personal files.</p></blockquote>
<p>This doesn&#39;t pass the smell test for me. I fear that access to data will be revoked, but law enforcement will maintain it to mine at a later date. On hard drives without encryption that people leave in taxis by mistake, but that&#39;s another issue.</p>
