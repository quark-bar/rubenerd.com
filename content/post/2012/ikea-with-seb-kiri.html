<p>Compared to the <a title="Tuesday 24th January 2012: Car crash in Earlwood, a mortality check!" href="http://rubenerd.com/car-crash-in-earlwood/">horror</a> that was yesterday, today was spent with good friends in one of my favourite places! I&#39;ll let the illustrious Sebastian (pictured above) <a href="http://alonelyseptember.org/ikea-with-friends/">take you through it in detail</a>, but essentially we strolled around the wonderland that is IKEA, shared lunch, cracked jokes and generally had a great time. For someone still coming down from shattered nerves, it was wonderfulâ€¦ well, other than for the <a href="http://twitpic.com/8bfo65">sudden floods</a> of course!</p>
