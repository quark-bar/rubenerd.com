<p>Regardless of where you stand on the Google+ integration into Google search results, this site is an eye opener for what it returns, and who&#39;s behind it.</p>

<h3>Complete with an Orwellian name!</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.focusontheuser.org/">From the page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>How much better would social search be if Google surfaced results from all across the web? The results speak for themselves. We created a tool that uses Google’s own relevance measure—the ranking of their organic search results—to determine what social content should appear in the areas where Google+ results are currently hardcoded.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now in Google&#39;s defence, they claimed on Google+ that they couldn&#39;t perform the same (or similar) thing themselves because Twitter (and presumably Facebook, etc) had closed access to their silos. Right?</p>
<blockquote><p>All of the information in this demo comes from Google itself, and all of the ranking decisions are made by Google’s own algorithms. No other services or APIs are accessed.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Ouch</h3>
<p>Now I don&#39;t see Google+ as being a credible threat. I also still don&#39;t trust Facebook, and feel like they&#39;re playing politics here by capitalising on the stumbling of an opponent. As a service Google singled out to make an example of, you can bet the folks at Twitter also relished the opportunity to design the service.</p>
<p>Despite all these caveats, the results speak for themselves. Google could implement this, no question.</p>
<p>What&#39;s most breathtaking about this is Google did something that Facebook, Twitter and the like couldn&#39;t do: unite them. Seemingly Google didn&#39;t get the <em>divide and conquer</em> memo.</p>
<p>Not to pound a dead horse here, but I keep coming back to my theory that marketers and managers now run Google, not its otherwise talented engineers. This is clearly not a technical issue, it&#39;s a matter of PR and priorities.</p>
