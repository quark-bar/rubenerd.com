<p>While I was gone from <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Rubenerd">Twitter</a> on Monday, I was <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/grass_desu/status/270402933491904512">tweeted this</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://mobile.twitter.com/grass_desu/status/270402933491904512"><p>I don’t know her name I’m sorry…. @Rubenerd <a href="http://twitpic.com/behyf9">twitpic.com/behyf9</a></p></blockquote>
<p>It would appear to be a Sony Alpha lens cap, and <a href="http://myanimelist.net/character/34470/Kurisu_Makise">Makise Kurisu</a>, everyone&#39;s favourite scientist! Well, that may be a stretch. Wait, the only thing stretching are her shorts.</p>
<p>Ironically, the last time I posted about her was when I was <a href="//rubenerd.com/steinsseagate/">discussing hard drives</a>. Wow, that was a lame pun.</p>
