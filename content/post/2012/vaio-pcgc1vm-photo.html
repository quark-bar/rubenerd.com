<p>Going through my backups this afternoon, I stumbled upon all the photos I took with my <a href="http://www.sony.com.sg/support/product/pcg-c1vm">Sony Vaio PCG-C1VM</a> laptop. It was one of the first laptops to include a built in webcam, and took horribly bad 320&#215;240 images! Still, at the time it was my only digital camera, so I spent ages taking shots with it like the silly nerd I was.</p>
<p>According to the time stamp, this photo was taken on the 11th of July 2001. I think it was on our balcony at <a href="http://www.singaporeexpats.com/singapore-property-pictures/condo/high-point.htm">Highpoint</a> in Singapore. Nostalgia!</p>
