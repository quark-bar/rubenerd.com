<p>As Bruce Leibowitz says on his <a href="http://www.airliners.net/photo/Untitled-%28Qantas%29/Boeing-767-238-ER/1351262/">photo page on Airliners.net</a>, a rare glimpse at part of an aeroplane we don&#39;t normally see!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/767family/background.html">Boeing 767-200ER</a> was first introduced in 1984, so we have some pretty retro computer hardware here. Funnily enough, I&#39;d trust my life to such hardware before some of the newer stuff coming out now.</p>
