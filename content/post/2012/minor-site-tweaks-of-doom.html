<p>Taking a quick break from writing a development proposal, I made some minor tweaks on the site today. On the site? To the site?</p>
<ul>
<li>The layout is now centred, not to the left. I preferred it the old way, but the number of tweets and emails from well meaning people asking me if my CSS was broken got to be too much. Actually, I did this a few days ago.
</p>
</li>
<li>Lines from the header have been removed.
</p>
</li>
<li>After two years of CSS3 rounded corners, Iâ€™ve got rid of those too. They looked okay, but they were inconsistent with the rest of the design. Or at least, I thought so.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve also done some other CSS tweaks in preparation for the unveiling of something much bigger soon. Or should I say, someone much bigger. And no, it&#39;s not Netscape Navigator Gold 2.02 support.</p>
