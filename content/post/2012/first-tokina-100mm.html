<p>The depth of field and manual focusing on my D60 will be challenging for a rank amateur such as myself, but the sharpness in the focused areas is nothing short of breathtaking. The dust on the leavesâ€¦ I didn&#39;t even see that with my own eyes!</p>
<p>Coincidentally, this is the first photo I&#39;ve uploaded to <a href="http://500px.com/RubenSchade">my 500px account</a>. Not sure whether I&#39;ll <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd">give up Flickr</a> just yet, but giving it a try :).</p>
