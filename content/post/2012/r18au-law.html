<p>In a shocking move of common sense, the Australian Senate has made the trivially easy process of importing R18 games into Australia unnecessary. Right?</p>
<p>ABC News carried this at the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-06-19/r18-video-game-rating-passes-senate/4078460">end of their report</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-06-19/r18-video-game-rating-passes-senate/4078460"><p>Provided the states pass complementary legislation, the changes are due to come into effect on January 1.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve been told on Twitter it&#39;s a shoe-in, but I wouldn&#39;t get my hopes up yet. Let&#39;s just sayâ€¦ past experience with trusting all our different layers of government ;).</p>
<p>I don&#39;t play R18 games, but I <a href="http://rubenerd.com/michael-atkinson-democracy-games/">blogged about it in 2010</a>, complete with a Haruhi/SHUFFLE image. Because I could!</p>
