<p>I use half a dozen languages for work and fun, but when I need to quickly get stuff done, <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> still does the job. I couldn&#39;t imagine my life without it.</p>
<pre class="code">#!/usr/bin/env perl -w
use strict;

&amp;birthday("25th");

sub birthday {
    print("Happy $_[0] birthday!n");
}
</pre>
<p>A huge thank you to Peter Whiting who showed me Perl when I was 19, and to Larry Wall, Tom Christiansen and Jon Orwant for the language and the Camel Book :).</p>
