<p>Aside from the technological significance of the DEC PDP11 computers, I&#39;m also so thoroughly in love with their design, colours, fonts and advertising material. </p>
<p>Quintessentially 70s. I want that chair! The carpet! The red walls! A bank of dead PDP11s for hanging my clothes in, with a Mac Mini running an emulator inside it!</p>
