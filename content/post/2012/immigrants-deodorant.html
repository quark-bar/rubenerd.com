<p>As an Australian who spent his formitave years overseas, I&#39;m acutely aware of how people around the world perceive us, and how embarrasing it is when a luddite Australian politician makes racist comments. </p>
<blockquote><p>Teresa Gambaro’s comments, <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/immigration/hygiene-lessons-will-help-migrants-integrate-coalition/story-fn9hm1gu-1226240326959">in an interview with the Australian</a>, provoked a firestorm of criticism. Gambaro said that new arrivals needed to be taught about &#8220;what are norms in <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/australia">Australia</a>&#8220;, which also included how to queue properly.</p></blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/10/australian-mp-immigrants-taught-deodorant?CMP=twt_gu">The Guardian</a> in the UK. Memories of living in Asia during Pauline Hanson and John Howard… flooding back.</p>
