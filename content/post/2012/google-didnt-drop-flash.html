<p>John Gruber on the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/02/07/chrome-flash">lack of Flash</a> in Chrome for Android:</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember when Android’s (and the BlackBerry Playbook’s, and WebOS’s) support for Flash was supposed to be a competitive advantage against iOS?</p></blockquote>
<p>I was called out by multiple people when I defended Apple&#39;s move to not include Flash, and made the case that mobile Flash made no sense. I&#39;m sure it was the same for John; after all, we&#39;re just fanboys!</p>
<p>Still, while it&#39;s tempting to engage in a little schadenfreude, the pertitent detail is <a href="http://rubenerd.com/mobile-flash-end/">Adobe ceased support</a> for the mobile version of Flash, it wasn&#39;t Google&#39;s decision. They don&#39;t deserve ire, or praise, as a result.</p>
