<p>Today the <a href="http://utsanime.net/">Anime@UTS club</a> had their Annual General Meeting, where we elected new members to the executive team, ate pizza and ice cream cake, watched Ace Attorney, and generally had a smashing time. It&#39;s the <a href="//rubenerd.com/anime-animeuts-deliberations/">second AGM</a> I&#39;ve been a part of.</p>
<p>Behind closed doors, I was voted in as the club&#39;s new webmaster!</p>
<p>As the saying goes, I tend to mistrust any clubs that would have me as a member, but the execs, members and our illustrious president Alex have really created something special here, and I&#39;m looking forward to contributing in a more meaningful way.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for your vote of confidence ^_^</p>
