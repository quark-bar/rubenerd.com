<p>My glorious friend and potential partner in crime Vadim has <a href="http://jamiejakov.com/">launched a blog</a>. He&#39;s already beaten me in the number of new posts for this month, and we&#39;re only two days into it!</p>
<blockquote><p>Love technology and anime (+some games like SSFIV:AE2012), thats what Iâ€™m mainly gonna blog about. I play the trumpet so you might see some music related stuff here too. Love swimming; hey you! yea you! Stop sitting at your computer all day and join me for a swim! Learning Japanese and very into japan, so that will be a very trendy topic on this blog as well ;)</p></blockquote>
<p>He has quite the thing for Kenny, who wears as much orange as he does! Grab his <a href="http://jamiejakov.com/feed/">RSS feed</a> before I break your dam. No wait, that was Stan and Cartman.</p>
