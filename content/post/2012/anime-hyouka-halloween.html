<p>The only reason I used to care even slightly about Halloween were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_%28series%29">The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror</a> episodes. Now I have another reason. Can someone with visual talent please do a text filter as soon as possible? Kthxbye.</p>
