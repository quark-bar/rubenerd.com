<p>With all this excitement about cloud storage, I thought I&#39;d try something a little different!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>Pronounced &#8220;wah-lah&#8221;, apparently!</h3>
<p>Wuala is a cloud storage service by LaCie that comes with 5GB of free storage, with the option to purchase more. Like the sucker for advertising I am, I saw a label for the service on a LaCie external hard drive at an Apple Store, and was immediately interested!</p>
<p>What sets Wuala it apart from Dropbox and Google Drive is it encrypts your data before it&#39;s sent to their servers. Technically speaking, this means not even Wuala employees can access your data, unless you make it public (which you can do).</p>
<p>As an added bonus in a similar vein, Wuala&#39;s severs are based in Switzerland, Germany and France. While Europe&#39;s privacy laws are by no means perfect either, these days I feel safer having my data there than the United States.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>As I&#39;ve mentioned previously, I dislike installing client software for online services, especially for something that may as well be public anyway. Given Wuala is performing local encryption before sending my data off however, I see their software as a necessary evil.</p>
<p>Once you install their client software (the subject for a future post), you&#39;re given the open to create a new Wuala account. Registration is fairly straight forward, and after responding to a confirmation email you&#39;re in your new cloud drive.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.wuala.app.png" style="width:500px;" alt="Wuala client after logging in" class="transparent" /></p>
<p>The client software runs in Oracle&#39;s Java or the OpenJDK (my choice) and should be pretty familiar to those used to the Finder, Nautilus, Thunar and the like. You can create folders, upload/download files, and set folders and files public or private (the default). They also have iOS and Android client applications.</p>
<p>What I really like however is it&#39;s ability to mount as a virtual local volume. Having tried on a fairly vanilla Fedora install, Wuala was able to create a new Fuse mount without any trouble, though the first time it took a minute or so to create it. Then I was able to drag and drop files from within Nautilus:</p>

<p>And explore with the shell. Imagine what you could do with this!</p>

<p>It has lots of other features, though I haven&#39;t looked much more into it yet. Something called &quot;Time Travel&quot; looks as though it could be a revision system of some sort.</p>
<p>So far I&#39;m impressed. I&#39;ll report my day-to-day experience in the coming days.</p>
