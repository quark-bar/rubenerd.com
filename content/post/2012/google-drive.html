<p>I&#39;m commenting on this news story exactly one year after my <a href="//rubenerd.com/dropping-sanity-into-box/">post about Dropbox</a>. Freaky!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>The story</h3>
<p>So Google will be taking on Dropbox with their own cloud storage service, titled Google Drive. I thought Google Drive was when they drive around capturing home WiFi locations and data. Heh.</p>
<p>Whereas Dropbox comes with 2GB of storage, Google Drive will come with 5. Not sure whether that&#39;s 5GB or 5GiB (Mac OS X and Fedora 16 with Gnome 3 have made me even more acutely aware of these differences), but we&#39;ll wait and see.</p>
<h3>Please no more client software!</h3>

<p>From what I&#39;m reading on the intertubes, some are comparing this move to Google releasing Gmail, with similar predictions of success. It&#39;s a cute idea, but Gmail offered an order of magnitude more capacity than competing email services at the time; 5GB is hardly a similar leap. 5TB, now <em>there</em> would be something!</p>
<p>Mostly though, I&#39;ve resisted using the likes of Dropbox because I can&#39;t stand installing extra software, and wasn&#39;t going to go through the rigamarole of installing a Linux binary compatibility layer and test it to run on FreeBSD. If Google Drive allowed remote access through established protocols, FUSE mounts and the like, I&#39;d be on it faster than you could say &quot;data mine&quot;.</p>

<p>Of course, as with all cloud storage services you&#39;d want to observe some precautions. As I <a href="//rubenerd.com/dropping-sanity-into-box/">said about Dropbox</a> on this day last year:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t understand the increasingly negative attitudes people are having towards services like Dropbox. People who don’t encrypt their personal files before sending them off to a public, shared server clearly want their data to be read in the clear, so who cares?</p></blockquote>
<p>Encrypting data <em>before</em> uploading would be <strong>an absolute must</strong>, any other use would obviously be reckless unless it was media you&#39;d publish in public. Even then, you&#39;d have to weigh up the utility you&#39;d derive with Google knowing even more about your interests, and the legal ramifications of having your stuff hosted under United States jurisdiction, assuming that&#39;s where it ends up. Eh, just encrypt everything, play it safe!</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be following this story. If it turns out Google Drive is another of the company&#39;s now infamous <em>me too!</em> products that also requires client software just like Dropbox, nothing to see here, move on. If it doesn&#39;t require extra middleman software, is simple and has a web UI that&#39;s usable (unlike what they did to Google Reader, Gmail and the like), they might have a hit.</p>
