<p>Yay, got some more spam DMs from cracked Twitter accounts this afternoon!</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi this user is making really bad rumors about you [dodgy link redacted]</p></blockquote>
<p>And one I haven&#39;t seen for a while.</p>
<blockquote><p>lolâ€¦omg i am laughing so hard at this pic of me my friend uploaded [dodgy link redacted]</p></blockquote>
<p>On the one hand I find it hard to believe anyone still falls for this stuff, but I guess they are if the spammers can still justify sending them out.</p>
