<p>Just a quick tip of the hat to <a href="http://netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> for their <a href="http://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/proudly_announcing_netbsd_6_0">6.0 release</a>. I use Fedora Linux on my laptop and Mac OS X on the desktop, but I&#39;d prefer to be using NetBSD. As far as I&#39;m concerned, it&#39;s the cleanest, most elegant operating system I&#39;ve ever used.</p>
<p>I also made some <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p2764/">My-HiME desktop backgrounds</a> for NetBSD back in 2008. She was predominately orange, and so is NetBSD. I was in the zone.</p>
<p>NetBSD in an Australian VPS, now that&#39;d be awesome. I wonder if they exist?</p>
