<p>Having lived back in Sydney for over a year now, I was interested to read the responses to <em>&quot;How do you describe Sydney in three words?&quot;</em> <a href="http://www.sydneyism.com/how-do-you-describe-sydney-in-three-words/">on Sydneyism</a>. Of the fifteen responses, four used more than three words.</p>
<p>Therefore, my answer: <em>Some Can&#39;t Count!</em></p>
<p>As for the photo, it&#39;s one of mine that I reduced to use three colours (grey of course not being a colourâ€¦ or is it?). I suddently have DOS nostalgia.</p>
