<p>The writers at the <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/follow-up_hp.php">Brand New</a> blog received followup from HP:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2008, HP asked marketing agency Moving Brands to propose new ideas for various elements of HP’s brand identity, including fonts, graphics, and logos.</p>
<p>HP is one of the world’s most valuable brands and has no plans to adopt the new logo proposed by Moving Brands. HP did implement some of the other design elements shown in the case study.</p></blockquote>
<p>Old news, but I <a title="Thursday 15th December 2011: Do we all like HP's potential new logo, again?" href="//rubenerd.com/hp-2011-logo/">discussed HP&#39;s potential new logo</a> at length in December last year, and I figured I should follow up on it. &quot;Last year&quot;… that phrase still sounds funny.</p>
<p>I&#39;m relieved they&#39;re not changing their logo. HP may have lost the plot a bit in the consumer space of late, but I still hold out hope for them.</p>
