<p>The webs are all a-twitter this evening about Seagate buying out LaCie, the storage company perhaps best known for their premium Mac hard drives, and memory keys in the shape of keys. I can still remember flipping through the catalogues and gawking at those gorgeous bright yellow FireWire 400 drives: they could hold a whopping 8GB! Needless to say, another enduring brand that I grew up is slowly fading away.</p>
<p>Of course, the story is a little more complex than what is generally being reported; Seagate is buying a controlling stake in LaCie, and may buy the company outright with government approval. In light of Google and Motorola Mobility though, I doubt this will be too much of an issue.</p>
<p>Aside from giving me an excuse to get nostalgic again, I only mention this because I only just <a href="//rubenerd.com/wuala-review/">blogged about LaCie</a>. Looks like I&#39;ll need <a href="//rubenerd.com/steinsseagate/">Makise Kurisu&#39;s help</a>â€¦ again!</p>
