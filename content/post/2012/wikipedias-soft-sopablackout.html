<p>Wikipedia has just gone dark, though initially I didn&#39;t notice because I use NoScript. Turns out they&#39;re using JavaScript to block it for <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOPA_initiative">various reasons</a> and more.</p>
<p>Perosnally, I reckon they should have taken the angle that they&#39;re making a statement on the technological infeasiblity of blocking material, given the internet treats censorship as damage and routes around it. Blocking data will only render people more creative in finding ways to get to it. And they will, every time.</p>
<p>I feel like I&#39;m talking about <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/openinternet/">The Great Firewall of Australia</a> again!</p>
