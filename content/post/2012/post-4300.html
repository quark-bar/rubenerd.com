<p>The previous entry was Rubenerd.com post #4300! Time for another of our beloved <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">pointless milestones</a>!</p>

<h3>What’s with this post thing?</h3>
<p>Those of you who have been reading Rubenerd.com for years… you may need to see a therapist. You may also remember for each <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">pointless milestone</a> I include information on an industrial cleaning device as something utterly pointless.</p>
<p>How did this start? A very handsome question, and I&#39;ll answer it. When I wrote the first <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">pointless milestone</a>, I wanted to include a relevent image, but when I typed the post number into Google Images and hit search, all I kept getting were photos of industrial cleaning devices. Since then, I&#39;ve made it a habit to do this on purpose!</p>

<h3>Yeah okay, so what’s that buggy thing?</h3>
<p>For post 4300, I uncovered the <a href="http://www.tennantco.com/am-en/Pages/ProductDetails.aspx?item=ATLV">Tennant Green Machines ATLV 4300</a> All Terrain Litter Vacuum! From their product specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rid-on [sic] vacuum improves the image of your community with superior litter pick-up</li>
<li>Increase productivity by cleaning on all terrains: climb kerbs, navigate hills and clean along fence lines</li>
<li>Low centre of gravity design provides a stable machine ride to safely protect the operator</li>
</ul>
<p>Could this image improvement also apply to those who ride these devices? I could go for an image overhaul, I&#39;m just saying!</p>
<ul>
<li>48 in / 1,219 mm vacuum head provides a wide cleaning path to improve productivity</li>
<li>Ergonomic vacuum hose reaches up to 270 degrees to allow the operator to clean hard-to-reach areas without leaving the operator’s seat</li>
<li>Low centre of gravity, reliable disc brakes, and standard roll-over protection contribute to operator safety</li>
</ul>
<p>This ride on cleaning machine has disc brakes?! This ride on cleaning machine is better than some cars! Clearly, this really happy guy agrees:</p>

<p>Happy post #4300 everyone! Time for celebrations!</p>
