<p>Twitter&#39;s geo-specific censorship plan wasn&#39;t unforeseen. They&#39;re certainly not <a href="http://jilliancyork.com/2012/01/26/thoughts-on-twitters-latest-move/">above the law</a>. Still, with the scary new custom TLD registration rules, the undemocratically secretive ACTA nonsense, Google&#39;s decision to drop <em>Don&#39;t Be Evil&trade;</em>, you can understand why some of us are a little wary of censorship in 2012, and certainly of the uncanny timing of Twitter&#39;s announcement. Reads like a gigantic distraction to me.</p>
<p>So despite <a title="Wednesday 18th January 2012: Blacked out [this post] for SOPA et al" href="//rubenerd.com/sopa-blackout/">my reservations</a> regarding the effectiveness of blackouts, I was quiet on <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Rubenerd">@Rubenerd</a> for much of the day. The world was probably the better for it!</p>
