<p>I didn&#39;t intend for this to <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/dbs-skimmers/">be a series</a>, but here we are again! We heard of the <a title="Sunday 08th January 2012: DBS ATM skimmers" href="//rubenerd.com/dbs-atm-skimmers/">skimmer problems</a> with DBS ATMs, and the <a title="Thursday 12th January 2012: You can just skim this DBS ATM story" href="//rubenerd.com/dbs-skimmer-followup/">response</a> the bank garnered from customers. Now we&#39;re finding out what DBS is going to do about it.</p>

<p><cite>Photo from the <a href="http://www.dbs.com/annualreports/2010/default.htm">DBS 2010 Annual Report</a>. I&#39;ll bet their 2011 report will mention losses incurred from this incident. Maybe!</cite> </p>
<h3>Prevention is good, but…</h3>
<p>Channel NewsAsia <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1176795/1/.html">reported</a> on the basics, but for the real story we turn to the <a href="http://www.dbs.com/newsroom/Pages/default.aspx">DBS Newsroom</a> which inexplicably needs JavaScript enabled to work. How terribly frustrating!</p>
<p>If you&#39;re a cardholder you&#39;ll <a href="http://www.dbs.com/newsroom/newsreleases/default.aspx?NewsID=479&#038;Country=All">want to read the full report</a>, but this seems to be the primary action they&#39;re taking:</p>
<blockquote><p>All customers who have made overseas withdrawals using their ATM/ Debit cards at any point in time on or after 1 July 2011 will be able to continue to use their cards outside Singapore. However, they can also choose to block the overseas ATM cash withdrawal function at any DBS/POSB ATM, branch or by calling the DBS contact centre. For added protection, they can also choose to lower their daily cash withdrawal limit at any branch </p></blockquote>
<p>If I&#39;m parsing this correct, DBS are implementing an opt-in approach for overseas ATM banking. This would seem to be the opposite of what HSBC does; I handle some finances for my father, and in the case of his HSBC cards he&#39;s informed by SMS when overseas transactions occur. I think both serve their purpose, but the opt-in approach would be the most foolproof.</p>
<p>Maybe! Hey, I&#39;ve said that once before here. No wait, twice. Maybe. Ah, crap.</p>

<h3>Yes, but what about the hardware?</h3>
<p>While these preventitive measures are valuable, they don&#39;t address the underlying hardware issue: that ATMs in Singapore can have skimmers installed which record customer information. To that end, DBS offered some advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>Be Observant &#8211; If something about the ATM does not seem or &#8216;feel’ right, then stop your transaction and use another ATM. Do not remove any suspicious devices from the ATM, as it may be under surveillance by fraudsters.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll be looking out for another followup press release. In the meantime, I&#39;d better check that I&#39;ve used my POSB ATM card in Sydney since July last year; I&#39;m pretty sure I haven&#39;t!</p>
