<p>Observing a minute&#39;s silence for those affected by the horrible Japanese Tsunami last year. And a second minute for Douglas Adams on what would be his birthday. <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/stephenfry/status/178760667438907393">From Stephen Fry</a>, who could almost be speaking for the victims as much as Douglas:</p>
