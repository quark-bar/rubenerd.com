<blockquote><p>Technorati will need to verify that you are an author of the blog by looking for a unique code. Please put the following short code BWSUEMRM6QG8 within a new blog post and publish it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I already <a href="//rubenerd.com/technorati/">did this in 2005</a>, but somehow <a href="http://technorati.com/blogs/rubenerd.com">Rub&eacute;nerd.com</a> posts stopped appearing there recently. When I attempted to update the site details, it asked me to re-verify. Done and done, and I mean done.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I&#39;m using the same Technorati logo image on this post as I did in 2005. It has the same awful, mangled <a href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/page0_blog_entry19_1.gif">file name</a> that my old CMS gave it at the time. True facts. Any of this helping to verify my site, Technorati?</p>
