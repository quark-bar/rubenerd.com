<p>I&#39;ve been so thorougly soaked with assignments and work over the last week or so, I&#39;ve barely had time to eat let alone blog! To break the silence on this glorious Saturday evening, I thought I&#39;d share this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRrV7oMcmEY">ridiculously amazing</a> rendition of Avalon by one of my all time favourite jazz/swing musicians <a href="http://www.johnpizzarelli.com/index2.html">John Pizzarelli</a>!</p>
<p>By all accounts that guitar should have <strong>CAUGHT FIRE</strong>! Jazz and big band forever :&#39;D</p>
