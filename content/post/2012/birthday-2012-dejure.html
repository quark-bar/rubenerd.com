<p>I had studies practically all day today (hence my <a title="Monday 26th March 2012: My de facto birthday 2012!" href="//rubenerd.com/birthday-2012/">de facto birthday!</a>), but I met up with my awesome sister for dinner at the Yum Yum Cha restaurant in Chinatown for a birthday dinner! We had a real heart to heart talk about all kind of things and laughed a lot :)</p>
<p>Out of the blue, she surprised me with a metal wristband for the iPod Nano watch she bought me last year, and the present my old man left me at home turned out to be a brand new Tokina 100mm f/2.8 Macro lens! The thought that went into those presentsâ€¦ speechless.</p>
<p>The iPod Nano watch I&#39;ll be wearing every day, problem is now I&#39;ll want to take more photos when I should be studying. A great concern!</p>
<p>Also got more birthday hugs from dear friends, and an <a href="http://alonelyseptember.org/happy-birthday-ruben/">extraordinarily friendly post</a> from my friend Sebastian. Speechless, again. Thank you so much :&#39;D</p>
