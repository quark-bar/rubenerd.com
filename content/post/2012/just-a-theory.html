<p>Jokes aside, it&#39;s easy to see how people get &quot;theories&quot; and &quot;scientific theories&quot; confused. Conjecture satisfies the former, the latter follows strict rules. So humble and precise are scientists that even the most accepted theory isn&#39;t referred to as fact. Of all the reasons why I&#39;m an <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/atheism/">atheist</a>, that&#39;s high on my list.</p>
