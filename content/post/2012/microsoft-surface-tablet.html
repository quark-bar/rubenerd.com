<p>During a wondrous product keynote with lasers, Microsoft announced plans for their latest tablet device. Here are some thoughts!</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/03/05/microsofts-courier-digital-journal-exclusive-pictures-and-de/">According to Engadget</a> that live blogged the event, the new product will a size niche between tablet computers such as the iPad, and paper based devices. They also hinted at its functionality.</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re told Courier will function as a &#8220;digital journal,&#8221; and it’s designed to be seriously portable: it’s under an inch thick, weighs a little over a pound, and isn’t much bigger than a 5&#215;7 photo when closed. That’s a lot smaller than we expected.</p></blockquote>
<p>A compelling size. An iPad is lovey, but can&#39;t fit in my cargo pants.</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<p>In a fit of common sense which I&#39;m relieved to see, it seems Microsoft has admitted nobody really wants to run Windows 8 on tablets, and instead the Courier will run a mobile OS.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rather than Windows 7, we’re told the Courier is built on Tegra 2 and runs on the same OS as the Zune HD, Pink, and Windows Mobile 7 Series, which we’re taking to mean Windows CE 6.</p></blockquote>
<p>As to the UI itself, Microsoft seem to be taking a different tack to iOS and Android by fundamentally rethinking how users input data with a pen-based interface. It&#39;ll even fit in well with their recent Barnes and Noble acquisition.</p>
<blockquote><p>[..] centered around drawing and writing, with built-in handwriting recognition and a corresponding web site that allows access to everything entered into the device in a blog-like format complete with comments. [..] it looks like the Courier will also serve as Microsoft’s e-book device, with a dedicated ecosystem centered around reading.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Engadget said, it &quot;sounds spectacular&quot;! Microsoft have a history of demoing and announcing products that never ship (so called vapourware), but I have every hope this won&#39;t be one of those devices.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be keeping my eye out. Admittedly, Microsoft haven&#39;t excited me for a very long time, but I&#39;d buy one of these in a heartbeat.</p>
