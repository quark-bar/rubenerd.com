<p><a href="http://afr.com/p/technology/optus_and_vodafone_team_up_in_mobile_S40QdSIc7aKDKjP06bq4IP">John McDuling for the Australian Financial Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Optus and Vodafone Hutchison Australia have signed a deal to share and build critical infrastructure to boost coverage and bolster their networks for the launch of superfast mobile services. [..] Optus will be granted access to around 1000 additional sites [..]</p></blockquote>
<p>My sister gets excellent coverage on Vodafone in Earlwood, but Optus is bad enough to be non-existent. Assuming this gets ACCC approval, this would be the quickest fix for our area! Something tells me I shouldn&#39;t get my hopes up too much though.</p>
