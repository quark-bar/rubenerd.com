<p>If you&#39;re as much a fan of the soon-to-be-ending <a href="http://5by5.tv/hypercritical">Hypercritical</a> podcast as I am, <a href="https://5by5.wufoo.com/forms/hypercritical-tshirt/">put your vote in</a> for the shirt design you&#39;ll end up buying. Or shirts, as the case may be. </p>
<p>In an entirely unrelated question, how much does it cost to frame a shirt? Asking for a friend.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The poll is now closed.</p>
