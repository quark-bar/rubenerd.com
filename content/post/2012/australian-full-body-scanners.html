<p>We all know now that Australia is going to introduce those full body scanners. Here&#39;s an example of how the press is reporting on the issue.</p>

<h3>Hey, citizen!</h3>
<p>Article <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/body-scanners-to-be-installed-across-australian-international-airports-20120205-1qzdz.html">from the AAP</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Body scanners are soon to be installed across all Australian international airports as part of a government plan to beef up anti-terrorism measures.</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe the term they&#39;re looking for is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_theater">security theater</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Aside from those with serious medical conditions, any passenger who refuses may be denied the right to board their flight.</p></blockquote>
<p>So that means Australia&#39;s border controls are worse than the United States? There you can opt-out and be felt up instead of being unnecessarily exposed to carcinogenic radiation. The story makes no mention of this; clearly some research of my own will be needed.</p>
<h3>Oh but it’s okay, because…</h3>
<blockquote><p>Transport Minister Anthony Albanese says there is no need for passengers to be concerned about modesty, as the machines only produce a generic outline, with no defining features.</p></blockquote>
<p>Modesty is the <strong>least</strong> of my concerns in this case. With a history of cancer and leukemia in my family, I don&#39;t want to go through a machine spewing radiation for no reason. And there is no reason, these machines <strong>don&#39;t work</strong>. </p>
<p>All this talk about modesty and privacy is an absolute red herring. Albanese and this AAP reporter are guilty of either not doing their jobs properly, misdirection or lying. I&#39;m not sure which of the options is scarier. </p>
<blockquote><p>The technology was trialled by 23,000 volunteers in Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were queueing up. People wanted to try out this new technology,&#8221; Mr Albanese said.</p></blockquote>
<p>People queue up to buy cigarettes too, what&#39;s your point?</p>
<p>It won&#39;t make any difference, but Mr Albanese&#39;s department will be receiving a polite but stern letter and phone call from me in the coming days. I will be researching this further, and posting more about it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Sydney Morning Herald should do a better job reporting on legitimate concerns, rather than just republishing a report that heaps on nothing but praise and distractions. It&#39;s embarrasing to read!</p>
