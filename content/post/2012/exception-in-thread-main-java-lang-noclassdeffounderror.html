<p>In response to my <a href="//rubenerd.com/java-enhanced-for-loops/" title="Sunday 18th March 2012: Java enhanced for loops for UTS peeps">previous Java post</a>, I got a DM on Twitter from another university student asking if I&#39;d come across the above error before. Often I do, when I&#39;m programming in a dazed stupor at 3am, and I&#39;ve done this:</p>
<pre>
% javac Something.java
% java Something.class
</pre>
<p>Instead of this:</p>
<pre>
% javac Something.java
% java Something
</pre>
<p>The error can be caused by any number of factors, but 99% of the time it&#39;s because of this. Much hair ripping has resulted from it!</p>
