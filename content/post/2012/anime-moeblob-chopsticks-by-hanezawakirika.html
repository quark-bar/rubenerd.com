<p>So last night we were Twittering my attempts to eat pizza with chopsticks. I also unabashedly invented the title of <em><a href="http://utsanime.net/">UTS Anime Club Moeblob Liaison Officer</a></em> for myself. Somehow, these two conversations folded into one, and we decided if I were to have a badge it should be of Mugi-chanâ€¦ eating with chopsticks.</p>
<p>Needless to say, our art director wasted no time sketching up a concept, after I&#39;d already gone to sleep! That she could do that at an ungodly hour of the night and have it look like the character so much it&#39;s uncanny only confirms the fact the Anime club voted for the right person for art director. I&#39;m just saying :)</p>
