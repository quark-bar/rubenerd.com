<p>A cross post from my <a href="http://utsanime.net/2012/09/relaxing-porco-piano-for-your-music-monday-evening/">latest entry</a> on the Anime@UTS club blog ^_^</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>When <a href="http://utsanime.net/author/ruby/">your humble blogger</a> here wrote (no wait, typed!) his last Music Monday post about one of the <a href="http://utsanime.net/2012/09/music-monday-when-one-inuyasha-isnt-enough/">themes from InuYasha</a>, fellow <a href="http://utsanime.net/">Anime@UTS</a> club member <a href="http://utsanime.net/author/kirishima/">Kirishima</a> was so happy to have some classic anime here again, we&#39;ve decided to dedicate more posts to this time period in Japanese animation! Well, the music in this time period of Japanese animation. With this in mind, let&#39;s explore this rather nostalgic (and porky) tune.</p>
<h3>It’s fitting for this time of day!</h3>
<p>While intending to write this during the morning, a certain member of the anime club who had volunteered to write the post you&#39;re reading now fell into a predictable trap that snags most university students: <strong>university work!</strong> It&#39;s as if your author is going to university for reasons other than being an active member of the Anime@UTS club or something! How stupid is that?</p>
<p>In any event, in keeping with the time of evening this post is being written, we&#39;re taking a more relaxed tone with one of my favourite theme songs &#8212; for any series in any medium from any country ever &#8212; of all time.</p>
<h3>Pigging out on blog space here</h3>
<p>Everyone remembers their first <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?p=21">Ghibli</a> movie. Bar none. Well, other than those who don&#39;t frequent bars. Like me. Not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Me">Me</a>, me. Stop putting words in my mouth. There&#39;s a pun about pork in there somewhere.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll admit I watched most of Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s creative genius fairly recently, but the one movie of his I saw many, many years ago was Porco Rosso. It was one of those times where I didn&#39;t make the mental connection until years later, much like I watched Star Trek Voyager for years before realising I was a part of the fandom and went back and retroactively watched The Next Generation and and… I think we&#39;ll stop there.</p>
<p>Behold, a relaxing piano rendition of the ED from <em><a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/416/Porco_Rosso">Porco Rosso</a></em>, the classic 1992 movie that&#39;s now 20 years old. I suddenly feel ancient :&#39;)</p>

<p>So beautiful! I&#39;ve always been a sucker for piano, but the melody and subtle hook in <em>Toki ni wa Mukashi no Hanashi wo</em> (<em>Once in a While, Talk of the Old Days</em>) gets me every… single… time. MANLY TEARS :&#39;)</p>
<p>Of course, I would be remiss if I also didn&#39;t include this video of Eminence performing the tune at SMASH! 2007, right here in Sydney! </p>

<p>One of these days I&#39;ll have to write a full length blog post about Porco Rosso, even after seeing plenty of other Ghibli films, I&#39;m pretty sure this one is still my favourite. Though that&#39;s not to say it doesn&#39;t have some pretty stiff competition!</p>
<p>Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;m off to dream about my childhood and blue skies to the sound of gentle music :)</p>
