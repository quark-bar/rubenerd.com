<p>Given I only have a limited amount of time back home, I&#39;ve been attempting to cram as much stuff into each day as I can! My limited funds means I&#39;ve also abstained from any cabs, and taken the MRT. It&#39;s fast, cheap and clean, but sometimes takes a little longer than a taxi would ;D</p>
<p>Upshot of this: I&#39;m too tired each evening to write up a post, and publish all my SLR shots. I&#39;ll do this when I get back to Sydney.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
