<p><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/World/EDC120328-0000151/Australia-to-welcome-250-US-Marines-next-month">From TODAYOnline</a>, a Singaporean news site:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first 250 US Marines will arrive next month in northern Australia where a permanent joint training hub will be based. [..] In November, the United States and Australia announced plans to send more US military aircraft and to rotate up to 2,500 Marines through the northern city of Darwin to better protect American interests across Asia.</p></blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re not evening hiding who this arrangement benefits any more.</p>
