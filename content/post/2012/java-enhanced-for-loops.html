<p>A very good friend of mine at UTS and on The Twitters asked about enhanced for loops in Java. I think he understands what&#39;s going on now, but just in case I&#39;m putting an example up here!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the real world, we don’t really use primitive arrays in Java anymore, but given UTS still teaches them for some reason, they’ll do for our example here!
</p>
</li>
<li>For some reason I got into the habit of including the above picture from Railgun into my programming posts. Presumably because there’s a laptop involved, and I can’t stand dry posts without pictures! But I digress.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Regular for loops</h3>
<p>Say we wanted to create an application that stores a list of moeblob character names into an array, then print each name out to the screen.</p>
<pre>
public class EnhancedForLoop
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    String[] keion = new String[3];
    keion[0] = "Mugi";
    keion[1] = "Yui";
    keion[2] = "Azusa";

    for (int count = 0; count < keion.length; count++)
    {
      System.out.println(keion[count]);
    }
  }
}</pre>
<p>As you can see, we created an array and populated it with character names. We then used a for loop and printed each character by referencing them one by one.</p>
<h3>There's a simpler way!</h3>
<p>There are circumstances where a traditional for loop would be preferred (and needed!), but if all you want to do is traverse an array one by one, there&#39;s a simpler way!</p>
<pre>
for (String name : keion)
{
  System.out.println(name);
}</pre>
<p>In this loop, instead of referencing each array element by a number, it traverses the array one by one for us, and <strong>stores the current element in a temporary variable</strong>. In this case, each element in our &quot;<code>keion</code>&quot; array gets put into our temporary &quot;<code>String name</code>&quot; variable! :D</p>
<p>As you can probably tell, for going through an array one by one, an enhanced for loop is:</p>
<ul>
<li>shorter and easier to write</li>
<li>the statements in the loop are easier to read, make more sense</li>
<li>you don't need to know how many elements there are</li>
<li>you don't need to do any maths!</li>
</ul>
<h3>These kinds of loops are common</h3>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;ve done any scripting, but enhanced for loops are huge in languages like Perl, Ruby and Python. My personal favourite is the former ^_^</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

my @keion = qw/Mugi Yui Azusa/;

foreach my $name (@keion) {
    print("$namen");
}</pre>
