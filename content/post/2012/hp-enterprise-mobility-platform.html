<p>I read this last week but forgot to mention it! <a href="http://www.fiercemobileit.com/story/hp-launches-enterprise-mobility-app-store/2012-04-18">Wayne Rash writing for Fierce Mobile IT</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.fiercemobileit.com/story/hp-launches-enterprise-mobility-app-store/2012-04-18"><p>HP is launching an enterprise mobility platform that will let wireless carriers provide app stores tailored for enterprise users. [..]</p>
<p>The Enterprise Mobility Platform includes the Enterprise Mobile App Store that lets enterprises create, certify, distribute and manage mobile versions of company apps. The apps would be hosted at the carrier site and the HP app store would provide a portal for employee use.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds like a great idea for simplifying distribution and updating clients, as many of their competitors have realised. Frankly I&#39;m surprised it took them this long!</p>
