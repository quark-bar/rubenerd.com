<blockquote><p>It’s January 11, and @Rubenerd already has 15 posts. Is he sure he isn’t doing a Post A Day 2012? :D</p></blockquote>
<p>An astute observation good sir, and I&#39;m flattered you counted! To prevent temptation though, I missed out on the first two days of January, to relieve the instinctive pressure to continue the <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/postaday2011">PostADay2011</a> challenge into 2012.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not to say I won&#39;t be posting frequently any more! For example, aside from your tweet, this post had little substance to it whatsoever. Quite literally, I only mentioned the word <em>&quot;substance&quot;</em> twice.</p>
