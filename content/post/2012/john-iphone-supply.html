<blockquote><p>It is the notion that the phones will be in short supply that attracts my attention, though. This is because the whole idea screams &#8220;marketing ploy!&#8221; </p></blockquote>

<blockquote cite="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-25/apple-use-of-thin-display-seen-driving-iphone-5-supply-shortfall.html"><p>&#8220;Apple is facing significant production constraints due to a move toward in-cell display technology [from LG and Japan Display],&#8221; Ben Reitzes, an analyst at Barclays, wrote in a research note yesterday. &#8220;Apple is struggling to keep up with demand.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The popular myth that Apple intentionally causes supply bottlenecks is conjecture at best, and belies a lack of understanding about manufacturing. My two cents, which I&#39;d put towards buying an iPhone 5 if I weren&#39;t looking to head back to BlackBerry.</p>
