<p>Patrick Wintour <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jun/21/assad-clemency-syria-peace-talks">reporting for The Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Britain and America are willing to offer the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, safe passage – and even clemency – as part of a diplomatic push to convene a UN-sponsored conference in Geneva on political transition in Syria.</p></blockquote>
<p>And yet Julian Assange, who has not been charged or convicted of any crimes, is asking Equador to protect him from Britain and America. This whole farce would be hilarious if it weren&#39;t so tragic.</p>
