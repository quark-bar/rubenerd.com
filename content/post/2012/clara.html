<p>Forgive me for this post, I haven&#39;t written anything like this before!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>So I was stressed from assignments. The subjects I have this semester combined have more workload than I had when I was working full time in a corporate office. I&#39;d say almost double, as a conservative estimate. You can tell from the sudden drop off in the frequency of blog posts here!</p>
<p>Clara saw that I was stressed out, so she drew me Yuki and emailed it to me. A few days ago, she gave me the original in a little wooden frame to keep. She&#39;s sewn me plushie whales, snow bunnies and birds. She&#39;s held my hand, squeezed my arm and given me hugs. She&#39;s pretended to find my jokes hilarious! She&#39;s written me letters, typed me emails, and commuted from Hornsby to Bardwell Park to see me. She&#39;s shared udon with me, and long evening walks. She&#39;s gentle with me, loves me and respects me, no strings attached. At times, I wake up and can&#39;t believe it.</p>
<p>I can tell she&#39;s stressed now too, so I&#39;m posting this here to say what a wonderful, talented, creative, smart, generous, considerate, cute, beautiful person she is. Regardless of whether she believes me or not, I&#39;m the luckiest guy in the world.</p>
<p>I&#39;m so excited to be spending my future with you, Clara. I love you.</p>
