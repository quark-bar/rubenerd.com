<p><a href="http://www.allmusic.com/album/one-night-with-you-r247348">Michael G. Nastos</a> reviewing John Pizzarelli&#39;s 1996 album <em>One Night with You</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you like your contemporary jazz crooners smooth and sweet, then likely John Pizzarelli is your main man [..]</p></blockquote>
<p>Aww! I&#39;ll admit it, as a kid his name was enough to reel me in. His distinctive jazz, big band style was what kept me listening ever since. In my world of ripped audio and iDevices, his physical CDs grace my precious shelf space with Michael Franks :).</p>
<p>Ironically, I&#39;ll bet I&#39;m of the few people who heard of him <em>before</em> his famous dad.</p>
