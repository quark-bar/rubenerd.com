<p>I have no idea what this post contained. At some point during the myriad of <abbr title="content management systems">CMS</abbr> changes that <em>Rub√©nerd</em> has had over the years, it lost its content. All I have is this title.</p>

<p>I assume its to do with Malaysians being busted for unlicenced software? Or maybe something Edward Snowden would use. Who knows? What a mystery.</p>
