<p>Towards the end of <a href="http://www.afr.com/p/lifestyle/review/climate_change_denial_not_just_for_sFAw16a7QU34KIj2tmN4eJ">his article</a> in the Australian Financial Review:</p>
<blockquote><p>In so many areas, the left is being forced to deal with the byproducts of its own success â€“ achievements within the capitalist system that have generated knock-on problems.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, there were two great socialist goals: widespread economic ownership and universal education. The first has produced a highly materialistic society (undermining traditional left-wing values of compassion and collectivism), while the second has, perversely enough, encouraged anti-enlightenment on climate change.</p></blockquote>
<p>He argues with greater education, we&#39;ve become dabblers in many fields without becoming experts, which predisposes us to be sceptical of traditional sources of authority, such as the scientific community. Interesting idea.</p>
