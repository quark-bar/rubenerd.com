<p>Remember all those <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/dbs-skimmers/">DBS ATM skimmer problems</a> I talked about earlier this year? Seems that it hasn&#39;t affected their <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC120427-0000115/DBS-posts-record-quarterly-profit">bottom line</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>SINGAPORE &#8211; DBS Group, Southeast Asia’s largest bank, posted a record quarterly profit that beat analysts’ expectations due to higher loan margins and trading income, and was bullish in its outlook.</p></blockquote>
<p>The money is all in Asia now folks!</p>
<p>Ironically, I&#39;m thinking of moving to <a href="http://ocbc.com.sg/global/main/index.shtm">OCBC</a>. During some recent family adventures with a handful of banks, they&#39;ve been by far the most tolerable. As far as banks go, that&#39;s high praise!</p>
