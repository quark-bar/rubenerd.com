<p>I get one lift home, and I leave an impression! Sort of. From my friend Emily on <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/emi_wong/statuses/184952410295377922">The Twitters</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>My dad was like, &#8220;I just realised, I don’t know what this Ruben guy looks like &#8211; just that he’s blonde, tall and kind of skinny.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>To the right is an artist&#39;s conception based on that description.</p>
