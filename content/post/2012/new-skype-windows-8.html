<p>From Skype&#39;s <a href="http://blogs.skype.com/en/2012/10/skype_for_windows8.html">The Big Blog</a>. I&#39;ve seen bigger.</p>
<blockquote><p>Skype for Windows 8 is almost here and we are incredibly excited by this important new version of Skype. This is our big step forward together with Microsoft to introduce a completely new Skype experience, which is designed to be always on, immersive, effortless and fun to use.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be fair, there are things in Windows 8 you can&#39;t do on other platforms, just as there are things in iOS you can&#39;t do on Windows 8. Still, prioritising one platform for a multi-platform client is what we feared when Microsoft bought Skype.</p>
<p>I used the word platform four times in this post. Please mind the gap.</p>
