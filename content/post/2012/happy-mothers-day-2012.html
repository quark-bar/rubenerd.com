<p>Hey Mummy, remember that Mother&#39;s Day I carried a tray of food into your bedroom loudly singing Dean Martin, and you threw a book at me in horror? Or the time you flipped an entire plate of mie goreng onto your head on our last holiday, only to have you say in a sheepish little voice &quot;oh… shit!&quot; Or the time we just sat at that Starbucks in Paragon giggling for hours on end while people around us tried to figure out why? Good times! :)</p>
<p>I love you Mummy. Being silly just isn&#39;t the same without you.</p>
