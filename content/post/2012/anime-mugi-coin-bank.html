<p>From AmiAmi.com, we have this <a href="http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/detail?gcode=CGD2-25497&#038;page=top%2Fsearch%2Flist%3Fs_cate1%3D194%24s_saleitem%3D1%24pagemax%3D100%24getcnt%3D0%24pagecnt%3D2">Mitsumetronics K-On! Photo Frame Coin Bank</a>! You can have any of the girls from <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/k-on/">HTT</a>, but naturally you&#39;d want to get this one ^^.</p>
