<p>As an early Christmas present, our Optus home ADSL connection has decided to throttle us down for no good reason. After cruising at a paltry 3012kbps for a few weeks, we&#39;re now hovering between 100-320kbps. Rebooting the modem does nothing other than make us wait between 1-2 hours for it to re-establish a connection.</p>
<p>I looked up some old bills, and confirmed we got faster speeds from our SingTel ISDN connection in 1997, when I was 11. Hollow jokes aside, me thinks I&#39;ll be on hold with Optus for much of tomorrow to establish what&#39;s going on.</p>
<p>Maybe this is just a ploy to make their Optus 3G network seem better around Earlwood. Sneaky.</p>
