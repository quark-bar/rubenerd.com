<p>Congrats to PSY for his <a rel="bookmark" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0">1 billionth view</a>! I suspect a large number of those are people watching the video more than once, but that in and of itself is also epic. Oppa!</p>
<p>I loved <em><a rel="me" href="//rubenerd.com/tag/gangnam-style/">Gangnam Style</a></em> when I <a rel="me" href="//rubenerd.com/gundam-gangnam-style/">first watched it</a> back in August, and when I saw <a rel="me" href="//rubenerd.com/psy-gangnam-style-sydney/">PSY perform live in Sydney</a> in October, and I still love it now. If you hate it, have fun with that.</p>
<p>Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;m off to perform some pelvic thrusts in a lift. Or wear a neon yellow suit and large sunglasses. I haven&#39;t decided yet.</p>
