<p>Finally, I had the time today to create a new article for my beloved <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Jazz">WikiProject Jazz</a> group on Wikipedia.</p>
<blockquote><p><a style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Night:_Live">Summer Night: Live</a> is a live jazz album by the Chick Corea Akoustic Band trio, featuring Chick Corea, John Patitucci and Dave Weckl. Recorded during a concert in Belgrade in 1987, it was released with Jazz Door, the former recorded and live jazz record label.</p>
<p>The set contained jazz standards from Miles Davis and John Coltrane, as well as several original quartets by Corea.</p></blockquote>
<p>I could see why Wikipedians had skipped this particular album in Chick&#39;s discography; information about it online is scant. I was just lucky that we had the physical album here to reference! Oh yeah, and the music is friggen good too.</p>
