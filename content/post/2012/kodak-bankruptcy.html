<p>From <a href="http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0119/kodak-business.html">RTÃ‰ News</a>, a credible site because of the accented &eacute;.</p>

<blockquote><p>US camera pioneer Eastman Kodak, which brought photography to the masses over a century ago, has filed for bankruptcy. [..] it has been struggling to keep pace with the digital age [..]</p></blockquote>
<p>The irony is Kodak engineers invented the digital camera, the very device that hastened its demise. Where its competitors succeeded, Kodak faltered. It&#39;s a real shame, few companies have had such an impact on people&#39;s memories and on the state of technology, research and design.</p>
<p>As an aside, I&#39;ve noticed a correlation between failing companies and &quot;modernised&quot; logo changes. Kodak discarded their classic red K in 2006.</p>
