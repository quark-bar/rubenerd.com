<p>Facebook is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/31/facebook-ipo-quietly-confident">about to go public</a>. Typically what happens with such deals is the prospective public company enlists the assitance of an underwriter, who sells the shares on their behalf. Only a select few are given a crack at the first rounds before the stock is sold to the general public. Understandably, those who get in first make instant millions. Nice work if you can get it.</p>
<p>Sincerely, I&#39;ve got to hand it to Mark Zuckerberg. Since starting Facebook to get the phone numbers of girls he was too embarrased to ask (darn, why didn&#39;t I think of that?), he&#39;s arguably demonstrated nothing but contempt for his users, yet here&#39;s his project on the cusp of earning billions. Meanwhile, to quote but one example, Julian Assange remains under house arrest. Think about that.</p>
