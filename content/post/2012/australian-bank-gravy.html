<p>From the Australian <a href="http://mobile.twitter.com/abcnews/status/163917730427314176">@ABCNews</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://mobile.twitter.com/abcnews/status/163917730427314176"><p>Big four banks warned they may be downgraded by Fitch because of reliance on offshore funding</p></blockquote>
<p>The Coalition and its sympathisers regularly take credit for the reforms instituted by Hawke and Keating, but what&#39;s really kept the coal-fired Australian juggernaut moving are mineral exports to booming markets, and a ready pool of cheap foreign credit. Banks could take money from depressed markets with low interest rates, then charge Australians local rates. Obviously, this disparity fuelled a gravy train likeâ€¦ a train powered by gravy. Mmm, gravy!</p>
<p>As for ratings agencies: well, I&#39;ve <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/ratings-agencies/">voiced my opinion of them</a> before, especially with regards to Ireland.</p>
