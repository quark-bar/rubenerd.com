<p>Installing extensions into a new SeaMonkey install this morning, I got quite a shock!</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/seamonkey/addon/simple-clocks/">Simple Clocks :: Add-ons for SeaMonkey</a><br />
This add-on has been removed by its author. </p></blockquote>
<p>As someone with friends in multiple timezones, Simple Clocks was the <em>simplest</em> way to see at a glance whether or not I&#39;d be waking anyone up with my tweets, newsgroup messages and the like. It&#39;s a shame the developer couldn&#39;t keep it going.</p>
<p>I guess it&#39;s back to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/seamonkey/addon/foxclocks/">FoxClocks</a>; another excellent plugin but with extra features I don&#39;t really need.</p>
