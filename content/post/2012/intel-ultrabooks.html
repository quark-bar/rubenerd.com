<p><a href="http://gigaom.com/mobile/intels-dilemma-whose-problem-do-ultrabooks-solve/">Kevin C. Tofel asks on GigaOM</a> what problem Intel&#39;s Ultrabooks intend to solve, and asserts its to solve Intel&#39;s problem. Worth a read.</p>
<p>For me, an ultrabook would fill the niche between my souped up desktop at home, and my smartphone. As a &quot;power user&quot; and developer with very specialised software requirements, I need the lightest possible machine with decent battery life, a full sized keyboard and the ability to run desktop applications. My back can&#39;t take carrying a 15 inch MacBook Pro any more. iPads and Kindle Fires can&#39;t fill that roll, nor are they intended to.</p>
<p>The problem for Intel, and I think this fits into Kevin&#39;s argument, is that people like me (and perhaps you, if you read this blog!) are in the gradually shrinking minority.</p>
