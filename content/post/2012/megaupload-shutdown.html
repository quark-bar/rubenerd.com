<p>I don&#39;t know why people are so worked up about Megaupload being shut down. The case was ruled in the same manner that VCR manufacturers weren&#39;t found liable for the potential for copyright infringement, similarly ski equipment makers can&#39;t be sued if their balaclavas are used to rob banks. Finally, the operators were US citizens under US law.</p>
<p>Oh, wait.</p>
<p>The CAPTCHAS, forced waiting and hoops you had to jump through to start a download meant I rarely used Megaupload if I could avoid it. I can still appreciate this ruling as setting a dangerous precedent though.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> If true, the operators of SOPA will have to quicky <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/01/20/megaupload-may-be-trying-to-get-back-online-under-new-domain-name/?utm_source=rubenerd.com">get used to this</a>.</p>
