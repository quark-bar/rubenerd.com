<p>Was intrigued by this graphic from the Windows Live login screen. Arguably all three phones are displaying the same information for each message, and (barring the names) even the text is a similar size. Yet iOS and Android manage six to seven full previews, and WP only does four.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not arguing message counts and more efficient layouts automatically correlate with increased productivity or usability, but it&#39;d certainly cut down on time spent scrolling!</p>
