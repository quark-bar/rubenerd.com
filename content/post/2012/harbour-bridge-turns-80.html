<p><a class="transparent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/5921999894/" title="South Sydney Skyline by rubenerd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6009/5921999894_a1306175cc.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="South Sydney Skyline" /></a></p>
<p>I&#39;ve always been fascinated by iron structures, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_Tower">Eiffel Tower</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavenagh_Bridge">Cavenagh Bridge</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge">Sydney Harbour Bridge</a>. How these complicated, heavy structures could have been conceived and constructed without computer aided design (or even electronic calculators!) boggles my mind. Honestly!</p>
<p>For those interested, I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/sets/72157627160018110/">took a whole bunch of photos</a> around the bridge last year, including what I hoped were some more unconventional ones. </p>
<p>It also goes without saying that all the best things/people were opened/born in/around March. Ahem.</p>
