<p>As I mentioned in a <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p2319/">previous post</a>, if Australians were to vote in the American presidential elections, Obama would win with more than a 70% landslide. It&#39;s ironic then that in their respective articles written in the latest issue of <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/">Foreign Affairs</a> magazine, John McCain was the only candidate who mentions Australia. From an article written by <a href="http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,,24581879-5001030,00.html">Laurie Oakes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/photo.mccain.article.jpg" alt="John McCain" style="height:190px; width:140px; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px;" /> Both candidates have written in the respected Foreign Affairs magazine explaining their foreign policy. There are a number of references to Australia in McCain’s article.</p>
<p>He writes: &#8220;As president, I will tend carefully to our ever-stronger alliance with Australia, whose troops are fighting shoulder to shoulder with ours in Afghanistan.&#8221;</p>
<p>As well as acknowledging our importance as an ally, he also discusses Australia in a trade context.</p>
<p>McCain’s interest in Australia is long-standing. His father, a naval officer, was stationed in Perth for a time during World War II. And a key McCain foreign policy adviser, Richard Armitage, has for years been one of the best friends Australia has in Washington.</p></blockquote>
<p>By comparison, Barack Obama makes no mention whatsoever. I guess I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, though it is a tad disappointing.</p>
<blockquote><p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/photo.obama.article.jpg" alt="Barack Obama" style="height:190px; width:140px; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px;" /> One concern is that Obama appears to have little if any interest in this country.</p>
<p>[In] Obama’s foreign policy outline, Australia does not rate a single mention. It is as though we don’t exist.</p>
<p>Obama’s only connection with Australia seems to be that he stopped here on his way to Indonesia as a child.</p></blockquote>
