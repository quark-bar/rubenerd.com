<p>Ed Bott on ZD Net has <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/no-microsoft-is-not-spying-on-you-with-windows-10/">something to say</a> about those tinfoil-hat wearers:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I'm dead serious. There is apparently a growing and very vocal population of people who believe that Windows 10 is basically a 1984 telescreen come to life. They are convinced that with Windows 10 Microsoft has built a spying apparatus not seen since the height of the Cold War, scraping up every detail of your life and feeding it back to Redmond for who knows what nefarious purposes.</blockquote>

<p>Ah, <em>reductio ad absurdum</em>, it’s been a while. How are you? How’s the family?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, Microsoft is not spying on you with Windows 10</p>

<p>The Windows 10 privacy agreement doesn't mean Microsoft is secretly stealing the data from your hard disk. Where do people come up with these crazy ideas?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, this is awkward. Peter Bright <a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/08/even-when-told-not-to-windows-10-just-cant-stop-talking-to-microsoft/">wrote this earlier</a> this month on Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For example, even with Cortana and searching the Web from the Start menu disabled, opening Start and typing will send a request to www.bing.com to request a file called threshold.appcache which appears to contain some Cortana information, even though Cortana is disabled. The request for this file appears to contain a random machine ID that persists across reboots.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actions speak louder than words. I appreciate the irony of me typing that for you to read.</p>

<p>I have no interest in running Windows 10, but it’s a bellweather. And fortunately, there are people who’ve taken the time to <a href="https://github.com/WindowsLies/BlockWindows">write tools to combat it</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>BlockWindows: Stop Windows 7 through 10 Nagging and Spying updates, Tasks, IPs, and services. Works with Windows 7 through 10</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Darn those little tinfoil hatters, why do they have to ruin it for the big people?</p>
