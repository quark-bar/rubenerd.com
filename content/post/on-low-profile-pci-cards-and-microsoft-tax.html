<p>While I love Apple computers and use my MacBook Pro probably more than any other machine I own, I also love putting together machines myself for eight critical reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It’s cheaper</li>
<li>I choose everything, no need for compromises</li>
<li>I don’t ever have to pay the Microsoft tax</li>
<li>Microsoft doesn’t get any money with bundled Windows</li>
<li>I’m not supporting Microsoft</li>
<li>I can install FreeBSD or NetBSD from the beginning</li>
<li>Much easier to upgrade</li>
<li>I don’t give any money to Microsoft</li>
</ol>
<p>The latest machine I&#39;ve put together is assembled in a slimline MicroATX tower case to make it easier to take to Adelaide when I go back to study, plus it takes up much less space on my already critically full desk.</p>
<p>The downside is because it&#39;s so slim, the PCI and PCI express slots are only <em>half the width</em>. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=low%20profile%20pci%20cards">Doing a bit of research</a> it seems for this machine at least I&#39;ll be limited to using &quot;half height&quot; or &quot;low profile&quot; cards. They certainly do look strange!</p>

<p>It&#39;s less of a concern for this machine because I&#39;m using it primarily for raw number crunching and compiling large amounts of crap, so I&#39;m just using the onboard graphics. Plus, the board has inbuilt FireWire 400 ports, gigabit ethernet and a generous number of USBs… I&#39;ll probably need another gigabit ethernet port before anything else.</p>
<p>Anyone know where you can get a low profile PCI express gigabit ethernet card? ;-)</p>
