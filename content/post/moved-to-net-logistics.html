<p>I just finished the transition from <a href="http://segpub.net/">SegPub</a> to <a href="http://netlogistics.com.au/">Net Logistics</a>, as you can tell from my terribly sophisticated line-up of icons above!</p>

<h3>What colour is <em>whoa?</em></h3>
<p>I had my new account activated in less than an hour after I made my first monthly payment. In less than 30 minutes I had my private/public keys for SSH/SFTP swapped and usable, six years of blog posts restored in a new database, six years of images uploaded through SFTP, WordPress uploaded and installed and all my custom .htaccess crap implemented.</p>
<p>Good heavens, the difference in performance is <strong>amazing</strong>, its like someone shoved rockets up <a href="http://rubenerd.com/">my blog</a> and <a href="http://rubenschade.com/">bidness card</a> sites&#39; arses. I could have phrased that better.</p>
<h3>This heading is also entirely pointless</h3>
<p>I get the feeling I&#39;m going to like it here. Thanks for all your help Martin, Tarinder and Alicia A. Automation. They&#39;re so cute, they even name their bots. And they operate in Australia and Singaporeâ€¦ just like me. <em>sniffles</em></p>
<p>If something isn&#39;t working, leave a comment here and I&#39;ll patch it up. In return, I might start blogging about things that have nothing to do with web hosts again.</p>
<p>Who knows, I might be able to host my assignments <strong>reliably</strong> this semester so I don&#39;t get failed for them!</p>
