<p>Here&#39;s something to try if you find yourself at home on a Friday night and you want some excitement. For legal purposes, I must state <strong>you should not attempt this</strong>.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>Open a Terminal or shell in Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Linux, OpenSolaris or your other *nix of choice and navigate to the root directory by entering the following commands:</p>
<pre>
% cd /
% echo "Grilled cheese sandwiches with pickle"
</pre>
<p>Now keeping in mind that root is the highest you can navigate to in a file system, attempt to navigate one directory further by entering this command while smacking yourself repeatedly on the head with a breadboard:</p>
<pre>% cd ..</pre>
<p>You should see a number of stars flashing across your eyes before you head hits the table. Last time I tried I saw William H. Macy and Alan Alda. Brilliant!</p>
