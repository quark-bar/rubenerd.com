<p>I&#39;ve been told by people that the reason why Apple didn&#39;t include FireWire in their lastest MacBook computers was because they were phasing out support for a so called legacy port and that most video cameras and external hard drives use USB as well, amongst other reasons which I <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p2291/">thoroughly debunked in a previous post</a>.</p>
<p>Well we finally may have the real reason for why Apple removed the FireWire 400 port from the MacBook. As it turns out, it might not have been a decision by them after all, but one by NVidia who designed the new GeForce 9400M integrated chipset and graphics chip which the new MacBook uses.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the kicker: according to several sites I&#39;ve been reading, this chip was designed without a FireWire controller.</p>
<blockquote><p>
The GeForce 9400M does not include a Firewire controller. When asked, Rene Hass mentioned that during the design of this chips, this function was not part of the feature list.<br />

</p></blockquote>
<p>This seems to change my perceptions somewhat. Given Intel&#39;s lackluster onboard graphics, I can understand Apple&#39;s decision to move to a NVidia&#39;s chipset and graphics solution, especially in a computer like the MacBook. I can&#39;t help but think though that they could have at least included a separate FireWire controller, granted they are substantially bigger than controllers for USB, but if my Sony Vaio PCG-C1VM ultraportable from 2001 could include one there&#39;s no reason why Apple in 2008 couldn&#39;t.</p>
