<p><a href="http://statestats.appspot.com/">StateStats</a> is a web site service that allows you to analyze the number Google search queries made in different states in the United States, relative to the state with the most searches. You can also correlate the results to a series of metrics such as latitude, life expectancy, age and income. While my Orwellian warning senses are tingling a bit, it is fun to mess around with, even if the correlations really don&#39;t mean much.</p>
<p>For example, if you searched for <a href="http://statestats.appspot.com/?q=Singapore">Singapore</a> you were more likely to live in California (the relative index) followed by New York, Hawaii, New Jersey, the District of Columbia and Massachusetts:</p>

<cite>Singapore Google search query results</cite></p>
<p>If you did a search for <a href="http://statestats.appspot.com/?q=Australia">Australia</a>, you were more likely to live in Hawaii (the relative index) followed by California, Washington, Colorado, New York and Alaska:</p>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/graphic.statestat.australia.png" alt="Australia Google search query results" style="display:inline; width:300px; height:200px" /><br />
<cite>Australia Google search query results</cite></p>
<p>And if you did a search for <a href="http://statestats.appspot.com/?q=Angelique+Kidjo">Angelique Kidjo</a>, you were more likely to live in Massachusetts (relative index) followed by New York, the District of Columbia, Maryland and Washington:</p>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/graphic.statestat.angelique.kidjo.png" alt="Angelique Kidjo Google search query results" style="display:inline; width:300px; height:200px" /><br />
<cite>Angelique Kidjo Google search query results</cite></p>
<p>In an interesting twist, if you searched for any three of these terms you were more likely to have a higher than average income, have voted for Obama and be in a same sex relationship. Again I suspect these correlations are next to meaningless (how do they know this stuff?), but interesting to observe.</p>
<p>But of course what we all wanted to know is which states you were more likely to be living in if you did a search for <a href="http://statestats.appspot.com/?q=grilled+cheese+sandwich">grilled cheese sandwich</a>. I&#39;ll let the map speak for itself!</p>
