<p>I&#39;ve been reading <a href="http://jdlasica.com/">JD Lasica&#39;s</a> work ever since he started <a href="http://darknet.com/">Darknet</a> and <a href="http://ourmedia.org/">Ourmedia</a>… suffice to say, I&#39;m a fan! Today he posted a link to an article written around a year ago on the emerging journalistic fusion of blogs and wikis.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="http://www.socialmedia.biz/2008/10/wiki-journalism.html">Wiki journalism: are wikis the new blogs?</a></p>
<p>This has been around a while but is worth a read. <a href="http://onlinejournalismblog.com/2007/09/10/wiki-journalism-are-wikis-the-new-blogs/">Online Journalism Blog: Wiki journalism: are wikis the new blogs?</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I was <a href="http://www.socialmedia.biz/2008/10/wiki-journalism.html?cid=134982407#comments">the first to respond</a>, or the first to have a message approved… I&#39;m going to pretend I&#39;m certain that it&#39;s the first. I&#39;m interested to see where the discussion leads on from here.</p>
<blockquote><p>Found link to this article from your Twitter feed JD :-).</p>
<p>Interesting article from the point of view of sharing ideas and collaborating, but I don’t think wikis will replace blogs anytime soon.</p>
<p>I think while the architecture between the two might blur, people go to blogs and wikis for different reasons, and people collaborate on wikis and write blogs for different reasons.</p>
<p>I think it has to do with access: I like to think of wiki’s as &quot;random access&quot; where you visit a page from the outside with the full intent of reading what’s specifically on that page. Blogs on the other hand are &quot;sequential access&quot;, people read blogs generally to keep up to date with a person’s perspective, current events and opinions.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there won’t be a grey area between the two, and I think it’s an exciting prospect. The idea of a blog that can be edited by anyone, or a wiki who’s articles are changed and shown in chronological order would certainly be interesting, perhaps even deserving of a new term. Biki? Wlog? Bliki? Perhaps I should just stop now while I’m ahead!</p></blockquote>
