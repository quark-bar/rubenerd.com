<p>Fewer of my friends are blogging now than ever before, which is a shame. In the spirit of friends helping friends, I&#39;ve decided every now and then to share some blogs from people I read and enjoy, and that perhaps you should be reading too, in the hopes that perhaps it&#39;ll help reverse this trend :). Today we look at <a href="http://alonelyseptember.org/">A Lonely September</a>.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>Sebastian</h3>
<p>I first met Sebastian during a screening at the UTS Anime Club. He was substantially taller than me, with masses of light blond hair and a French accent so strong I couldn&#39;t understand a word he was saying. After reminding me I wasn&#39;t wearing my glasses, I put them on and realised he was in fact shorter than me, with dark coloured hair and sounded as French as me. Which is to say, not at all.</p>
<p>Even moreso than me, Seb (as he friends call him) is a worldly soul. Originally from Lima, he&#39;s an Australian citizen with ancestors originating from Peru, Spain, Holland and China <a href="http://alonelyseptember.org/about-2/">according to his about page</a>.</p>
<p>This is where I first ran into some serious issues. <em>Holland</em> of course refers to the specific area of <em>The Netherlands</em>, but many English speakers use the term to refer to the entire country. Is his ancestors specifically from the area we now know as <em>Holland</em>, or was he just referring to The Netherlands? </p>
<p>It only gets worse with <em>China</em>. While most people associate <em>China</em> with the <em>People&#39;s Republic of China</em>, the <em>Republic of China</em> that predominantly operates from Taiwan also considers itself the sole legitimate government of <em>China</em>, and even maintains the original Chinese characters instead of those simplified ones that are easier to write but look infinitely less cool. Which one is his ancestors from?</p>
<p>Should we be concerned that he intentionally obfuscated his origins? Is he involved in some dodgy business dealings that necessitate such shady writing?</p>

<h3>The Site</h3>
<p>But we&#39;re getting ahead of ourselves here, or ahead of his blog specifically. Perhaps in an attempt to render me foolish in the eyes of others, I was in the process of taking a screenshot of site, uploading it, and putting it here for the world to see, but no sooner had I done this but he quickly changed his blog theme. Whereas before he used the <a href="http://2010dev.wordpress.com/">Twenty Ten</a> theme by the WordPress team, he now appears to be using <a href="http://theme.fm/themes/san-fran/">San Fran</a>, a theme presumably named after San Francisco where those cable cars and fog are.</p>
<p>Ahah! FOG! He&#39;s clouding our judgement, you see. I&#39;m on to you Sebastian, you sneaky, sneaky devil you.</p>
<p>My second issue had to do with his server reliability. Upon entering his URL into Firefox and pressing the ENTER key which is located imminently to the left of the keyboard&#39;s edge under most circumstances, I was presented with this error message:</p>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/screenie.alonelyseptember.error.png" alt="" style="height:218px; width:500px;" /></p>
<p>Now I hear what you&#39;re saying. Ruben, it&#39;s entirely your fault, you didn&#39;t spell his domain name properly. While this is entirely true, I fault Sebastian entirely for this. If you&#39;re going to have a domain name, the least you could do is register every conceivable misspelling of it to redirect to the real address. With domains costing less than $20 a year to register and maintain, Seb could solve this problem for the low, low price of a few thousand dollars a year.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>As I&#39;ve written above, <a href="http://alonelyseptember.org/">A Lonely September</a> is a great read and consists of prose and wit that far eclipse mine: I have every confidence he can fulfill his dream to be a writer ^_^. Wait, did I write that above? Never mind, I intended to put it in there, and intentions are everything.</p>
<p>He&#39;s been running the site for over a year now, and I look forward to the next one :).</p>
