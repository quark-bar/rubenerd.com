Clara and I are building a retro Hi-Fi system. We love physical media, and it's fun way to reconnect with music after losing something with streaming services. My dad always had a fully-stocked Hi-Fi, and he's offered a bunch of it to start our setup. We're also still going to Japan&mdash;maybe?&mdash;later this month and will be checking out second-hand stores, assuming we can get dual-voltage units.

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/kenwood_lvd-290.jpg" alt="The Kenwood LVD-290 Laserdisc player" style="width:354px; height:103px;" /></p>

But in doing my usual obsessive research the question has come up: what is the standard size for a Hi-Fi rack? Every article I've been able to find online references two dimensions:

* 19-inch, or 483 mm, the size of a standard rack unit
* 17-inch, or 432 mm
* Mini, or 250 mm
* Micro, smaller than those

But as with so many things, these are more of a guideline than an actual rule. Almost every device I've researched fits one of these sizes instead:

* 440 cm wide
* 360 cm wide

My Kenwood Laserdisc player and Yamaha receiver are 440 cm, but many of the graphic equalisers and cassette decks I've been looking at are 360 cm; to say nothing about the wildly different depths.

I may or may not obsess over having matching things, so I'm figuring out whether I try and keep things the same 440 cm dimension, or I just have two stacks for the different sizes. If they're stacked next to each other, I figure the difference in their sizes could be useful for airflow. 

As long as they're the same 1980s-90s angular black design as the aforementioned components above, I'll be okay.
