A discussion with Allan Jude on Twitter lead me to read up on [NNTP on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol) again for nostalgic feels, where I made a shocking discovery:

> The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) is an application protocol used for transporting Usenet news articles (netnews) between news servers and for reading and posting articles by end user client applications. Brian Kantor of the University of California, San Diego and Phil Lapsley of the University of California, Berkeley wrote RFC 977, the specification for the Network News Transfer Protocol, in March 1986. Other contributors included Stan O. Barber from the Baylor College of Medicine and Erik Fair of Apple Computer.

NNTP is... my age? Does that make NNTP young, or me old? Let's not think about it too much.

**Update:** I read the [original RFC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc977), and it says its *February 1986*, not March. So NNTP is older than me after all.
