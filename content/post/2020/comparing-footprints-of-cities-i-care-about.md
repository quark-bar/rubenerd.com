I've long been interested to get a scale for the various cities I've either grown up in or love visiting, but it never occurred to me to just do a simple [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/) comparison:

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/cities@2x.png" alt="Maps showing cities listed above." style="width:500px; height:750px;" /></p>

From top left to bottom right we have:

* **Sydney**, which just fits
* Five boroughs of **New York City**, with a bit of New Jersey
* Tiny, tiny **Singapore** with Johor Bahru across the Causeway
* **Hong Kong**, which is closer in size to Singapore than I realised!
* Klang Valley, with **Kuala Lumpur** and **Putrajaya**
* Kansai Region, with **Ōsaka** and **Kyōto**

I checked Tōkyō, and it would have covered almost all six squares. I'll bet some cities in China would be similar.
