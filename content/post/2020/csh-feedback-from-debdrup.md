[Via Twitter](https://twitter.com/debdrup/status/1266863879759572999), regarding my earlier post about [ksh and csh](https://rubenerd.com/netbsd-used-to-default-to-csh/) in the BSDs:

> @Rubenerd About your latest article on #NetBSD csh; tcsh (and csh) in #FreeBSD is quite a bit different: It's really both tcsh (ie. same exact binary), it's got a lot of fixes, coming from the canonical upstream [github.com/tcsh-org/tcsh](https://github.com/tcsh-org/tcsh) as indicated by psrc/contrib/tcsh/README.md
