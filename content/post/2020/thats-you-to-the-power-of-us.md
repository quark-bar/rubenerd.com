An Australian university has been putting these ads on video streaming services:

> It's a human equation.   
> That puts you at the heart of everything we do.   
> It means knocking down the walls that limit us.   
> That's *You*, to the power of *Us*.

Unfortunately that paradigm-shifting, synergistic dynamic doesn't extend beyond their marketing department's expansive cliché unit. Such is their penchant for manufacturing fluff, they've succumbed to knocking down their own walls to generate sufficient storage capacity. Why they couldn't merely condense or compress the fluff is perhaps a question best suited to their physics department.

I long for honest messages with substance, even in advertising. Probably I'm still too naïve, Professor Bayes.
