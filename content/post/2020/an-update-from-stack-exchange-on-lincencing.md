Last September a [lot of us were concerned](https://rubenerd.com/stack-exchange-changing-licences/) with the decision by Stack Exchange to unilaterially change the licences on previously-submitted user content, which is against Creative Commons' guidelines and the terms of the licences themselves.

Tim Post has [finally responded](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/344491/an-update-on-creative-commons-licensing?cb=1)\:

> We are still investigating the question of substantial edits to content licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 now that we’ve switched to version 4.0. For the time being, pending final clarification on this, content will be listed with a license based on its creation date. This would mean if a question or answer was created under CC BY-SA 3.0, revisions to it made today would also be released under CC BY-SA 3.0, not 4.0.

And that:

> Your feedback made it clear that your concerns were mostly about the way the change was handled, and not so much about any specific version of the CC BY-SA license. 

This seems like the most pragmatic way to go, though I wonder why it took six months of silence before we got a formal response.

I don't submit to those sites anymore; I advocate people posting on platforms they control. But SE is a huge resource, and the clarification is welcome.
