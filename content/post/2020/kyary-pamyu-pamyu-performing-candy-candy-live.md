I feel like we all need some more optimistic joy for this week's [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday), my ongoing blog post series where I share music on Mondays.

My friends and I saw Kyary perform live in Sydney a few years ago now. I think it was the second concert Clara and I ever went to together. Her energy, backing dancers, sets, everything was incredible!
