It's [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday/) time once more, that time of the week when I share a song, jingle, or tune such that we all may all bask in its veritable brillance. I don't make the rules. Actually, I didn't, this series originally started on my [university anime club blog](https://rubenerd.com/anime-music-monday/) back in the day.

Today we have this delightfully dreadful jingle from 1989. Why *Keep Up With the Commodore*, when you can *PS/2 it!?* Don't answer that.
