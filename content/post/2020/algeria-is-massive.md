I loved reading CD-ROM and dead tree atlases&mdash;atlasii?&mdash;as a kid, and I still adore maps. But there are swaths of the world I'm not as familiar with as I should be, so I've been trying to fill in the gaps. Today I was comparing Algeria to other places in North Africa, and the penny only just dropped how *big* it is.

According to the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ag.html), Algeria is the 11th largest country in the world with a land area of more than 2.3 million square kilometres. For comparison:

* Western Australia is the only state in the country that's larger, at 2.6m km². Algeria's borders almost stretch from Melbourne to Townsville! 

* It's bigger than any North American state and province, including Texas, Alaska, and Quebec. Nunavut is the only one that comes close, at 2.0m km².

* It's larger than Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the Iberian peninsula, Italy, Lichtenstein and Poland *combined*. Okay I threw in Lichtenstein for fun :).

* Kazakhstan, the other former Soviet republic I associate with being massive, is only 0.4m km² larger!

My hunch is that evil Mercator projection is responsible for making me think northern Africa was smaller than it actually is. Here's Algeria over the top of Australia, South-East Asia, the Sea of Japan, and the US, using the awesome [True Size](https://thetruesize.com) site. Australia and the US are at a different scale to fit.
