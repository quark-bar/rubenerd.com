I haven't been able to stop looking of this view of Gangtok from Ganesh Tok point in northern India. [Subhrajyoti07 wrote on Wikimedia Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bird%27s_eye_view_of_Gangtok_City_from_Ganeshtok.jpg)\:

Gangtok is the capital of Sikkim, which became an Indian state in 1975. If the name or landscape looks familiar, it's the part of India nestled between Nepal and Bhutan. You can check it out on [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1791324#map=10/27.6026/88.4660).
