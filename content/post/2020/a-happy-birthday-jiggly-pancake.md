This was one of the more surreal birthdays I've had. Getting a cake delivered because you've been advised not to go outside is a new one. In past years we just did [Earth Hour](https://rubenerd.com/p3940/) and turned the lights off. Still, as my sister messaged me, there's no pressure to do anything when the situation is like this, amirite?

We figured the situation could only get worse, so earlier in the month Clara and I went to the Japanese Gram pancake place that just opened in Chatswood for an early birthday breakfast. We tried going to one of their branches in Osaka a couple of years ago but they were all out of their signature jiggly pancakes.

They were so, *so* good!
