A famous pizza chain in Australia had their customer account database stolen a few years ago. I was living in Mascot with Clara at the time, a suburb just south of Sydney. I was lucky that I never use my real name on these services, and I use one-off passwords with [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) which you should also use because its great.

Years later I still get regular emails like this:

> Subject: Jeff, Mascot?
>        
> Jeff   
> are you in Mascot?

These kinds of social engineering attacks are far more dangerous than general spam. Your location is a piece of information an attacker would need to know in advance, which unsuspecting or trusting email users could interpret as adding legitimacy. Like my hat.

A related, widely-discussed scam involves sending a leaked password you once used to scare you into sending them money:

> Some time ago your computer was infected with my private software, RAT (Remote Administration Tool). I know your password is ce#Dz!7oy]m(Fc$. My malware gave me access to all your accounts, contacts and it was possible to spy on you over your webcam.

This is unrelated, but I thought it was funny that my long passphrase of gibberish was truncated with the first dollar sign. Some suspect scammer's software must have <del>alliterated</del> parsed it as [regex](http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave.Marshall/Internet/NEWS/regexp.html#begin "Dave Marshall: Matching the beginning or end of a line").

Next time you have another video call or catchup with family, it might be a great opportunity to bring up what they know about email and web scams. Education is  our best defence against these kinds of attacks. Attackers making mistakes may be #2.
