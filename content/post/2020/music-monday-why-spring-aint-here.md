It's [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday/) time, that day of the week when I etc and so forth. Today I share a song from my favourite singer-songwriter Michael Franks, and a lyric I've misheard for years:

> Increasingly, I start to see why   
> Spring ain't here   
> I can't demote my overcoat 'cause   
> Spring ain't here   
> I still am seen in MLB 'cause   
> Spring ain't here   
> Turn up the song and don't be long   
> Make spring... be... here   

*(I wrote this in Markdown and all the lines ran together because I forgot to put the invisible spaces at the end. I'm starting to think all the weird edge cases and unfriendly things like that make it not worth using. But I digress).*

This is from the song "Why Spring Ain't Here" from his 1999 album *[Barefoot on the Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot_on_the_Beach)*. Since I was a kid I've always thought that line about MLB was weird: what does it stand for, and why would him being in it have to do with it not yet being spring?

I checked the liner notes from the CD and the line is *L.L.Bean*. A web search retured it as an American retailer. I'd tell you more about them, but they had newsletter popup spam so I had to [close the tab](https://tabcloseddidntread.com/).

As a side node, you can tell most lyric sites pilfer off each other given the same typo appeared everywhere:

>  I still am **seem** in L.L.Bean cause

Time to chill from more music from that album, me thinks.
