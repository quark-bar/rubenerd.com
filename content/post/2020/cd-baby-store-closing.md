I only just saw that the self-described *the best independent music store on the web* [posted this](https://diymusician.cdbaby.com/business/the-music-business-is-evolving-and-were-evolving-with-it/):

> 2020 is already off to an exciting start! CD Baby recently announced we’re delivering your music to TikTok. This week we partnered with Boomplay, the fastest growing music app in Africa, helping you reach a whole new market for your music. And we have big things in development for this year and beyond, including pay splits, new promo tools, and a whole lot more.

Uh oh.

> Our mission is to help artists monetize and promote their music in the best ways possible. In order to provide the tools and services you need to succeed in an evolving music ecosystem...

That press speak can only mean one thing.

> ... we’ve made the decision to retire the CD Baby retail store on March 31st, 2020.

The end of an era. I bought most of my Whole Wheat Radio music from them; I liked to think of them as the last part of the original mission still around. They will still continue to sell through the big names you've heard of&mdash;with their big cuts&mdash;but it's a huge blow to independent music distribution. But hey, they have TikTok now.
