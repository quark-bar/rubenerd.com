I ran into a fun mental exercise and promptly apologised. What if you had a $100 million but could only procure goods and services that share your name's starting letter? It's difficult to think of a contract, will, or prize upon which such a condition would be stipulated, but then again that sum of money is equally unlikely.

*(As an aside, remember when these hypothetical started with a million dollars? That would barely cover the cost of most houses in Australia).*

Let's call out the loopholes first, which I will not employ:

* Using a generic descriptor, such as a **red** house or a **ravishing** hat. I'd just include my wishlist here prepended with **really awesome**.

* Increasing liquidity by converting the money into **ringgit**. Aside from rendering the entire exercise pointless, Malaysia places strict controls on its forex anyway. Maybe rupiah, rials, or rubles.

So here's my list, in descending order of importance:

1. **Research** of a medical nature. Either opening a not-for-profit lab, or continuing to provide guaranteed funding for existing researchers.

2. **Rural Railways** that are shutting down. I'd convert them into tourist trains, or keep them viable for communities that need them.

3. **Radio**, shortwave or national FM/AM, to compete with the rubbish that's current talkback radio. With a web stream too. Would basically be a front to funnel money into journalism with an evidence-based, scientific perspective (aka: facts) to counter Murdoch, and some good independent music. And I know just who I'd [want to run it](https://jimkloss.com).

3. **Residences** for Clara and myself. A small apartment in Sydney and Singapore would be lovely. Naturally the places I like the most have some of the most overpriced real estate in the world.

4. **Retirement**, so I could spend my time contributing to open source software, independent media, and travelling. If I make the mistake of finding work I enjoy again, this would just be a nice nest egg.

5. **Retreats**, like a little hidey hole in Kyoto I can introvert in for a couple of weeks of the year.

6. **Retro Computers**. Okay that's a bit of a cheat, but "retro computer" is a specific and discrete thing. Yes.
