Speaking of retrospectives, I saw a few Twitterlings share their favourite anime for each year of the 2010s. I think this is a great idea, so I've compiled my own list. Just as they did, the years correspond with when I saw them, not necessarily when they originally came out.

* **2010:** *K-On!* This was the moeblob to end all moeblobs. It was unapologetically fun, cheerful, and true to the original four panel comics. I wanted to give each one of the light music club cast a hug.

* **2011:** *Gurren Lagann*. It came out back in 2007, but I only finished it in 2011. And wow, what a series. Probably one of my all time favourite science fiction shows, let alone anime. This narrowly beat out *Tatami Galaxy*.

* **2012:** *Hyouka*. It's Clara's and my series. ♡

* **2013:** *Penguindrum*. I normally give shows that involve hospitals as a plot device a hard pass for obvious reasons, but everything about this series was perfect. Though I had *Rock Over Japan* in my head for months. This narrowly beat *Gatchaman Crowds*.

* **2014:** *Barakamon*. My favourite anime series of all time. It was a touching story of someone my age going through the same self doubt I was, only he went to an island and did something about it. This narrowly beat out *Madoka Magica*.

* **2015:** *Shirokuma Cafe*. What a beautiful, fun series. I'm sensing a trend. I watched the anime first, then made my way through the manga. It was the first anime I played for my dad and his partner, and that I watched with my sister who now watches more stuff than I do!

* **2016:** *Fate/Stay Night: Unlimited Blade Works*. My favourite arc and lead from the original *Fate/Stay Night* was given such spectacular treatment with this retelling. Tohsaka Rin in HD gave me palpitations.

* **2017:** *SKET Dance*. It came out a while ago, but I watched the entire series over a period of weeks with Clara. I adore the characters, dare I say it even more than *Gintama's*.

* **2018:** *Isekai Izakaya "Nobu"*. Another lighthearted and fun show about a restaurant with an entrance to another world that Clara and I looked forward to each week. The iRL Japanese travel guides at the end of each episode were also charming and delightful. This narrowly beat *Holmes of Kyoto*.

* **2019:** *Yuru Camp*. It's fitting that we end the decade with a series as fun and loveable as where we started. I technically first saw it in 2018, but I'd since watched it twice more in 2019 it was so good. This narrowly beat *Astra*, which truthfully I've only read but still haven't watched yet.

I really need to restore my 2000s anime blog now that I've recovered many of the backups. I might do a retro-retrospective of that decade too at some point, might be fun.
