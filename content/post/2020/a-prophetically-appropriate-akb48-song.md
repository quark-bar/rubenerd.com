Is this the first time I've ever shared an AKB48 song here, in fifteen years? Am I publishing a [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday/) on a Tuesday again? The answers to both questions may surprise you!

The DJ's introduction to this unashamedly bubbly song from 2013 seems oddly prophetic and well-suited to our current times. I hope we're all dancing around in our places of work and in the street again soon, and that I'm even 10% as cool as that cab driver when I'm his age :)
