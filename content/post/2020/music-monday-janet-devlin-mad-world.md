It's [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday/), that time of the week in which it's Monday, and I blog about Music. Why was Music capitalised in that previous sentence twice, and again here? And why, having discovered my mistake, did I elucidate further rather than simply correcting the examples for which attention has now been Needlessly drawn? Wait, damn it.

I do like me some [Tears for Fears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1ZvPSpLxCg), and [Gary Jules'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3N1MlvVc4) cover of their *Mad World* song is one of my all time favourite songs. I'd never heard of [Janet Devlin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H42q3j55wKQ) until tonight, but *wow*.
