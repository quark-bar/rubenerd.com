I still use Subversion for reasons when I can, so I had to remind myself how to create a new self-hosted Git somewhere.

On your remote FreeBSD server, for example:

    # pkg install git-lite
    $ mkdir ~/shinyrepo
    $ cd ~/shinyrepo
    $ git init --bare

On your workstation:

    $ git clone username@host:shinyrepo

This is assuming the repo is in your home directory, which in production you probably would [stash](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash)&mdash;ah, so good&mdash;somewhere else.
