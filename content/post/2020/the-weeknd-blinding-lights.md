I love that 80s synths are [used like this today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMQSbqZZEfA), rather than just for a hook. It's rather pretty; and what a great way to perform it live!

That concludes this [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music/monday). Tune in next Monday when I'll have more music, as the name suggests.
