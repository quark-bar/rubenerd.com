Statistically, numerically, and probabilistically&mdash;is that even a word?&mdash;having a birthday at the same time as another person or event is nothing special. At best you have a one in 365 chance, at worse 1 in 366. But it's still fun when it happens.

For example, [@Sohuzi on Twitter uploaded this](https://twitter.com/Sohuzi/status/1243519359911419907) on the 27th:

I also learned from editing Wikipedia that [several stations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaize_Station_(Nagasaki)) on the Nishi-Kyūshū Line in Nagasaki were opened on the 27th of March 1920:

> Kaize Station (皆瀬駅, Kaize-eki, かいぜえき) is a train station located in Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan. It is on the Nishi-Kyūshū Line which has been operated by the third-sector Matsuura Railway since 1988.

1988 is only a couple years off being the right year too. Here's a photo of the station [taken by Atsasebo](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mr_kaize_station.jpg) and put on Wikimedia Commons.
