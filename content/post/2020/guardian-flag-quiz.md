[The Guardian have a quiz](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/01/flags-quiz-how-well-do-you-know-the-flags-of-the-world) to test your international flag knowledge if you're after something fun to try this weekend. I got full marks, even despite being thrown by all the incorrect aspect ratios in their lead image *grrrr!*

I've always loved reading about flags and their history. I'd always bring one back from countries we'd travelled to; at one point I had them pinned to my bedroom ceiling which was delightfully colourful.

It's tough picking my absolute favourite, but I have a few candidates below. See if you can guess them before clicking through any of them! It's interesting that all my favourites thus far are sub-national entities.
