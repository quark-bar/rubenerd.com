I went for a long walk outside for the first time in weeks. The NSW government has classified exercise as an acceptable excuse to leave the home, provided you maintain social distancing. It was *so good* to stretch my legs.

It felt weird wandering around the empty streets and witnessing the regular running of ghostly, empty commuter trains. I love that I shot that silly photo by mistake: it summed up my weird mood pretty well.
