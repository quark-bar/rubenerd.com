Security researcher and gentleman Mikko Hyppönen [tweeted this in 2016](https://twitter.com/mikko/status/808291670072717312)\:

> Hypponen's law: Whenever an appliance is described as being "smart", it's vulnerable.

My favourite response was [from @naranek](https://twitter.com/naranek/status/808310667673530368)\:

> It's probably time to start calling "dumb" appliances "safe" instead. Would you want a smart fridge or a safe fridge?

It also reminds me of Geroge Neville-Neil's comment at AsiaBSDCon 2018:

> The *S* in *IoT* stands for security
