I've started including silly, pointless easter eggs in webinars and conference calls. Without having the visual and social cues from live events, I've found them a fun way to engage and get immediate feedback. I've done it a few times now and thus far I haven't been called out for it... cough.

Today we were talking about network security, so I named one of the demo networks [IPX/SFX](https://www.novell.com/documentation/nw6p/pdfdoc/ipx_enu/ipx_enu.pdf). I searched Wikimedia Commons for a graphic to go with it and [found this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Novell_NetWare_2.0_packages.jpg) by someone with the username Diaper via Flickr:

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/netware-packages@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/netware-packages@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/netware-packages@2x.jpg 2x" alt="Picture of NetWare boxes in the rubbish." style="width:400px; height:300px;" /></p>

Someone had strong opinions!
