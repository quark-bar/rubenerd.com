It's with a heavy heart that I saw this on the [CD Baby store](https://store.cdbaby.com/):

> CD Baby retired our music store in March of 2020 in order to place our focus entirely on the tools and services that are most meaningful to musicians today and tomorrow. 

I love marketing speak; what does the second half of the above sentence even mean? Surely artists being able to sell music would rank highly among *meaningful* tools for them. As photographers would say, you can't eat exposure.

Most of the music I bought through Whole Wheat Radio came through CD Baby back in the day, though I was using them as of last year too. I'm switching to Bandcamp now for people who publish there, but it still feels like a shame.
