There are [some interesting stats and graphs](https://www.accc.gov.au/regulated-infrastructure/communications/national-broadband-network-nbn/nbn-wholesale-market-indicators-report/march-quarter-2020-report) in this broadband report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission:

* There are now 7.1 million National Broadband Network (NBN) connections, a 6.9% increase from last quarter. But only 4.6 million of these are above 50 Mb/s, which isn't surprising given the legacy technologies being used, and pretty embarrassing by world standards.

* It's no contest for providers: Telstra has almost 50% market share, and 84% with TPG and Optus. It's a stark reminder not to get comfortable in an echo chamber: Aussie Broadband and Superloop must only make a fraction of the remainder.

* Considering the population difference, New South Wales has fewer connections per capita than Victoria and Queensland. I suspect that's rural areas being left out as they always are, though my boss says even his family just outside Sydney has only just been connected.

* The final graph shows that Australian NBN services overtook DSL around March 2018. A far cry from Malcolm Turnbull's promised *faster cheaper sooner* rollout, but earlier than I expected.
