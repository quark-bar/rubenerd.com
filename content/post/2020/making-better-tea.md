The BBC ran a video last year about how [we all drink tea wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fhuc6qOGNPc). Normally I give clickbaity titles like this a hard pass, but I watched it in a moment of weakness and found it surprisingly interesting. Unlike so many of these *you're living life wrong* videos, it had science to back its claims.

These were their steps to improving your tea:

* Use a ceramic or glass mug, not plastic. Styrofoam especially absorbs flavour. Drink it out of a red mug if you find tea too bitter, because psychologically we perceive red as being ripe and sweet.

* Filter your water. Hard water leads to scum, especially with milk, which removes flavour.

* Steep for five minutes. That extra time allows more antioxidants, flavour molecules, and caffeine to be released from a given bag.

I also appreciated that they started with a reference to loose leaf, but went to discussing teabags given most people in the real world use them. Now all they need to do is avoid the milk!
