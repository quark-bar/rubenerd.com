I got a couple of fun emails this morning. Here's one perporting to be from a Garth Evans in 12px Verdana:

> Hello, This is a brief but sharp-toned letter about how the reader can use your material. If you want to.

And that's it. It's a shame, I was looking forward to being sharply-toned.

Here's a style of message from Amy that I get on a weekly basis, staying on the theme of using material. I replaced the tech with `$BLAH`, given the surrounding language changes so little with each of these:

> Hi Ruben, I noticed you've shared `$BLAH`, as you might be aware, `$BLAH` announced at `$TIME` that it would be shutting down. We’ve put together a guide to the best alternatives. Here’s the link. Perhaps you could update your page to include a link to our guide so that anyone still interested in `$BLAH` has an alternative.

As an aside, is a phrase with three words. It also says a lot when we're used to things just shutting down. I used to self-host because I love tinerking with FreeBSD and NetBSD servers; now I do it as an act of self-preservation.

Here's one from Adrian that's definitely formatted properly so as to be taken seriously:

> We noticed that you run a nice blog at rubenerd.com .Apps4Rent would like to sponsor a post on your blog. We are willing to pay a onetime fee to insert a Marketing message in one of your existing posts. An example message is: “Two useful technologies for working from anywhere – Cloud Desktop and Cloud SharePoint.”, with two dofollow links going to our websites.

Here's one where they spelled my name correctly:

> Dear Email User, Your email address has been selected as one of our lucky winners, see **attcachment** for details.

*Gesundheit!* And finally, someone claiming to be called Olga who's after men over forty&mdash;sorry Olga&mdash;had this delightful footer:
 
> This message has been scanned for viruses and dangerous content by MailScanner, and is believed to be clean.

Well, that's a relief.
