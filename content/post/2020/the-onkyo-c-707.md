I think I may have found the world's cutest CD changer: the *Onkyo C-707*. I'd snap one up for our little home hi-fi if it came in black. I adore the light gold case, but I want all our stuff to match.

[suwa-koubou.jp](http://www.suwa-koubou.jp/repair/c_707ch/c_707ch.html) has some photos of the unit with its larger tray door and LCD.

This is not to be confused with the [B-707](https://www.airliners.net/search?keywords=boeing+707 "Airliners.net image of the Boeing 707"), which is an aircraft and significantly larger.
