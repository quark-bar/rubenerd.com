I thought I'd cop flack for my ARM Mac post, but I've had more comments about my [reservations on Markdown brackets](https://rubenerd.com/markdown-links-have-the-brackets-backwards/). These were in my inbox on the weekend, starting with Gabriel S:

> I thought that was just me!

And Hales:

> Yes. Definitely yes. Round brackets for the roundy human bit, square brackets for the squarey computer bit.

Hales also mentioned how MediaWiki does [external links](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Links#External_links) with a single square bracket around the human link and the URL, which I agree is much easier. He also mentioned Textile, which I remember back when my blog was briefly on TextPattern.

And finally, HLA quoted a portion of the post with a üëç. Thanks!

I haven't committed to it yet, but I'm thinking as part of learning emacs&mdash;or even if I decide to stick with Vim for everything&mdash;I might try and set up some macros to do inline HTML for me as I did in the old days.
