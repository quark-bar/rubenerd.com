I was an *IDOLM@STER* guy growing up, and I still fully respect its superiority over *Love Live*. **Accept no substitutes!** I also acknowledge I've long been in the minority, so I'm always happy to see when the enduring franchise gets some attention.

But this [AmiAmi rendition of Morino Rinze](https://www.amiami.com/eng/detail?gcode=FIGURE-058189) from *SHINY COLOURS* may be one of the best figs I've ever seen, full stop. Material science has come so far that such a detailed fig is now not only possible, but economically feasible at scale. And check out all that *colour!*

I'd hoped that Handa-san would have got a similar fig with him brandishing his giant calligraphy brush in that now-legendary scene from *Barakamon*. Clara and I hold out hope.
