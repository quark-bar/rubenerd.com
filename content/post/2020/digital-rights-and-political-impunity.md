Greg Jericho wrote a [brilliant essay](https://meanjin.com.au/essays/the-trouble-with-journalism/) for this quarter's Meanjin journal. He discusses the destructive need for journalists to appear neutral, impacts of the 24-hour news cycle and social media, extremism, and how journalists have failed to deliver meaningful climate change action.

But it's this point about the dreadful Australian [metadata retention](https://rubenerd.com/tag/metadata-retention/) scheme I hadn't considered, emphasis added:

> The same thing occurred more recently with [former Australian Attorney General] George Brandis and his ‘car crash’ interview with David Speers on metadata. Brandis did eventually get to a correct explanation of the concept, but it was a terribly bumbling answer. And yes, I know, you have to hold them to account. Fine. So Brandis had a car-crash interview, Speers won a Walkley. **The metadata legislation passed without any problem whatsoever**.

I see people opine on Twitter that journalists don't deliver hard hitting questions and *gotchas* when they get the chance. But when you have people in charge who don't care and continue to act without impunity, it doesn't seem to matter.
