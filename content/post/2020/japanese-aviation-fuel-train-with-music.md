This video by [うえP (UEP)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1OwxvX3sy05cUB-w4gRx_A) shows an US Army aviation fuel transport train that runs in from the Tsurumi Oil Storage Facility (Azumi Station on the Tsurumi Line) to the US Army Yokota Air Base (Haijima Station on the Ome Line).

Normally I don't get video recommendations because I only access YouTube via a proxy, but it was immediately under the [live video feed](https://rubenerd.com/feed/live-video-feeds-of-tokyo-trains/) I may or may not be watching continuously.

I'm *tenuously* counting this as a [Music Monday](), because the opening background tune is lovely.
