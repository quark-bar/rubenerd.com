I watched so many VHS tapes of this iconic steam locomotive growing up. Perhaps the most memorable was when it ran with the *Flying Scotsman* 4472 around Australia for the Bicentennial.

She'd been having boiler problems for many years, so it was such a delight to see her steaming again under her own power. Clara and I will need to head back there to check her out once she's been repainted.
