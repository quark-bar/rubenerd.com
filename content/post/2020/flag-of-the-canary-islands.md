I've always thought of myself an ameateur vexillologist; not least because the name sounds cool. So I was thrilled when I saw this tricolour on someone's bio earlier today that I didn't recognise!

A reverse image search determined this is the [state flag of the Canary Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Canary_Islands), in use since 1960 and officially in 1982. The institutional flag below includes the territory's coat of arms. Or two dog coats here.

And speaking of canaries, it got me thinking what flags have birds on them. Off the top of my head I think of [Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Albania), [American Samoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_American_Samoa), the [ACT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_Australian_Capital_Territory), [Christmas Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island), [Equador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Ecuador), [Papua New Guinea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Papua_New_Guinea), [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_San_Francisco), [South Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_South_Australia), [Western Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Western_Australia), and the [state flag of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Germany). But there's [way more than I expected](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Flags_with_birds).
