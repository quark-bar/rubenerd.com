It's some welcome good news in the fog, and announced by a President on Twitter no less! Translated from Carlos Alvarado Quesada's [original Spanish](https://twitter.com/CarlosAlvQ/status/1265160738936631296?s=20)\:

> Costa Rica officially recognises equal marriage. Today we celebrate freedom, equality and our democratic institutions. May empathy and love be the compass that allow us to get ahead and build a country where all people fit.

Imagine having a leader who spoke like that.
