Every PNG image on this blog goes through [ImageMagick] to create [srcset] versions, then [pngcrush] to losslessly optimise them. The savings are routinely upwards of 40% for the same visuals, or 40pc if I go by some bizarre modern style guides.

I was reviewing my dotfile aliases, like a gentleman, and noticed pngcrush had an option I hadn't noticed before:

    -loco ("loco crush" truecolor PNGs)

From the [help file]\:

> Make the file more compressible by performing a lossless, reversible, color transformation. The resulting file is a MNG, not a PNG, and should  be given the ".mng" file extension. The "loco" option has no effect on grayscale or indexed-color PNG files.

I thought it may have been a neural network trained on locomotives. *Trained* on *locomotives?* That was some top-shelf humour.
