I'm not a developer anymore, but I still like to watch videos and read papers on the subject. Today I stumbled across this talk by Richard Feldman exploring why functional programming isn't the norm. But he also goes into graphing general language use over time, and the soft and technical motivations for why developers choose specific languages and frameworks.

*(Most of the comments concerned the fact that non-functional languages are inherently sticker and more useful because they're multi-paradigm, whereas functional languages require an all-or-nothing approach. I don't know enough about it to comment).*
