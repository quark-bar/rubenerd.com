Last Saturday I talked about how financial comparison and consumer advoacy sites were [failing to address security](https://rubenerd.com/even-respected-sites-are-failing-to-address-fintech/), with one going as far as to only summarise a new service as having *encryption technology*. If that's all it takes, my blog here could host your financial information. I suppose I should be flattered if you want to take me up on that, but you most definitely shouldn't.

Here's [BPAY's site](https://bpay.com.au/bpay-for-you) as a counter-example:

> **Is BPAY safe?**
> 
> All BPAY payments are made within the secure environment of your online banking. BPAY doesn’t receive any of your personal details or account details during the payment process.
> 
> To find out more about the security features of your online banking, and how you can help protect your personal information contact your bank. 

It's still light on details, but it's leagues ahead.
