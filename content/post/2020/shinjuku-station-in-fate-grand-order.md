*Speaking of [Japanese trains](https://rubenerd.com/live-video-feeds-of-tokyo-trains/)!* I was farming [Fate/Grand Order](https://fate-go.us) quartz yesterday, like a gentleman, and came across this Shinjuku train station setting:

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/screenie.fgo.shinjuku@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/screenie.fgo.shinjuku@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2020/screenie.fgo.shinjuku@2x.jpg 2x" alt="Screenshot from the game, showing a train indicator sign." style="width:500px" /></p>

The circled red M would be the [Tōkyō Metro Marunouchi Line](https://www.tokyometro.jp/lang_en/station/line_marunouchi/index.html). Maybe the green square could be the [JR Yamanote Loop Line](https://www.jreast.co.jp/estation/result.aspx?mode=2&rosen=66=1=%E5%B1%B1%E6%89%8B%E7%B7%9A), and the blue bar could be the [Chūō Main Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C5%AB%C5%8D_Main_Line). The others I'm not sure about; there isn't a purple JR line serving that station, or a circled T line on the Tōkyō Metro or Toei Subway.
