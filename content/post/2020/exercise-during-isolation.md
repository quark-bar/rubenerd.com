I've definitely felt a shift in my mood since I've been forcing myself to get more exercise again. I hadn't realised how much walking and other activity a day takes, especially when compared to working from home metres away from your kitchen and bed.

Late in the evening feels like one of the better times. It's easy to socially distance when you're the only one around.
