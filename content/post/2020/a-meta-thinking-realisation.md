I was sitting here thinking, and had a meta realisation at how wonderful that is. I'm in a coffee shop in the late afternoon, on my laptop which I can afford to have and run. The weather is beautiful. I'm healthy and am in full possession of my faculties.

The *royal they* say luck is opportunity meeting preparation. I always thought that was a bit of a cop-out; its at least half spontaneity entirely outside your control as well. So therefore,, I'm just lucky in general too.

I've been feeling a tad glum of late. I think it'll be useful to remember this feeling I'm having now when that comes up.
