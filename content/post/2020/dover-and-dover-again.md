Music has the uncanny ability to transport us back to places and time like precious few other things. For me this ability opearates independently of whether I liked the song at the time; often I didn't like it *precicely* because it was a shameless ear worm without substance.

Early this week I heard someone blasting [Over and Over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_and_Over_(Nelly_song)) by Nelly and TimMcGraw from back in 2004. It took me immediately back to high school, when I'd irritate people singing the awful chorus:

> Because it's all in my head
> I think about it *Dover* an' *Dover* again
> I replay *Dover* an' *Dover* again

Those weren't the lyrics, but it sounded like it was. [Dover MRT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover_MRT_station) also opened a few years prior.

I'm not filing this under [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday/), because that's for stuff I like.
