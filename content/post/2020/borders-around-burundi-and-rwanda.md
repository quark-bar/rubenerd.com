As I've written about here before, I loved reading atlasus&mdash;atlasii?&mdash;as a kid, but my topographic knowledge of central Africa is inexcusibly poor. I decided 2020 would be the year I'd learn more about African geography, particularly the Equatorial region.

I didn't realise Burundi was so small at 27,834 km², which is much closer to Rwanda's 26,338 km² than I realised. The image below is from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=burundi#map=9/-3.3901/29.9253)\:
