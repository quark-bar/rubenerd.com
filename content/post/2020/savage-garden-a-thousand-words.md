It's another installment of [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday/), the series in which I share audible emissions set to recognisable tunes. It's not Monday though, whoops.

Today we venture back to the late 1990s, when Savage Garden owned the radio airwaves in Australia and Southeast Asia. *A Thousand Words* from their eponymous&mdash;geshunteit&mdash;album wasn't one of my favourites, but this stanza made me curious:

> You can resurrect a thousand words;    
> To deceive me more and more.    
> A thousand words will give the reason    
> Why I don't need you anymore;    
> I'll say the words out loud.    
> I'll say a thousand words or more.

I ran the lyrics through [wc(1)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=wc) and got:

    $ wc -w lyrics.txt
    ==>     243 lyrics.txt

So they'd have to sing that song at least five times to get to a thousand words or more. That's fewer times than I always assumed and expected.
