Equinix in Australia just advised us:

> The following additional processes have been implemented across our [data centres] in Asia-Pacific:
> 
> * Before entering the data center, all visitors are required to have their temperature checked by the facility staff using no-contact infrared thermometers. We do not record any of the information collected. Those who have a body temperature above 37.3 degree Celsius will not be allowed to enter the data center
> 
> * Hand sanitizers have been placed at the security counter of all data centers
> 
> * Liquid soap, disposable towels and hand dryers are available in data center restrooms

Getting a temperature check before going into the data centre reminds me of Singapore immigration during SARS. The Coronavirus has now killed more people.
