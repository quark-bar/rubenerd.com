I have a text file to track sites that broke with NoScript and cookie blocking, and what additional whitelisted domains are reqired.

> **Fastmail**   
> fastmail.fm   
> fastmailusercontent.com

Fastmail hasn't been on .fm since at least 2017 I think, which dates this file to around that time.

Microsoft's web services still take the cake for most number of third-party domains that are required to log into their services. I think I even need more than when I [first checked](https://rubenerd.com/owa-and-noscript/).
