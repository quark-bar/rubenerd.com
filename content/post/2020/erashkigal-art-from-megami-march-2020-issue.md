Clara and I were at Kinokuniya today, to make ourselves feel better over having to cancel our 2020 Japan trip. The world has far bigger problems than us losing our annual leave to our favourite place in the world, but it still made us sad.

Anyway, we came *this close* to getting the March 2020 issue of the Megami art magazine just for this picture of *Ereshkigal* from the Fate/Grand Order Babylonia TV adaptation. If she looks familiar, it's who [Clara cosplayed](https://rubenerd.com/anime-festival-sydney-2020/) last weekend! Maybe we still should. Uh oh.
