Australia's most famous and widely-travelled steam locomotive is the green, streamlined, cat-whiskered 3801 from New South Wales. She's the only locomotive to have travelled to every mainland state and territory, and even got a mention from the state premier about the importance of restoring her again after years of boiler problems. I hope they're able to.

But the 3801 still plays runner up to my favourite, the Victorian Railways R-761. There's something about her styling and clean lines that even as a kid I thought looked futuristic and cool. For someone growing up with Thomas, her distinctive red smoke deflectors almost looked like ears. And the detail of the SCOA-P wheels are like nothing I'd seen before.

Both even steamed alongside the *4472 Flying Scotsman* during Australia's Bicentennial celebrations in 1988. I was alive at the time, but I wouldn't have remembered or known what was going on even if I'd seen it, gah!

Anyway today I noticed you can get an HO-Scale locomotive from [Eureka Models for AU $759.00](https://www.australianmodeller.com.au/products/eureka-models-vr-r-class-r761-with-sound?variant=853774719), complete with sounds! She looks amazing:

A decade ago I would have looked at that price and said *hell no!* But now I can appreciate why; these would take so much care and attention to make, and they wouldn't exactly be recouping money with economies of scale. Economies of HO scale! **AHAHA!** **Haha!** Hah.

They're out of stock right now, and I doubt I'd ever be buying one at that price point. But she's going on the wishlist on the absolute off chance that someone is generous :).
