It was wonderful having hampered visibility on account of water vapour over [bushfire smoke](https://rubenerd.com/tag/bushfires/) for the first time in months. Photo below taken in Chatswood in the early morning, and Wynyard later in the day.

The Rural Fire Service was also reporting the torrential rain has [put out thirty fires](https://twitter.com/NSWRFS/status/1226731913378840577) over the last few days.

Let's not get complacent though. This all happened because humans continue to screw with the environment with reckless abandon, which is counterproductive at best because we happen to *live* and grow our food in it.
