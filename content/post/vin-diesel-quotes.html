<p>Some good quotes from The Late Show with David Letterman when Dave interviewed Vin Diesel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;A man who represents himself in court has an idiot for a client.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;So my date pulls up in a car with a guy. I know, I know. Anyway she said he was her driving teacher. Huh? Ha! Huh?</p>
<p>Guess I’m the only one who’s had that. Damn.&#8221;</p>
