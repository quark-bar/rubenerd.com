<p>Having <a href="http://rubenerd.com/anime-bakemonogatari/">only just posted about Bakemonogatari</a> I found an infinitely cooler image of Hitagi, this time drawn by <a href="http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=5357138">Yusao</a> who&#39;s more well known for robotic whatnot.</p>
<p>Ever since I was a little kid I&#39;ve loved these colours which has given more than a few people the wrong idea, if you fathom. It&#39;s part of the reason I loved <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com.au/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=7481">Sola</a> in 2007 so much. I really hope I like this series, the graphics are awesome.</p>
