<p>Via @Damncabbage on Twitter, comes this <a href="http://careers.wewantsugar.com/jobs/4413-lead-software-engineer-technical-sugar-singapore">delightful job offer</a> from some sugary application company. Point one describing who they want:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://careers.wewantsugar.com/jobs/4413-lead-software-engineer-technical-sugar-singapore"><p>You are ambitious, intense and entrepreneurial, and you dream of doing epic truly shit with your life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that code? Under who they don’t want:</p>
<blockquote><p>You are a social misfit. You like technology only because you can’t relate to real people. You spend your weekends playing DOTA and in your sleep you dream about your hero reaching Level 38. At school, you were always the last to get picked on any project or sports team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, but it gets better:</p>
<blockquote><p>Having a conversation with you is about as interesting as watching paint dry. Advice: go seek help from a mental health professional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Class. As <a href="http://www.marco.org/2013/11/26/penny-arcade-awful-job">Marco Arment wrote in 2013</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Their unreasonable, immature expectations are a damaging message to send to their huge audience of young software developers. Yes, there are other employers this bad (and worse) in the industry, but you don’t have to work for them. There are a lot of better options, especially if you satisfy even half of Penny Arcade’s requirements — and a healthy work-life balance is a basic requirement, like your paycheck, that you shouldn’t tolerate losing for any employer.</p>
