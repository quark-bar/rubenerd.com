<p>This <a href="https://twitter.com/EXERClSES/status/591376582654177280">tweet from @EXERClSES</a> went mildly viral (is that a thing?) recently. Like all good tweets in 2015, it consisted of a link to an image containing text. For your convenience, I have transcribed them below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Think Less, Feel More</li>
<li>Frown Less, Smile More</li>
<li>Talk Less, Listen more [sic]</li>
<li>Judge Less, Accept More</li>
<li>Watch Less, Do More</li>
<li>Complain Less, Appreciate More</li>
<li>Fear Less, Love More</li>
</ol>

<p>At the risk of violating my own happiness with points 1 and 6, I'd be remiss not commenting.</p>

<p>Despite my progressive hippiness, I never bought the idea that thought and feelings are tanjential. I'd argue the ultimate path to empathy <em>is</em> thought.</p>  

<p>Watch less, do more also seems dangerous. Certainly actions speak louder than words, and your envy would be more productivly chanelled into selfâ€“improvement. As Sun Tsu said though, "know thy enemy". Observation is a critical skill (as point 3 notes).</p>

<p>As for fear less, love more; I think trust would be a better antonym. Which brings me to my ultimate point: never trust anyone who tells you to stop thinking.</p>

<p>I really need to abstain from late night posts.</p>
