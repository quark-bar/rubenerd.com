I just wanted to give a shoutout and congrats to to the [pgAdmin] team for their latest release of pgAdmin 4. The project is also moving to a regular montlhy release cycle.

In [another life] I was an O9i gentleman, and lived out of the Oracle SQL Developer. pgAdmin makes Postgres as capable and easy to develop against as that program made Oracle. There are a few different open source Postgres clients, but nothing is more polished.

It's available as a [macOS Homebrew cask], and for [other platforms]. The [FreeBSD port] is still on pgAdmin 3; I may try building version 4 and submitting a new one.
