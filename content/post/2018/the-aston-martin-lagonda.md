I don't know much about cars, have little desire to own and operate one, and lobby against road infrastructure coming at the expense of public transport. But I can appreciate them as works of design.

My favourite sedan of all time prior to last week was the 1991 Mercedes Benz E Class. It was compact and well proportioned, and had clean lines without looking boxy. Compared to the over-engineered car designs you see today with swooping bodywork and other superfluous junk, this one just looks classy.
 
That's all well and good, but I have a new favourite sedan now, thanks to [Doug DeMuro on YouTube]\: the Aston Martin Lagonda. And here it is for visual comparison:

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/lagonda-exterior@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/lagonda-exterior@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/lagonda-exterior@2x.jpg 2x" alt="" style="width:500px; height:281px;" /></p>

I took a screenshot with Doug to prove I didn't play with the aspect ratio; this car is long, boxy, and flat! It has that 1970s-1980s aesthetic, but its exterior dimensions, wedge-shaped hood, and utter lack of any pretence of visual balance at all between the bonnet, doors, and boot make this such a visual mess I can't not love it!

But this is sometimes an IT blog, so that's where my real fascination with this car comes in.

The driver's seat is **incredible**. The Lagondas were designed when home computers like the Commodore were cutting edge and modern, and its reflected in their advanced — for the time — instrumentation. There are two generations worth mentioning.

The series 2 Lagonda above had the best steering wheel ever, attached to the bottom with a drooping bar. I've never seen anything like it before. The side controls look like rounded buttons from a game console, and the instrument cluster is made of LEDs housed in a drooping hood that could have come from a 1970s arcade machine.

The series 3 is almost as amazing. You [have to watch Doug's video] to witness its green and black CRTs flicker to life, I got a shiver seeing it! And I love the retro-futuristic fonts and rocking switches.

I do enjoy racing games, so I think the next step is to get a larger apartment, and attempt to build a dashboard console and steering wheel configuration like this into a huge controller. I may only be half joking.
