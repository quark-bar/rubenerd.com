Speaking of [overhearing lyrics] in coffee shops, this was from "Gimme what You Got" by Don Henley:

> A man with a briefcase can steal more money;  
> Than a man with a gun.  

I'd extend it to online database in lieu of a briefcase.

I didn't recognise the song, but picked up his voice immediately. He's probably most famous for singing about New York minutes. I've been told anything can change within one of those.
