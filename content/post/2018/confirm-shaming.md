Alongside [misleading email subjects], newsletter popups are another pervasive, perverse dark pattern. You browse a site, only to have a div take over the screen and demand your email address. [Closed Tab; Didn't Read] documents the most egregious examples, and I've complained about them a lot here.

Sadly, not only are they more prevalent than ever, they're evolving passive aggressive language. Simple opt-out links are now routinely tinged with language like *no thanks, I don't want to save money*.

My favourite was [a pet store] pointed out by [Confirm Shaming]\:

> Wet food or dry? Free feeding or on a schedule? How much should you feed your cat and when? Get advice on that and more with Caster's FREE newsletter.
> 
> **Sign Me Up!**  
> **No thanks, I don't care what my cat eats**

The modern web needs a reboot.
