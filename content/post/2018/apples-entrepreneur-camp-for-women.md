Apple has announced its [Apple Entrepreneur Camp], for organisations founded and lead by women. I think it's a terrific idea. From the landing page:

> Research shows that women face unique challenges in technology, especially when starting and leading companies. That’s why we created Apple Entrepreneur Camp, for organizations founded and led by women. Our goal is to help these entrepreneurs as they work on the next generation of cutting-edge apps and to form a global network that encourages the pipeline and longevity of women in technology.

Naturally this irritated a certain vocal group keen to ignore the first sentence. It's incredible to me those who claim to be rational actors ignore evidence; projection is a powerful thing.

And the best thing is, if you don't like it, you don't need to buy their products.
