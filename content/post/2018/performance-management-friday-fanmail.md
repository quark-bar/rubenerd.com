Friday Fanmail time! Each and every Friday, except when I either forget or couldn't be bothered, I post a piece of fanmail sent to me regarding this blog, so that we may all pay witness to their [majestic words].

Today's came from what I can only assume to be a thoroughly legitimate enterprise, based on their professional wordart skills, JPEG artifacting, and aspect ratio.

I'm convinced. But can I attend?

I suppose I'm one of those, but it looks like I'm receiving this message seven years too late! Noooo!
