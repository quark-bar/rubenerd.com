John Gruber [shared] this story from [AndroidPure.com]. From the article:

They outsourced their designs, and passed the savings on to you!

The argument in the past for ripoffs was that a rounded, vertical pane of glass was somehow inevitable. I'm looking forward to seeing what excuses get spun for this latest crop of uninspired hardware.

A Motorola L-Series was my first mobile phone, complete with Infrared to share WAP with my Palm III. It was *so* much better than the Nokias that were popular at the time. How far they've fallen.
