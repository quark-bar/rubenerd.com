Every news story reporting on Australian property during the boom discussed investors, with nay a single toss given to renters, or those buying a home to... get this, *live in*. I know right, what a concept?

The same narrative is playing out now that the market is correcting. I had to go twenty nine paragraphs into this ABC report titled [House of Cards] to get this:

> Tough times for investors are unlikely to garner sympathy from a growing number of Australians who will never have the means to buy their own home, let alone amass a property portfolio.

No kidding. You'll also be shocked to learn renters weren't mentioned.
