NASA has a [beautiful eulogy]:

> Bean, the lunar module pilot on Apollo 12 and commander of the second crewed Skylab mission, died in Houston on Saturday, May 26, 2018. 
> 
> â€œAlan Bean once said â€˜I have the nicest life in the world,â€™" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. "Itâ€™s a comforting sentiment to recall as we mourn his passing."
