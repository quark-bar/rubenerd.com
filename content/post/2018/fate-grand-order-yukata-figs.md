One unintended side effect of [ridding myself of things] is I'm now wary of procuring more. Everything I buy now has to be deliberate, considered, and necessary; lest it become something else taking up precious mental and physical space that needs to be carted around, sold, or disposed of at some point.

**Damn it, Type-Moon!** Mashu's yukata even has the Chaldea logo on it!

Fate/Grand Order is the first, and so far only, mobile game I've ever been able to get into. And it may be an obsession. For reference, the characters above are [Mashu], [Nero Claudius], and [Jeanne d'Arc], linked to the wonderfully useful Grand Order fan wiki.
