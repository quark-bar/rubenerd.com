I've spent most of my time here talking about jazz, but with my sister as my witness, I was *obsessed* with the blues as a teenager. And Aretha and Matt played a huge part in that.

People will likely remember Aretha best for commanding ***R.E.S.P.E.C.T!*** But for me it'll always be that legendary scene in that *Blues Brothers* soul food restaurant when she's musically sparring with Matt "Guitar" Murphy to the tune of ***THINK!***

I legit shed a tear this weekend. What lives and talent. Thank you ♡
