It's [Music Monday] again, that time of week where we take a look at a song I may be obsessing over.

Today we have [this delightful song] by the TECHNOBOYS PULCRAFT GREEN-FUND, with Hiroshi Takano (centre-right above) providing his unique vocals.

Everything about this is perfect. I loved the visual imagery, the shots of all the vintage electronic gear they're using, the endless shots of Tokyo. I badly want to get back there as soon as humanly possible!

And of course, the music is great. Their smiling is infectious! The closest I can describe the sound is soft, happy electronica. 

What a beautiful song :).
