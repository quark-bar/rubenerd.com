Every second podcast, advertisement, and spam email hawk their sponsor's site designs as being *beautiful*. I credit a certain [four-sided shape space] for popularising this, though I'm sure there are earlier examples.

It strikes me as an odd adjective to lead a site design with. Not accessible, or easy to use, or simple, or approachable, or efficient, but *beautiful*. Maybe that term is supposed to encompass the others, but there are better terms to do so.

*Beautiful*, without a qualifier, is hollow. It doesn't stand for anything. It offers no utility. There's a reason people used to say *beauty is only skin deep*. The same thing applies to design, not least on websites.

This isn't a semantic whinge; emphasising beauty in place of other attributes leads us to all sorts of accessibility, performance, and privacy problems. But I suppose you can't argue they're not pretty!
