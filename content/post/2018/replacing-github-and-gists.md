Microsoft bought GitHub. Let's check out replacements:

**[Bitbucket]**
: I used to host on there, in part because [hg is way nicer than Git]. I [moved to GitHub] to learn Git, and because I wanted to contribute to projects there.<p></p>

**[GitLab]**
: This is the new tech darling, but it feels like I'd be kicking the proverbial can down the road. Who's to say that won't also be bought and Skypeified?<p></p>

**[GitWeb]**
: This built-in CGI web interface is bare bones, and I'd miss things like <abbr title="permanent resident, wait, pull request">PRs</abbr>, but maybe its worth going back to basics?<p></p>

**[Self-host]**
: Should be easy enough to do. [Gitorius] looked the most promising last time I looked, but it's been rolled into [self-hosted GitLab]! Maybe I should just use that. You there, reading this! Any suggestions?

It all comes back to when I [moved off GitHub Pages in 2013], albeit with slightly different motives this time:

> It was a fun experiment, but as I’ve repeatedly learned over the years when using other services, I always come back to self hosting. For my needs, it’s just a better fit.

What's unclear is what to replace [GitHub Gists] with. I've been using that as an outboard brain for text files and scripts for years, and find it incredibly useful. Maybe I'll just go back to a *Useful Scripts Desu~* repo for all that again.
