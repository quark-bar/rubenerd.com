I'm clearing out my bookmarks folder for the year. Here's some randomness:

* I couldn't stop looking at this **[beautiful artwork by Shi Yu on Pixiv]**, pictured above. They've got a ton of amazing landscapes.

* A Melbourne cafe was slammed with negative Google ratings when their **[name was used in a year 12 exam]**. Why didn't the exam writers check this first? Seems utterly irresponsible.

* Nvidia classes any GPU older than the GeForce GTX 480 as legacy. You can use their **[Nvidia legacy drivers]** page to determine which FreeBSD X11 driver you need for an older tower.

* **[WireGuard]** purports to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec or OpenVPN. It was originally written for Linux, but now also runs on FreeBSD and other OSs.

* This **[figure of Steins;Gate's Makise Kurisu]** was re-released this year. In the words of a certain Apple executive, it took a tremendous *courage* not to purchase her!

* This **[GnuBee]** device looks like a great, low-cost NAS. This is their 2.5-inch model, but they also have a 3.5-inch version.

* **[Educating Archie]** is one of my all-time favourite old time radio programmes, and it's on the Internet Archive!

* The **[Dell C3765dnf]** — gesundheit — has drivers for older macOS versions, but it still runs fine on Mojave.

* I use Ansible on FreeBSD, and now you can create **[jail hosts]** courtesy of Joerg Fiedler.
