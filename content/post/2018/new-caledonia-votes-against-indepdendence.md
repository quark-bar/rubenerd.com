While Australia was obsessing over its yearly [disgusting horse race], and the rest of the world was looking at the US midterms, New Caledonia voted on its independence. Stephen Dziedzic [filed this report] with the ABC: 

> Early results indicate more than 60 per cent of voters in the territory have cast their ballot in favour of staying with France.
> 
> In a televised address from Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron said a majority of voters chose to remain part of France and he pledged "there is no other path than that of dialogue" on the future of New Caledonia.

[France 24 reported] pro-independence voters was buoyed by the result:

> Leaders of the Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Movement (FLNKS) hailed the narrow vote as a step closer to breaking free of France. Under a 1998 deal called the Nouméa Accord to devolve powers to the territory, two further referendums can be held by 2022.

New Caledonia is geographically close to Australia, and their [economy is larger] than New Zealand's per capita; though its unevenly distributed. I'm surprised we don't hear about them in Australian news more often.
