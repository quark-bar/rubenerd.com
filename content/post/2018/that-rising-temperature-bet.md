James Annan of the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology in Yokohama [placed a bet in 2005] with two climate skeptics. If temperatures fell by this year, he would pay solar physicists Galina Mashnich and Vladimir Bashkirtsev $10,000, and vica versa.

It's now 2018, and those who live on Earth know what the result was. Though curiously, neither have been [willing to pay out] the bet. This isn't surprising, but it's still hilarious!

Climate skeptics talk big — boy do they talk big — but like those healthy popcorn machines or a clean new vacuum cleaner bag, all they have is hot air.
