Want DOSKEY, but with tab completion and other goodies? You want Paul Houle's [Enhanced DOSKEY]:

> This program is an enhanced, drop-in replacement for the DOSKEY.COM that ships with MS-DOS and Windows 9x/Me.  Although enhanced, it has a smaller disk and memory resident footprint.  It is a great addition to DOS boot diskettes, and to the Win 9x/Me environment if the DOS box is used frequently.  Note: will not operate under Windows NT/2000/XP (it's not needed since those systems have completion mechanisms built-in).
> 
> The primary added feature is command and file "auto-completion" via the tab key. 

I've replaced it on my vintage DOS tower's AUTOEXEC.BAT. I know it's cheating a little, but wow having tab completion on DOS is glorious!

What's more amazing though is Paul's homepage with the above image of his rather large pumpkin. I endeavour one day to have a homepage even 1% as good at this.
