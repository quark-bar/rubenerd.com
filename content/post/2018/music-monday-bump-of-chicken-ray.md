It's [Music Monday] time again! Each Monday I relieve what I used to do for my university's anime society by sharing a song I love and writing a brief description.

While we're doing Japanese stuff, *[Ray]* is my favourite song by my favourite Japanese band, the delightfully named Bump of Chicken.

They also did a version with Hatsune Miku which was adorable, but the original is still the best. It's light and happy, and the visuals are just beautiful. I may also have a mancrush all of them.
