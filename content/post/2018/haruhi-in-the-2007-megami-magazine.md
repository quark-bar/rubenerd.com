2006's smash hit *Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu* was the the series that got me [back into anime]. I thought I'd seen all of Ikeda Shouko's art for Kyoto Animation, but her one for this 2007 *Megami* issue slipped under the radar.

Itsuki looks like he's having so much fun being the ace of clubs! Then again, when was he ever *not* smiling? I think we could all learn something from that.
