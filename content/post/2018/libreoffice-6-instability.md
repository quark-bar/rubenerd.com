I was keen to try the new [LibreOffice 6] on my Macs. I have Microsoft Office on here, but only for emergencies; LibreOffice/OpenOffice has long been where I do important work.

Unfortunately it's too unstable to use. Through trial and error, it looks like its a problem with OpenGL. If you leave it disabled by default, it's fine. Enable it, and all hell breaks loose. 

I'll see if I can find their issue tracker and report it.
