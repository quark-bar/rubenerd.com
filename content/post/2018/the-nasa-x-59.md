I was *ecstatic* to sit in the cabin and cockpit of *Concorde* in 2016; albeit one on static display at the [Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum] in New York. The idea that commercial supersonic planes would ever fly again in my lifetime seemed impossible.

There have been economic reasons precluding further development, but noise was as big a factor. Sonic booms generated by *Concorde* limited it to flying over the ocean between coastal cities; relegating it to New York to London and Paris over the Atlantic. The same route as the ocean liners of yore that I will also likely never get to experience. No Blue Riband runs for me; it's a tough, tough life.

But there's research being done to address the sonic boom. Jim Banke of NASA's Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate [announced this research] last week:

> NASA’s newest experimental aircraft, designed with quiet supersonic technology and intended to help open a new era in faster-than-sound air travel over land, will forever be known in the history books as the X-59 QueSST. [..]
>
> Now under construction by Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company at its famed Skunk Works plant in Palmdale, Calif., the X-59 QueSST is designed so that when flying supersonic, people on the ground will hear nothing more than a sonic thump – if anything at all. 

I'm fascinated to see how they pull this off. Presumably one can't just *pull off* sonic boom from a plane; it'll take engineering prowess and ingenuity to accomplish its removal.
