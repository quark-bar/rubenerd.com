I was trying to find the official website for the world's best desktop operating system in the [Wayback Machine], and these were the suggestions I got:

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/beos-archiveorg-suggest@1x.png" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/beos-archiveorg-suggest@1x.png 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/beos-archiveorg-suggest@2x.png 2x" alt="techstocks.com, become.co.jp, becomegorgeous.com, become.com, loantoolbox.com" style="width:500px" /></p>

They're all irrelevant, but I love the non-sequitur of the last one. That's right, Mr Peabody!
