I saw this message in lieu of an *Apple Support Communities* page. It looks sharp on a Retina screen here because its scaled 50%; the original graphic was stretched like it was living in 2009. Also note the skeuomorphic paper, a term likely 90% of tech pundits didn't know prior to iOS 7.

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/apple-support-communities.png" alt="We'll be back. We are busy updating Apple Support Communities for you and will be back shortly." style="width:303px; height:305px;" />

Maybe this graphic is one of the things Apple is busy updating.
