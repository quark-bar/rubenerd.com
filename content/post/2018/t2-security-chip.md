Apple's [T2 Security Chip Security Overview] notes on their T2 security chip had this pragmatic gem that made me smile:

> All Mac portables with the Apple T2 Security Chip feature a hardware 
> disconnect that ensures that the microphone is disabled whenever the lid 
> is closed. This disconnect is implemented in hardware alone, and
> therefore prevents any software, even with root or kernel privileges in
> macOS, and even the software on the T2 chip, from engaging the microphone
> when the lid is closed. (The camera is not disconnected in hardware
> because its field of view is completely obstructed with the lid closed.)
