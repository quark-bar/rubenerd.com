If you've got a Xen domU [misbehaving], you can force an ACPI shutdown with the `-F` option.

For example, say you have the following:

    Name                  ID   Mem VCPUs  State Time(s)

To force shutdown domain 32:

    # xl shutdown -F 32  
    ==> /usr/lib/xen-4.9/bin/xl: invalid option -- 'F'
    ==> unknown global option

Or at least, I thought we could. Since when was `-F` an invalid option? Surely it wasn't a regression, or compatibility issue between the xm and xl toolstacks. I thought xl was broadly a drop-in replacement?

 Hey, wait a minute:

    # xl -F shutdown 32
    ==> Shutting down domain 32

I swear half my problems stem from misordered parameters. You should see me with `dd` when I'm [alone at night], it's late, and the decaf coffee failed to *placebo effectavise*. I'm fairly sure that isn't a word.

In my defence, *force* is an action to be applied to shutdown, so it looks like it should follow. There's also precedent for this order, for example:

    # diskutil unmount force
    # zfs umount -f
    # luxadm remove_device -F enclosurename,[f|r]slot#
    # ruben-moose.pl birdistheword --force
