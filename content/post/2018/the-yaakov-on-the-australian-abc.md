The [imitable @yaakov_h] on Twitter, who's avatar is far handsomer than mine, rendered this observation of my recent [Australian ABC] post:

Damn it!

ABC in this context referrs to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. My server stats indicate most of my readers are in North America, so I wanted to disambiguate it from the American ABC. Damn it, I did it again.
