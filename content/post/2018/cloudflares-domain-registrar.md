Here's some [interesting news] for those of us with all too many domain names:

> Cloudflare Registrar lets you securely register and manage your domain names with transparent, no-markup pricing that eliminates surprise renewal fees and hidden add-on charges.

Most of this Hover already does beautifully. I only moved to Namecheap because Hover don't bill in AUD or SGD, and I was being slugged international charges each time.

At-cost renewal is an interesting idea. I assume they're using it as a gateway drug to get you using their other services, or to garner free advertising. As opposed to garner-free advertising, which would be advertising entirely devoid of garners.
