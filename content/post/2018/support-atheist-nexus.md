I got this worrying email from Richard Haynes this morning:

> More than half of Atheist Nexus's funding is now gone. For ten years, most of our expenses have been paid by purchases made through our Amazon Associates link. Unfortunately, Amazon has changed their policies and now this source of income is gone.
> 
> In 2019, Atheist Nexus turns ten-years-old, and we continue to be one of the few online havens for those fearing “coming out” as nonbelievers. We have more than 32,000 members, 1100+ specialized groups, and a 17,000+ member Facebook group. We do all of this on a shoestring budget and have not needed to do a fundraiser for a couple of years.
> 
> If you are able, please consider helping us out. You can help by [upgrading] your Nexus membership, and/or by giving to this [Gofundme campaign]. 

I was lucky to grow up in a supportive, deistic/agnostic family. Coming out as an atheist or nonbeliever can be a terrifying experience, from family ostracisation to threats of violence depending on where you are and the religion you're withdrawing from. Having a support network is absolutely critical.

If you have a spare few bucks, please consider throwing it their way. The entire community there is supportive and lovely, it would be an incredible shame to lose this resource for people in need.
