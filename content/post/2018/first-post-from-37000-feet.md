I'm flying from Sydney to San Francisco, to work from the company's US office for a while. United has in-flight Wi-Fi and powerpoints, so I can post from the sky for the first time. What a time to be alive.

The view is decidetly less interesting than drinking coffee at [Bryant Park], [Victoria Peak], [Namba Parks], under [Tokyo sakura], or the [Boat Deck Cafe] in Adelaide, not least because I find myself in the middle row on the isle without a window. But it's... higher!
So have a screenshot from the Wi-Fi login screen instead.

I like following the little inflight entertainment system map. We've made course changes a few times:

1. Followed Australian coast to the QLD border
2. Then to the right over [New Caledonia]
3. Then over [Suva, Fiji]
4. Then just to the left of [Apia, Samoa]
5. And now over a lot of nothing!
6. Eventually, according to the map, Hawaii

I assumed it could be for <abbr title="Extended Operations">ETOPS</abbr> reasons, but [this Boeing PDF] suggests that's not a concern anymore. Because I could download a PDF and read it on a plane! Wild.
