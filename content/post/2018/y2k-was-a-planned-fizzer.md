Speaking of [retrospectives], it's now nine years after Harry McCracken's [nine year Y2K retrospective]. Emphasis added:

> If ever a decade began dumb, it was this one. When clocks struck midnight on January 1st and the dreaded Y2K bug turned out to be nothing but a mild irritant, it proved once again that the experts often don't know what the heck they're talking about.
> 
> Whouda thunk it? **It turns out that the world has addressed the Y2K problem remarkably well.** Those who predicted widespread starvation, utility failures, medical emergencies, and financial catastrophy probably feel a tad sheepish. And/or disappointed.

That part is routinely overlooked by pundits gleefully remembering how uneventful and overblown Y2K turned out to be. The same reporters who I'm sure were predicting gloom and doom beforehand.

It was a fizzer because those of us in IT did our jobs.
