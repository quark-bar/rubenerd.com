I know, never read the comments. But [this one left on the Fedora Magazine] site was a work of art; name withheld:

> Why publicize a command line calculator in a time when the computer should read the mind of people and execute the operation ( i’m exceeding, I know ). There are already, formidable and computational complex online tools that allow to do this, see wolfram. Or very complex software like matlab even if not free. What I perceive is that linux doesn’t have innovation to offer than a calculator and this is quite sad Cit “Is this (is) the end my only friend”

`bc` is a supremely useful command line calculator that's great for quick one-liners, or for inclusion in scripts.

I've only written two other calculator posts here, one on [xcalc in 2011], and on [galculator in 2014].
