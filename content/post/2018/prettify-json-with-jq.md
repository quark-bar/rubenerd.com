[Stephen Dolan's jq] is a great little shell utility that, among other things, can prettify JSON. For example, piping this summary from VirusTotal:

    echo '{"resource":"https://rubenerd.com/","scan_date":"2018-08-11 04:33:43","positives":0,"total":67}' | jq

And you get this pretty JSON:

    {
      "resource": "https://rubenerd.com/",
      "response_code": 1,
      "scan_date": "2018-08-11 04:33:43",
      "positives": 0,
      "total": 67
    }

It also works well for multiple nested attributes. You can use `indent` option to set a custom number of spaces, or `tab` if you're a monster. The manpage(1) is also excellent.

I usually use [JSON:XS], but this works in a pinch.
