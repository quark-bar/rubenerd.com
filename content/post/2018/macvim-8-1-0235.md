We got a new [MacVim], thanks to [these fine people]. From the changelog:

> 
> \- Vim patch 8.1.0235
> \- Touch Bar support #715
> \- Force click support #716
> \- New guioption 'k' #708
> \- Fix CoreText renderer
>
> Script interfaces have compatibility with these versions
> 
> \- Lua 5.3
> \- Perl 5.18
> \- Python2 2.7
> \- Python3 3.7
> \- Ruby 2.5

In my morning brain state I thought *wow, that's a lot of Mac-specific updates for Vim* before remembering this is MacVim, and is the entire point of the package.

*(The icon is not official, it's a [replacement by Drew Yeaton] I've been using for many years. Technically its Vim-based no vi, but I let that slide because it looks so cool. In a TextMate nostalgia kind of way).*
