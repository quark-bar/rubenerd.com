I got some feedback from my [confirmation shaming] post. [Steven Dorst]\:

> Ayup. I too am getting annoyed by Confirm Shaming. 

And [David Demster]\:

> It's not worth the energy to be annoyed.

Good attitude to have, and one I continue to fail at cultivating.

> But I do notice such vendors and will not give them my business. Apparently, they would rather be rude.

Agreed. I already closed tabs when people throw lightboxes at me; this kind of language will guarantee I'll vote with my wallet.
