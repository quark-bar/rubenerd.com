There were two vessels I always wanted to see, ever since I was a kid and pouring over engineering books my parents would buy me for birthdays and such. A Concorde, and the RMS Queen Mary. I finally got to sit in the cockpit and cabin of one when Clara I went to New York in 2016. And last week Clara and I saw the 

The Queen Mary was a pivotal liner in so many ways. She was laid down in the early 1930s, and was the first ship built for the combined Cunard White Star line, the former of which operated such legendary ships as the Lusitania, and the latter the Titanic. Other than being oil fired, her propulsion system was an evolition of those fitted to those earlier ships, as was her decor and external design.

Every other ship from that time period was either sunk or scrapped, but Queen Mary was bought by the city of Long Beach for conversion into a convention centre and hotel. This did mean her boiler rooms and some of her other amenties were scrapped, but the fact a ship from that time period was otherwise preserved.

I was already in San Francisco, and Clara was in Los Angeles for her Anime Expo. So we decided to meet, in no small part so I could checl.

The books and photos did not prepare me for the sheer size of the ship.
