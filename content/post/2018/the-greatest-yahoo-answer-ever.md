I was looking for LCR meter reviews, like a gentleman, and stumbled upon [this Yahoo! Answers question]\:

> What is the main difference between a multimeter and a LCR meter? 

What do you reckon the answers were? Take a seat, these are great:

> A multi meter [sic] checks for volts, amps and ohms. Don't know what a LCR meter is.

If you don't know what it is, *why did you answer!?* What runs through the minds of these people? Are they doing it for the answer count, assuming there is one?

But this answer, *this one*, takes the cake. If you're taken the aforementioned seat based on my previous advice, strap in:

> Go look it up

If you needed a four word summary for answer sites, there you have it.
