The affectionately-nicknamed Robot Building in Bangkok is among the weirder, more interesting ones I've ever seen iRL. I found out it's currently occupied by UOB while doing my [blog post about them] last week.

For those interested in a 3D model for their CAD project or game, [Hum3D has a legit 3D model] you can download, complete with those robotic-looking eyes. From the description, you get:

> The 3d model based on a real building created according to original dimensions.
> 
> All main parts of the model are separated objects. Therefore, you can easy change all materials. We provide several formats for each model, most of them available by default.
> 
> Images rendered with using V-Ray plugin (we don't include lighting and environment to a set).

A game using this model gaining sentience would be scarily fascinating.
