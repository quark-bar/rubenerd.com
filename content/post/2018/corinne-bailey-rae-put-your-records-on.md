It's [Music Monday]! I missed last week, gomen. I've decided to mix things up a bit and make these weekly features not just about music I love, but songs I might still be thinking about.

I wasn't that into Corinne Bailey Rae's "[Put Your Records On]". It's fine, but it irks me when singers change registers to repeat a chorus or verse. My dearly departed late mother, herself a fabulous musician an artist, said songwriters use it as a crutch, presumably when they have a [Spandau Ballet moment] and *find it hard to write the next line*.

*(OneRepublic's "[Counting Stars]" is a another egregous example, but they pile on the cringe by doing in falsetto. I thought they were better than that!)*

I vaguely remember hearing this song *everywhere* when I moved back to Sydney, but it's enjoying a resurgence. I've been hearing it again in coffee shops, on the radio in cabs, and through the headphones of train commuters pressed against me in the [morning peak].
 
I'd assumed it was from the late 1990s based on its musical style. I lack sufficient musical vocabulary to articulate why it sounds like that, but take a listen and see if you agree. Regardless, I ran Shazam after hearing it for the third time today, and it came out in 2006. I would not have guessed that at all!

I'm also warming to it it a bit. We need all the warmth, optimism, and smiles we can get in 2018. Though I'd say this [beautiful electronica tune] still has it beat!
