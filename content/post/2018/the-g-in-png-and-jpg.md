I had a series of shower thoughts this morning, in the shower no less. Or would it be no fewer, given I have a known quantity of showers?

* **PNG** and **JPG** are both graphics formats with abbreviations ending with G, but for entirely different reasons.

* **GIF** begins with G, but for the same reason **PNG** ends with G. And not the same reason **GNU** begins with G, which is a recursive acronym for something else, which it itself isn't the same as the G in **PNG**.

* Some people pronounce **PNG** as a vaguely network-sounding acronym, others just spell out the letters. I do the latter.

* And then you have **BMP**, which refers to graphics as **Picture** instead; and **TIFF**, which now that I think about it I can't remember what it stands for.
