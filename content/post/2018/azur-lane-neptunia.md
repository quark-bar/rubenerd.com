I left Twitter for a few weeks, and it seems half my feed is basically *Azur Lane* and lamentations on the current decaying state of global politics.

With all of us primed and used to the idea of **immunocompromised** ship characters, or at the very least willing to suspend disbelief in new and bizarre ways, it makes sense another series would enter the scene to challenge the incumbent *[Kancolle]*.

That term was supposed to be **anthropomorphised**, but it was autocorrected to a somewhat less desirable attribute. I suppose if we're presupposing the existence of ship girls, the idea that bacteria torpedos could compromise a ~~hull~~ immune system doesn't sound far fetched.

First, is a term you shouldn't use to start a sentence. I also didn't realise that *Azur Lane* wasn't even a Japanese mobile game to begin with:

> [Azur Lane] is a Chinese mobile game developed by Shanghai Manjuu & Xiamen Yongshi [..] Upon its release in Japan, this game has become vastly popular; this game began selling its official goods at the 93rd Comiket As of January 12th 2018, the players on Japanese server has boomed to 5 million registrations.

Their heel rudders are what do it for me.

And now for the point of this post. *Azur Lane* is now [doing a collaboration] with... wait, I need to explain this too.

See, in addition to series about anthropomorphised war ships, there's a series of games and an anime revolving around characters who are [CPUs, consoles, and networking equipment], who are of course bishoujo. Clara and I made it through the first few anime adaptation episodes before the suspension of disbelief went full [Galloping Gertie].

So for a limited time in January 2018, you'll be able to [play ship versions] of that *Hyperdimension Neptunia* series in *Azur Lane*, of whom Purple Heart is pictured above. So you can mix your post-World War II era ship girls with computer hardware components that now fly with attached...
