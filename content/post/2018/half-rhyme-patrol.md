My mum imparted several words of wisdom before moving off this mortal coil. Always leave the last button on a blazer undone. [Gotten] isn't a word. And half-rhymes aren't rhymes, and have no business being in songs.

In this post, we'll explore some recent(ish) examples that employ half-rhymes in a *chorus*, which therefore repeats the cringe many times!

Foster the People's *Pumped Up Kicks*, famous for holding the Guinness record for longest song sung through a crappy telephone:

> All the other **kids**;  
> With their pumped up **kicks**. ♫

*Stitches* by Shawn Mendes:

> I'm without your **kisses**;  
> I'll be needing **stitches**. ♫

And *We Are Young* by Fun:

> So let's set the world on **fire**.  
> We can burn **brighter**;  
> Than the sun ♫

I'm still painfully sad she's not around, but at least she avoided these lyrical monstrosities.
