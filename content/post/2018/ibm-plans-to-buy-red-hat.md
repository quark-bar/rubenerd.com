[From the press release]\:

> IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), the world’s leading provider of open source cloud software, announced today that the companies have reached a definitive agreement under which IBM will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Red Hat for $190.00 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $34 billion.

They assure us nine paragraphs in:

> With this acquisition, IBM will remain committed to Red Hat’s open governance, open source contributions, participation in the open source community and development model, and fostering its widespread developer ecosystem. In addition, IBM and Red Hat will remain committed to the continued freedom of open source, via such efforts as Patent Promise, GPL Cooperation Commitment, the Open Invention Network and the LOT Network.

But the overarching theme is cloud; the word appears forty-eight times. I guess that's where their focus is.

I'm still mentally processing this, but wow. All I could think of early this morning was *Red Hat AIX!*

### Random followup thoughts

* [Red Hat Forum Sydney 2018] might have some interesting new talks.

* The press releases are quick to mention Kubernetes, but not my beloved Ansible. D'oh.
