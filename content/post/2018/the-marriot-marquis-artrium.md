And speaking of [old bookmarks], here's one from 2012. You're looking up towards the ceiling of the atrium in the Marriot Marquis in Atlanta. It reminds me a little of the Pan Pacific in Singapore, if it were far taller and somewhat more sinister in its brutalism.

Between this, the Delta Flight Museum, and dropping in to see Alton Brown live, I may need add Atlanta to the travel list next time we're up there!

Thanks to [MyStudentBody] for the photo.
