The only mobile game I play, and have ever got into, is *[Fate/Grand Order]*. Think *Hearthstone*, but with cute characters and familiar themes if you grew up watching the *Fate* franchise. And before you judge me, [Clara] is in way deeper than me!

I had been hoarding my saint quartz all year for *[Nero Fest 2018]*. I played the first Nero Fest as soon as the English version of the game came out, when Clara and I were waiting for the Matsuri to set up in Kyoto if you can believe it. Mashu is best girl, but Nero Claudius is easily the second.

I didn't get [Nero Bride] \(above), but I did get **three** more [Nero Claudii] \(top), so I was able to [NP] ascend her. I took it as a sign, so I also [grailed] her. She's now the equivalent level of a five star servant she deserves to be.

It's also now completely official, I thought I'd always be a Takashi Takeuchii fan first, but [Wadarco] does all my other favourite art in this franchise. The eyes she draws are so *expressive*.
