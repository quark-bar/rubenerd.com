*<strong>UPDATE:</strong> I've since been told an [even better way].*

I script as much as possible for *Rubenerd*, including image processing. This is how I've been concatenating images side by side for the longest time:

	$ montage -border 0             \
		-geometry x$_ORIGINALHEIGHT \
		-tile 2x                    \
		$_IMAGE1 $_IMAGE2           \
		out.ext

But there's an easier way!

	$ montage -mode concatenate $_IMAGE1 $_IMG2 $_OUT

I don't have an install to try in GraphicsMagick, but my hunch is its ImageMagick-specific.

More code or lines in your scripts are rewarding, but not half as much as being able to take lines out.
