Imagine I'm using my old man voice: *back when I was a kid, I used to get so excited going to the Apple website after a new Mac came out!* I do to an extent today, but it's tinged with slight trepidation. What regressive design trend have they introduced, etc?

Today's journey into cautious optimism was checking if the new MacBook Airs had the same Touch Bar as the new MacBook Pros. It took scrolling about 40% of the way down the page, but fortunately the answer is no! Ignore the ugly colour and check out the top-right corner:

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/macbookair-uglycolour@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/macbookair-uglycolour@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/macbookair-uglycolour@2x.jpg 2x" alt="Top view of the new MacBook Air" style="width:420px; height:294px;" /></p>

It has Touch ID, which is the only reason any of us want the Touch Bar, but without the gimmicky screeen and awkward Esc key. They still use those problematic butterfly keys, but two steps forward, one step back.

Which reminds me, I need to hurry up and get a 2015 15" MacBook Pro before the last surviving specimens disappear.
