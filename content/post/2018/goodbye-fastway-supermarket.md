Today we bid farewell to the FastWay Supermarket in North Sydney. It opened in early 2018, but didn't last long before the Woolworths opened less than a block away on Miller Street. 

Truth be told I barely shopped there, but the cheerful clipart paper bag made me smile every time. Even though his store is but a twisted mess of empty shelving now, he still lights up each evening.

It's a shame he couldn't hold on, I'll bet he would have had more customers by the time the new [Victoria Cross Metro station] opened across the street.
