homebrew-cask-versions lets you install previous or beta versions of popular GUI tools that aren't in mainline [homebrew cask].

    $ brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
    $ brew cask install 1password6

Browsing the casks in the repo, I can see they have the latest testing builds for Firefox, older versions of VMware Fusion, and other [good stuff].
