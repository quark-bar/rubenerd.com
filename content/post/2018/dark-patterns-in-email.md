Harry Brignull coined the term *[dark patterns]* to refer to designs that trick us into performing actions we wouldn't otherwise. They rely upon scummy psychological deception and tricks, and need to be called out!

I was faced with such a pattern this morning in an email:

> **From:** Andrew [Last name withheld]  
> **Subject:** Network Outage

This is serious. A network outage will cause customer downtime, so it's an immediate level three issue. Time to stop eating weekend breakfast with the girlfriend and jump on a console.

So I opened the email... and it was advertising for a new line of network monitoring gear.

Mission accomplished from their side, I read their spam I'd have otherwise ignored. **But what poor form**. And entirely counterproductive, I sure as hell I won't be buying any of their devices now.

*Update:* Spelling corrected from physiological to psychological. Though I suppose it could also be the former if you broke out in a sweat from nervousness or rage!*
