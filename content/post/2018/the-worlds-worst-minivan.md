I have no use for, desire to buy, or interest, in minivans. Or at least, I thought so until my binge-watching of [Doug DeMuro's channel] lead me to this video of the Mercedes-Benz *Metris*, sold in Australia and Singapore as the *Vino*, or *Vito*, or something. I should probably check.

It's the perfect case study into a company not listening to the market, especially in light of vastly better alternatives. It's comically awful, and yet, I couldn't stop watching. Compare and contrast to Doug's review of the [Honda Odyssey Minivan], with adjustable and fold down seats that are an engineering work of art.
