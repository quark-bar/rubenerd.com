There were a few Twitter threads about Australian store chains people miss. My family moved to Singapore when I was in late primary school, so this is a mix of both places:

**Brashs** (Australia)
: Music was important to my parents, and we spent much of our weekends in primary school wandering around their selections.<p></p>

**HMV** (Both)
: Similar to Brashs. The one in the Heeren shopping centre on Orchard Road was a wonderland. I loved that jazz and blues even had their own rooms.<p></p>

**World 4 Kids** (Australia)
: The excitement about going into this store to grab the latest Lego kit went way above Toys-R-Us. Not sure why.<p></p>

**Tuckerbag** (Australia)
: When we lived in Melbourne for a few years, this was our local supermarket. Lots of fond memories going there after school on Friday with my mum to get a end of week treat.<p></p>

**Borders** (Both)
: This one broke my heart. Much of my high school life was spent sitting in the isles in the Wheelock Place branch. I went to the [closing down sale](https://rubenerd.com/borders-bondi-junction/) at the Bondi Junction store.<p></p>

**Pizza Hut** (Australia)
: Pizza Hut was always, and still is, a family restaurant in Singapore. I keep reading articles that they're bringing them back in Australia, but they've been *reimagined*. Because of course they have been.<p></p>

**Yaohan** (Singapore)
: In the former Plaza Singapura before it was refurbished the first time. Their arts, crafts, and stationary section was the best place to get Japanese stuff at the time.<p></p>
