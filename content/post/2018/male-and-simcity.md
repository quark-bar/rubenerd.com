I can't get over [this photo] of Malé, Mauritius by Shahee Ilyas. It looks more like a SimCity 3000 or Cities Skylines map I would have made than a real place.

I love having photos like this as my desktop background on work laptops; they're conversation starters while I'm plugging in projectors or starting a screen share.
