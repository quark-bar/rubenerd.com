*Rubenerd* has reached 586 pages. The 80586 was Intel's fifth generation CPU architecture, and the first to be given a name after they lost their case to trademark numbers.

Our first family machine was a 486SX, but the first computer I built myself from parts as a teenager had an 80586 200 MHz Pentium MMX CPU. I still have it, and use it for vintage stuff. It's still my favourite computer; no machine since ever had the same amount of excitement and joy bundled in.

Why run DOSBox or ScummVM when you can run your retro software and games on original hardware? Don't get me wrong, VMs define my existence at this stage, but sometimes you need to hear the original bleeps and bloops.
