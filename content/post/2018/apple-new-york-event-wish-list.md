Apple have their event tomorrow in New York. This is my personal wish list, which must not be construed as what Apple *should* do, just what I'd love for them to. Though I'm willing to take a consulting role at the company if they so desire.

**A new Mac Mini**
: I use an iMac now, but I'd swap it in a heartbeat for a Mac Mini and a KVM for my FreeBSD/Ubuntu game desktop to make things cleaner on my desk. I reckon the chances are fair. *Result: success! And interesting they've embraced how people are using these little boxes rather than just a "bring your own keyboard, display, and mouse.*<p></p>

**Mac Pro update**
: Even just something saying they're working on it, or they take professional users seriously. I reckon the chances are slim. *Result: Nah.*<p></p>

**Newer MacBook Pros**
: Specifically ones that address feedback from the latest generation, such as eschewing (gesundheit) touch bars, including proper keyboards and more ports, and maybe a nice metallic blue finish for fun. I reckon the chances for all of these are equally and *intestinally* small. That was supposed to be *infintestimally* small, but I love that autocorrect. *Result: Nah.*<p></p>

**Reaffirming the Mac's existance**
: Newer *anything* on the desktop or notebook front would be reassuring, given how it seems Apple has lost interest in the market segment for non-iOS devices. *Result: Mostly relieved.*<p></p>

If they do update the MacBook Air, I'll be interested to see how they're positioned. The 12" MacBook has been their *de facto* replacement, but I suppose it couldn't hit the lower price point. *Result: I guess they're not a replacement after all. Pity about the keyboard.*
