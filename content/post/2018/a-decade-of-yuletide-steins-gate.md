It's another Yuletide season! And it reminds me of [this desktop background] by Karafuru Sekai Designs of everyone's favourite moe microwave time travelling scientists I first started using in 2013. That was a long sentence, unlike this one.

It's now more than a decade since the first date shown. I feel old, though somehow no less fabulous.
