[This answer] on by *Upper_Case* appeared in the Hot Network Questions sidebar on StackExchange:

> Communicating well is not a matter of stating true facts (though that is important). It is about expressing things that are accurate in a way that the other party will understand. It is common, in my personal experience, for technically-minded people (like engineers) to only focus on the accuracy of their statements.

I call this the *not seeing the forest for the trees problem*, and is one of the reasons I originally disabled blog comments.
