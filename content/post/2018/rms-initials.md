I knew the RMS initials were common as muck, but there were even more than I expected. Ones I knew already:

* My own name!
* Richard (Matthew) Stallman
* Royal Mail Ship, such as *RMS Lusitania*
* Roads and Maritime Services, in New South Wales
* Root mean square, used in electric current
* Record management systems

And according to Wikipedia:

* Rights Managament Services in Windows Server 2003
