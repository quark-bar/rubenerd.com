Nestled between 3rd and 2nd street near the Bay Bridge approach is South Park. That sentence structure was terrible; probably because I'm **too relaxed**. The street splits in two, and wraps around this cute urban park which I've found myself sitting at a few times.

At the eastern end there's a Blue Bottle Coffee, the first of their branches I went to, which is outstanding.

I wandered to that coffee shop and through this park on my first day here, it was just what my 16+ hour jetlagged mind and body needed :)
