This is already a week old, but it's incredible. The Australian government's Home Affairs Minister [told Sky News]\:

> Peter Dutton says he has always seen **'parliament as a disadvantage for sitting governments'**, following the final Newspoll for 2018 which had the coalition trailing Labor 55-45 on a two-party preferred basis. 

He's not wrong; holding votes and being held accountable must be a hindrance for advancing any agenda, especially when the public is against you and you've lost your majority.

I'm positively relishing the idea of voting these muppets out next year.
