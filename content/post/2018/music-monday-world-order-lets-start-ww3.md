It's *[Music Monday]* time! Today's is by the Japanese group WORLD ORDER. It's a repudiation of Trump, though it's catchy and great even if you're not political or up to speed with what Mr. Orange is up to.

Their choreography is *spectacular!* And the flag at the very end was a beautiful touch :).
