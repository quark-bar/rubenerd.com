I enjoy throwing brief keysmashes into the Mac Dictionary.app, and seeing what comes up. Here's today's foray into the unexpected:

> foray | ˈfɒreɪ |  
> noun  
> a brief but spirited attempt to become involved in a new activity or
> sphere: my first foray into journalism.

Ugh not a definition of **that**, I wanted the result of my keysmash.

> Gresham, Sir Thomas | ˈɡrɛʃəm |  
> (c. 1519–79), English financier. He founded the Royal Exchange in 1566
> and served as the chief financial adviser to the Elizabethan government.

Huh, so I learned two things today; who Sir Thomas Gresham was, and that Dictionary.app also has bibliographies.

Let's try another:

> Gresham, Sir Thomas | ˈɡrɛʃəm |  
> (c. 1519–79), English financier. He founded the Royal Exchange in 1566
> and served as the chief financial adviser to the Elizabethan government.

I'm pretty sure that's the same one. Carry on.
