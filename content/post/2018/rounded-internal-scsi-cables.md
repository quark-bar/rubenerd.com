Need to connect a series of internal SCSI hardware in your vintage computer, but you don't want to restrict airflow with a ribbon? [PC Pitstop] has your covered:

> Internal Rounded SCSI Cables: For all 68 pin cables with 3 or more connectors, one connector is reserved for the controller and one for the terminator. You will need a terminator unless you already have one. All Ultra 320 cables are fully backwards compatible with older U160/Ultra2/SE devices.

Not pictured are the rounded SCSI cables themselves, owing to the store being out of stock.
