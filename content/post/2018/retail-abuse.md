I had an epiphany this morning, in a free falling water conveyance.

I know so many nice people who still treat retail and restaurant staff with contempt. They talk down to them, get aggressive at the metaphorical drop of a hat, and if the hat is physically dropped, well, here come the fireworks. They don't thank them for filling their water, they roll their eyes at the most minor of mistakes.

Why do people feel compelled to do this? Turns out, my epiphany answers it. Those people I otherwise thought were nice, aren't.
