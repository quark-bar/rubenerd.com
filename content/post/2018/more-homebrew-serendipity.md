I always see interesting stuff when updating [Homebrew]. I had some [serendipity in February], here are some more packages I hadn't heard of:

**[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)**
: Command-line fuzzy finder written in Go

**[git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/)**
: Manage files with git without checking in file contents

**[hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine)**
: Pretty command-line benchmarking tool, written in Rust

**[glowthedarksnorkel](https://rubenerd.com/)**
: Generates random songs from "Weird Al" Yankovic lyrics. Does not actually exist, but now I want to make it.
