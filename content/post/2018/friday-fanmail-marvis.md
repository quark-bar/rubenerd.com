Here's an email from someone calling themselves Marvis:

> I am having a cocktail near your house.  
> Do you want to call me on a date?  
> I have some free time and Iâ€™m excited about new acquaintances.  
> See my location, bloke.  
> Check the link.  
> 
> ?c25ydWJAcnViZW5zY2hhZGUuY29t

See my location, bloke? Paying for a botnet to send your junk, but forgetting to put the FQDN before the gibberish? Classic Marvis.
