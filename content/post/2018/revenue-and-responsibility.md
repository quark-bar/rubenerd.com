Our Kiwi friends across the pond are subject to a court-ordered suppression order. A certain large tech company let details slip, arguably because they index the stuff we all publish online. But instead of showing contrition, they... well, you can guess.

[Toby Manhire wrote an article] exploring the dark side of these companies. This paragraph was especially on point, emphasis added:

> They preach the **open internet on the back of the most opaque machines** in big business. They’ve released a wrecking ball into traditional media, and so the public square, and so democracy. They’re brilliant and addictive, and staffed by some of the cleverest people in the world. It’s hard to imagine life without them. And they’ve hoovered up all the revenue and **none of the responsibility**.

Take a guess to which companies he refers. The fact you know speaks volumes.
