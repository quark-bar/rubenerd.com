Power in much of Australia operates as an energy market. Privatisation promised to introduce competition to drive down prices, and to allocate resources more efficiently.

Clarke and Dawe [delightfully explained it] in 2017\:

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELaBzj7cn14"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/yt-ELaBzj7cn14@1x.jpg" alt="Watch video: Clarke and Daw - The Energy Market explained" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/yt-ELaBzj7cn14@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/yt-ELaBzj7cn14@2x.jpg 2x" /></a></p>

The end result has been higher prices, and well-publicised blackouts in parts of the country during times of peak demand, while power stations remain idle.

The Greens are proposing a [government-owned energy retailer]. Seems to make nothing but sense; if the private sector can operate more efficiently and therefore deliver lower prices, they have nothing to fear by government competition.
