Remember my [rant against cosmetic microbeads]? The illustrious [@Georgiecel] shared [this Guardian report] by Fiona Harvey and Jonathan Watts:

> On average, 20 particles of microplastic were found in each 10g of excreta. Microplastics are defined as particles of less than 5mm, with some created for use in products such as cosmetics but also by the breaking down of larger pieces of plastic, often in the sea.
> 
> Based on this study, the authors estimated that “more than 50% of the world population might have microplastics in their stools”, though they stressed the need for larger-scale studies to confirm this.

And earlier this week, [Laura Parker reported] in National Geographic that 90% of table salts sampled for a global study contained microplastics. One grain in ten. Good grief.

In a breathtaking case of Poe's Law, would you believe this was among the highest rated [Slashdot comments]\:

> Are there any health implications of micro plastics [sic] in salt? That was suspiciously left out of the article for some reason.

Personally, I don't want to eat plastic. But I guess Georgina and I are old fashioned like that.
