This is the best sentence I've written in years:

> I’m amazed that for all the dozens – perhaps hundreds – of keys I’ve had over the years, I’ve only had one other one brand new one fail in this way.

This was on my [recent dodgy USB key post], since fixed. Either I hadn't had coffee yet, or too much.
