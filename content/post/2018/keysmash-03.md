I enjoy throwing [brief keysmashes] into the Mac Dictionary.app, and seeing what comes up. Here's our third foray into the unexpected:

> Gresham, Sir Thomas | ˈɡrɛʃəm |  
> (c. 1519–79), English financier. He founded the Royal Exchange in 1566
> and served as the chief financial adviser to the Elizabethan government.

Wait, that's the same one [we did before], and the [time before that]. Carry on.
