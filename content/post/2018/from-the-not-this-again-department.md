The Catholic Church... you know how this ends. [Nancy Notzon filed this] for ABC News Australia:

> The most senior Catholic to be charged with concealing child sexual abuse — Adelaide's Archbishop Philip Wilson — has been found guilty by a New South Wales court.

I post this in the sincere hope one day we'll be *surprised* by news like this, because it'll be uncommon again.
