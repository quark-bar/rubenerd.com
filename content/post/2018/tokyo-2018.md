It's official, I've broken my [#postaday2018] challenge, never to be mentioned again. I [did it in 2011], but not this year!

But it was broken for good reason, I'm in [Tokyo for annual leave], and attending [AsiaBSDCon]. This is the first day on the whirlwind trip that I've cracked open the laptop to type something that wasn't notes from a presentation, or to charge my exhausted phone. As much as I love writing, exploring will take precedence, especially when Clara and keep adding more places to see!

<p style="font-style:italic">(Photo above is of Clara and I at the Ueno park, with budding sakura and a bag being held with a swish new FreeBSD Foundation handle grip!)</p>

Tokyo ain't no Osaka—heh—but it's an amazing place. Busy and crowded for sure, but it all just works. We're too early for the full sakura bloom, but we saw a couple of trees crowded with tourists! And AsiaBSDCon was everything I'd hoped it'd be; I even got photos with some of my heros. And the views from the Tokyo Tower and other places [eclipse New York]; no small feat.

More details and thoughts when I get back to a keyboard; but for now it's time to look like an awful *gaijin weeb* tourist with a camera and Mashu bag tag.
