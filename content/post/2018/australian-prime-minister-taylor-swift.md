Our conservative prime minster, [on record], during parlimentary question time:

> Those opposite haven’t delivered a surplus budget from the year Taylor Swift was born in 1989, and now they want to shake it off, Mr Speaker, as if there’s some sort of way of walking away from their failure to deliver a surplus when they were in government, Mr Speaker. 

These aren't words of confidence, they're the last gasps of someone utterly out of their depth, grasping for anything to humanise himself. 

I almost feel sorry for him.
