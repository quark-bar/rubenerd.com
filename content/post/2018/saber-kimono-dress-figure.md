It was bad enough that we had [this race queen figure] of everyone's favourite **UMU**! Sorry, I don't know what came over me; everyone's favourite *Saber*, Nero Claudius. And this [unbearably-cute racing figure] of original Saber.

But this Saber fig that's up for pre-order now may the most beautiful anime figure I've ever seen, ever, *ever*. The cranes on her dress are my favourite touch.

I'm serious, someone please change the password on my PayPal account before I buy ten of these.
