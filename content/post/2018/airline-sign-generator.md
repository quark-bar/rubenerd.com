I remembered this old [sign generator site] from years back, and saw they have a slew of new ones. This is my latest creation!

Well, that was less inspired than I expected. I'll try again.

That doesn't even make sense. Sleep probably would have been more productive an activity for this time of night.

As for the plane itself—the *Aeroline du Plane* as it were—you can tell it's a Boeing 757 on account of the fuselage looking like a 757.
