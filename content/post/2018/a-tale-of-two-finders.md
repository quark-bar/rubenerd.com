I've been using Mac OS X, OS X, macOS, or whatever they're calling it now, since the original betas. And I don't think I've ever had multiple Finder processes running. I've had *no* Finders many times, and multiple BBEdits back in the day. 

More curious is the fact Activity Monitor only lists iTunes Helper as Not Responding. I know how it feels.
