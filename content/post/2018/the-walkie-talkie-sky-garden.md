The English Wikipedia Featured Pictures team have been on a roll, like so many quality condiments. I found myself lost in [this photo by Colin], but was lulled into a false sense of security by the serenity.

It shows the [Sky Garden] atop *20 Fenchurch Street*, known to locals in London as the *Walkie Talkie*. I'd tell you it's in London, but that would now be superfluous, and a little insulting to your comprehension abilities.

The tower isn't without criticism, which is to say it's been criticised. By critical people, and critics. Specifically, according to Wikipedia:

* it won the Carbuncle Cup in 2015 for the UK's ugliest building 

* the garden itself was smaller and has less greenery than expected, and you have to book to visit it; and 

* the word *literally* is thrown around liberally these days, but the angle of the windows concentrated light and *literally* raised temperatures on certain points at street level past boiling point.

I guess it makes a better desktop background!
