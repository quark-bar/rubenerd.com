It's everyone's favourite Fate/Grand order servant not yet released on the English version, in this adorable new garb **and** with coffee! [By 天蔵 on Pixiv].

The artist is also on [Twitter], [Tumblr], and [Giftee] for support. I'll be buying some FamilyMart ice cream through the latter just as soon as I can translate it. ^^;
