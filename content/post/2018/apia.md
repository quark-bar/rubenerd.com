The last time I was in the vicinity of Australian television on a regular basis, I was inundated with dozens of ads for *Apia*, the *Australian Pensioners Insurance Agency*. It perhaps says more about the demographic still watching television than the networks care to admit.

So you can understand my ignorant surprise upon seeing the word Apia floating around the Pacific on a map this afternoon. I looked it up on Wikipedia:

The Promina Group, an Australian and New Zealand insurance company (2003–07), formerly had listing on the Australian and New Zealand stock-exchanges. Suncorp-Metway Limited took over full ownership of the group in 2007. [..] APIA (Australian Pensioners Insurance Agency)

That's clearly the wrong one. [Let's try again].

> Apia is the capital and the largest city of Samoa. From 1900 to 1919, it was the capital of German Samoa. The city is located on the central north coast of Upolu, Samoa's second largest island. Apia is the only city in Samoa and falls within the political district (itūmālō) of Tuamasaga. 
> 
> The Apia Urban Area has a population of 36,735 (2011 census)[2] and is generally referred to as the City of Apia. The geographic boundaries of Apia Urban Area is mainly from Letogo village to the new industrialized region of Apia known as Vaitele.

Today I learned.
