It's [Friday Fanmail] time! Today's message came from Charlotte:

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/charlotte-email.png" alt="Screenshot showing an email from a Charlotte" style="width:420px; height:92px;" /></p>

Could it be this Charlotte, everyone's favourite mecha harem star? Who [Clara] has the [figure version] of this picture, and who's character she cosplayed one year when I went as Ichika:

Or maybe a character from a [series I didn't watch] but people told me I should have? Or a much [older series]? Or from a [certain American city]?

Alas, no:

As an aside, I always loved being referred to as a *resource*.

My **Critical Thinking**&trade; is telling me I shouldn't open this unsolicited email attachment.
