This is among my favourite songs of all time, but until today I hadn't seen the [music video]. This is one of the most adorable, wonderful things ever.

I [started this blog] and graduated high school in 2004, when this song came out. Norah Jones and Michael Franks got me through those final exams and assignments. It already seems like such a different world ago.

Given the fun the global IT community is having right now, felt it was as good a time as any to share this.
