John [ended a comment] on a Gizmodo tablet review with the following line.

> As to who is right, Cranz uses at least 12 exclamation marks in this review, which Iâ€™d wager speaks to her taste.

... whoops! I think exclamation marks render text more friendly, but I guess that's just me. I use them liberally.

For those who don't remember, Gizmodo was the outfit that [stole a prototype iPhone], then got precious when they were called out on it. They also used a photo of me and asked if their readers were [willing to look as stupid]. When I called them out for being rude, and for violating my Creative Commons Non-Commercial licence, they [didn't even apologise].

As far as I'm concerned, Gizmodo and their ilk are gutter journalism.
