I loved this photo by Eric Freidebach!

> US Airways 737-200 N213US fuselage section on display at the Museum of Flight.

The 737 is my second-favourite airframe, after the [Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]. I likely won't ever get to fly in a 707, but the 737 shares its distinctive cockpit windows and fuselage cross-section. Note also the simple, rounded rectangle cabin windows; I reckon these are much nicer than the slightly-bulbous ones of most contemporary jets.

What struck me about this photo though was how *slender* those wings were! And to think all its fuel had to fit in that space. Wild.

The [photo is preserved] on Wikipedia Commons, because Google bought Panoramio and subsequently [shut it down]. Of course.
