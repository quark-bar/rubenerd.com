Happy Monday! My grandfather delighted in regaling *facts to add to your vast store of useless information*. I endeavour to [continue] this fine tradition.

The following scalars are greater than 2<sub>10</sub>:

* 1010 1010<sub>2</sub>
* 0o52
* Some bad fish pun, expressed in your encoding of choice *(glaven)*
* 0x2A

Sincerely,  
Ruben
