I'd say *[Fate/Grand Order]* is my favourite mobile game, but to be fair it's the only one I've ever been able to get into. I loved that I could summon the servants from the original *Fate/Stay Night* that left such a lasting impression on me more than a decade ago.

Mashu and Umu are my favourites, but I was secretly excited for the day the English version got Ishtar, the servant broadly based on Toosaka Rin. She was my favourite character from the series, and *[Unlimited Blade Works]* was a spectacular, fitting tribute to her story arc.

Ishtar was also a five star servant, so I figured the chances of rolling her were somewhere between nothing and zero. Still, I saved my saint quartz, and rolled twice without any expectations. In the words of *Star Trek Voyager's* Tom Paris: *no dreams, no disappointments!*

*Fate* was kind to me.
