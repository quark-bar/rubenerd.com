I wrote this in my post about [ed25519 public keys] last month\:

> This doesn't sound all that significant, until you see an example **publuc** key:

I'm not sure what a **publuc** key is. Let's check out [spellchecker.net] for what it could be:

> **bloc**: *Of course it was the same copy that our friend had missed previously, the owner having sold his books en bloc in the meantime.* 
>  
> **pabulum**: *They mean that the public is to be given up, not as a heathen land for conversion, but simply as a pabulum for experiment.*
>   
> **pluck**: *I never saw a crew, though so many of them are sick, more resolute or full of pluck.*

I'm glad that's now sorted.
