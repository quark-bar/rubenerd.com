Here's some fun spam:

> How to Communicate With Overly Sensitive Employees

I was expecting a discussion on pollen allergies. But it's something far more fundamental.

> How to effectively communicate with colleagues who take criticism personally? How to communicate your attitude without sounding defensive, annoyed, sloppy, or rushed?

Imagine being someone who lives their professional lives assuming they don't need to worry about that. It's why I thought House MD was such an agonising show; clue train: bedside manner is a *part of your job!*

> In order to be effective in getting what you want and need, how you communicate both verbally and non-verbally will matter a great deal. 

No kidding. It floors me that even selfishly-minded managers don't understand that respected employees are happier, and will perform better for a company. So isn't it in their interests to do so?

> In this webinar, you will learn about ways to read emotional cues and signals and how to demonstrate empathy and transform problems. This webinar also discusses how to anticipate and handle responses to change.

I guess if you can't have genuine empathy, demonstrating it from what you learned in a lecture is better than nothing. But wow.
