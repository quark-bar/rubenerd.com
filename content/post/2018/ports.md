Every industry has its own parlance, but IT has the additional complexity of using the same word for multiple things. Take this shipping location or a sweet alcoholic beverage:

* Physical connectors, such as an AT port
* Network communication end points, at each OSI level
* Ported software between different OSs or hardware

And to the latter we have:

* Ports between operating systems, such as FreeBSD ports
* Ports between architectures, such as NetBSD
* Ports more accurately referred to as rewrites

I had a dream that I was at a conference discussing disambiguations for various IT terms. They decided physical connectors would be *plugs*, networks would get an acronym or abbreviation given their predilection for those, and software would refer to different *builds*. None of which are ideal.

It's almost as if a conference shouldn't be left to a sleep deprived solutions architect late at night.
