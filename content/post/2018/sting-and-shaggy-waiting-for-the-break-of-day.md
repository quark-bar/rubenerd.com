My coworkers and I are obsessed with this unlikely collaboration album that came out last month. This is the third of [many blog posts] dedicated to each song.

Today we have *[Waiting For the Break of Day]*:

> *You see  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some politicians;  
> You hear  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the things they say.  
> You hear the falseness  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their positions;  
> We're waitin'  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the break of day. â™«*  

We sure are.
