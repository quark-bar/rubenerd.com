> By June 1949, people had begun to realize that it was not so easy to
get a program right as had at one time appeared. It was on one of my
journeys between the EDSAC room and the punching equipment that the
realization came over me with full force that a good part of the
remainder of my life was going to be spent in finding errors in my own
programs.
