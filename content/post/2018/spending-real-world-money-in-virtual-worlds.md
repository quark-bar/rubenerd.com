I found another cache of old bookmarks, some of which have aged in interesting ways. Take this article from the American ABC about [spending money in virtual worlds], published in April 2010:

>  "The idea of spending money on virtual items seems strange at first," said Castronova. "But when you think of it [money] is virtual too. I see a competition emerging from virtual life and real life. Virtual life will remain attractive. But I think real life will start to incorporate some of the things that virtual life is discovering about how to make people happy." 

This seemed so strange and cutting edge in the 2010 world of Second Life and Farmville. But mobile games now make billions.
