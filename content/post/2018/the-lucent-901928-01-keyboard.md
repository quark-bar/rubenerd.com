I was looking up eBay for vintage computer keyboards, like a gentleman, and came across this beige Lucent 901928-01. It looks like a standard IBM 101-key keyboard, but there are a couple of interesting differences.

If you look at the photo above, you can see that awkward gap between the `Alt` and `Ctrl` keys are filled with longer `Ctrl` keys. So you don't accidently hit them, they have the same depressed edge I've only ever seen on `Caps Lock`.

But most interesting of all, there's an additional key on the top corner labelled `Clr/Rfrsh`. I'm assuming that's for clearing the screen, or refreshing a view. I've never seen it before.

Thanks to [azsurplusandmore] for this delightful oddity.
