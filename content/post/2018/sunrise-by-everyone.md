I thought the title for [that Norah Jones song] sounded familiar. This is a list of all the artists in my iTunes library that have songs called *Sunrise*:

* [Norah Jones](https://rubenerd.com/norah-jones-sunrise/)
* [Icehouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqumAEiNh0w)
* [Simply Red](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE3g2zeBVQQ)
* Tony O'Connor (couldn't find a link)

Pictured above is the Tony Taka figure of Kagamine Len from *Vocaloid* I still badly want, but it'd run counter to my [decluttering efforts]. He isn't any of the above people, therefore his inclusion in this post is entirely pointless.

You know what else runs counter? A for loop. I'll step down now.
