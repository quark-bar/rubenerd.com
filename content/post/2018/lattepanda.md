[These look cool], and I love the name. Think of Raspberry Pis, but with a quad-core Intel Atom CPU instead of an ARM chip, and Arduino compatibility. It seems the world is moving towards the latter CPU architecture, but you can't beat amd64 compatibility.

It comes with Windows 10, but I wonder if it'd run FreeBSD, or NetBSD?

* One USB 3.0 port and two USB 2.0 ports
* WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0
* Built-in Arduino Co-processor: ATmega32u4
* Video output: HDMI and MIPI-DSI
* Onboard touch panel overlay connector
* Supports 100Mbps Ethernet
* GPIO:
    * 6 GPIOs from Cherry Trail processor
    * 20 GPIOs from Arduino Leonardo
    * 6 Plug and play Gravity sensor connectors
* Power: 5v/2A
* Dimension of board: 88 * 70 mm/ 3.46 * 2.76 inches
* Packing Size: 110 * 94 * 30 mm/4.33 * 3.70 * 1.18 inches
