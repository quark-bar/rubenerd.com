I booked a business trip with Expedia on Sunday. By this morning, I've received the following trove of messages. Important one(s) are highlighted <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">green</span>.

* Welcome to Expedia! Access Member Pricing
* <span style="color:green; font-weight:bold">Expedia travel confirmation - 7 Mar. - (Itinerary #number)</span>
* Important Info about your hotel - 
* Congrats! Now you can earn rewards for your travel
* Feedback Request on behalf of Expedia
* Review your recent experience with Expedia
* Your February statement is here
* Travel smart and safe-with insurance

Given two of these concerned feedback, consider my distate for spam to be the most pressing response.
