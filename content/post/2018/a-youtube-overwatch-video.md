I watch a lot of YouTube thesedays, albeit in private mode and logged out of The Goog. It doesn't render following channels any trickier, just add their feed to your [RSS aggregator] of choice, and you can stop some of the more insidious forms of tracking.

This caution does have the side effect of generating some random video recommendations. There's certainly a lot of vapid, boring stuff. Or if I'm in a less judgemental mood, stuff that doesn't interest me! And then there's stuff I would have never watched had it not been on the front page; who'd have thunk it?

For example, [take this video] about Overwatch by A_Seagull. I've never cared about first person shooters, and only tangentially know of the popular Korean character *D.Va* from endless amounts of anime/weeb site fanart. 

I was hooked watching this for a solid ten minutes. Not for a long time have I watched something and had *absolutely no clue* about what was being said. I mean it, the terminology was made of sounds I recognised as an English speaker as being words, but beyond that... *nada*.

I wonder if talking to IT people is like that? Network engineers are the worst, but we all have our internal lingo we internalise and regurgitate amongst ourselves. I suppose every major industry does.
