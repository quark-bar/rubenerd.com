Earlier this year Clara and I started *Gintama* again, mostly on account of not being able to remember where we got up to. There are a lot of episodes.

This evening's trip down memory lane was the infamous episode where Gin and Katsura were drafted to work in a bar of a specific persuasion. They wore their makeup somewhat better than I would have, naturally on account of a certain amount of *naturally wavy hair*. And as always, Gin's expression was *perfect!*

Not to be outdone, the episode reminded me of an [anime figure] we'd seen earlier this year of everyone's favourire *Shinsengumi*. Megahouse did an [online poll] for who their next G.E.M. line addition should be last year, and a gender-swapped [Souko Okita] from the *Dekobokko Arc* [decisively won].

I did a genderbend cosplay a few years ago. There aren't too many types of media or social settings where that's considered appropriate! I like that an outlet like that exists. But don't read too much into that.
