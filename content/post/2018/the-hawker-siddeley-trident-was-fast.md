I wish I could draw these like [Emoscopes]! But I digress. I knew this British jetliner pioneered several aviation firsts:

> The [Hawker Siddeley HS 121 Trident] was a British short- (and later medium-) range airliner. It was the first T-tail rear-engined three-engined jet airliner to be designed. It was also the first airliner to make a blind landing in revenue service in 1965

The engineers also mounted the centre-rear engine in an S-Duct, another industry first. What I didn't know was how friggen fast it was, even compared to the current Boeing 777 and Airbus A380:

> The Trident was one of the fastest subsonic commercial airliners, regularly cruising at over 610 mph (980 km/h). At introduction into service its standard cruise Mach Number was 0.88/ 380 kn IAS, probably the highest of any of its contemporaries.

Though to achieve this, it had a lower power-to-weight ratio, so it required more runway to take off.

Fatigue cracks and their noisy engines hastened their retirement in the late 1970s. By then, the [Boeing 727] had outsold it 10-to-1.
