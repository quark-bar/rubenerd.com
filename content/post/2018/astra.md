*This post was originally written on Tuesday. But the flight was so badly delayed, I didn't get home till after midnight to post this.*

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/astra-volume4@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/astra-volume4@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/astra-volume4@2x.jpg 2x" alt="Cover from volume 4 of Astra: Lost in Space" style="width:180px; height:270px; float:right; margin:0 0 1em 2em;" /></p>

Our lead flight attendant just read an ad for a Holden Astra giveaway, with the same lack of enthusiasm I'd feel if I'd recited it as many times as he likely has. Forcing someone to do that surely violates a UN charter.

Thing is, he read it just as I was reading volume four of *Astra Lost in Space* on the Kindle, by the same writer who brought us *SKET Dance* and everyone's favourite character [Switch]. I'd also just finished writing an email to a client running an Asterisk PBX. Okay that last one was a little contrived, but still made me smile.

I don't believe in syncronicities; there are insufficient numbers of them in the tens of thousands of seconds we have in a day to be anything more than noise. But I thought that coincidence was fun :).

And as an aside, a comment on the design of [another small Holden car] was one of my first blog posts.
