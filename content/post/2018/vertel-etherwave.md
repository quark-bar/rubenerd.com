You've heard of [vapourwave], but have some [Vertel Etherwave] which:

> comes with QoS guarantees around packet loss, latency and jitter and provide organisations with control and management 
options that just donâ€™t exist in Layer 3 VPNs.

Through no fault of theirs, I liked that Firefox took their *guarantees around jitter* and did *that* to the PDF! It's as if Firefox has a sense of humour boolean in about:config.
