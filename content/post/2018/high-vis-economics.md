Greg Jericho's [Grogonomics column this morning] had this gem:

> One of my favourite paradoxes in regard to conservative politicians is their strongly held belief that the private sector, not the public sector, creates jobs; and yet, whenever there is the announcement of some new public infrastructure project, they will clamour over themselves in high-vis vests to proclaim how many jobs it will create.
