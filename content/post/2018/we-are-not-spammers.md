There must be an English term to describe those who are betrayed by their descriptions. Like a **prestigious** award winner; if the award were prestigious, you wouldn't need to qualify it. Or an **exciting** announcement; if it were exciting, you wouldn't need to... you get the idea. 

This is the greatest spammer footer ever:

If you have to tell people you're not spammers, you probably are. Still though, I'm tempted to reply to ask them what other companies are in my niche.

Niche sounds like a delightful pastry appealing only to a small group of people. Though why you'd need to peel a ~~quiche~~ niche is beyond me.

Which also remids me, I used to be trolled so much by [Subway Niche] in Singapore; assuming it was an American carbohydrate chain. They had a branch in The Forum in Singapore, which I felt looked just like that [bridge in Moscow] in that previous post. Wild.
