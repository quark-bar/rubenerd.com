It seems like only yesterday we were learning of Seagate's [shingled solution] to get to 8TB. Watch their YouTube video [explaining how it works], it's fascinating. Then conventional 8TB and 10TB drives came around. Now doing some window shopping I found out you can get 12TB drives.

In case you didn't read that, I said you can now get **12 friggen terabytes**. Okay I didn't say that specifically, but my shock and awe stands. Or drives, in this case. Glaven.

My big use case at home is consolidation; over the last few years I've been trying to [pare back everything], not least my HP Microserver NAS farm. Multiple machines are noisy, hot, suck extra juice, take more time to maintain, and need networking; though nothing [IB] can't handle.

I've already consolidated a 4x 3TB ZFS RAID-Z for a mirrored pair of 8TB HGSTs, in part thanks to the wonders of the H265 codec and xz. That was a lot of acronyms and abbreviations. I'm still trying to decide whether to fill the remaining two drive slots with more 8TBs, or whether I suck it up and get 10TBs.

Now I'm thinking I'll need to snag me a pair of 12TB HGSTs once they're available. So much for my [hypothetical modular Mac] budget!
