My coworkers and I are obsessed with this unlikely collaboration album that came out last month. This the second of [many blog posts] dedicated to each song.

Today we have *Morning is Coming*:

> *Rouse yourself  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and get out of bed;*  
> *Track a comb  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;across your sleepy head.*  
> *Clean your teath  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wash your face;*   
> *Act like you're a member  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the human race. â™«*

I love mornings, but they nailed the feelings after a late night! All it needs is to somehow work in some monitoring or failed <abbr title="continuous integration">CI</abbr> build emails to wake up to.
