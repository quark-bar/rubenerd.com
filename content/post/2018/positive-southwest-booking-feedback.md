People are so quick to jump online and whinge about negative experiences, so I thought I'd make a specific effort to post positive ones when they occur. 

Last week I booked flights for a quick trip from San Francisco to Los Angeles on Southwest, on recommendation from a colleague. I chose early Monday morning and late Friday evening to maximise my time there. The website was straight forward, booked, click click, got an email confirmation and an SMS, done.

Then I **read** the confirmation email... and my heart sank faster than the freefall lift that injured my shins back in Sydney. I'm looking at you, *Eastern Elevators*. I'd booked the flights the wrong way, with late night on Monday and early morning Friday!

Phone calls are the absolute worst things ever, so I had a poke around on the website. Low and behold, under **Trips** was a **Change Flight** link. Within half a dozen clicks I had the new flights booked, and at no cost, and without having to talk to anyone.

This may be normal, but it was a novelty for me how easy this was. Nice one!
