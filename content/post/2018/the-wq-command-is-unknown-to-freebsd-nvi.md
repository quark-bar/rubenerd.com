In 2015 I realised there was a [direct correlation] between the time of night, and the prevalence of these error messages in Vim:

    "E492: Not an editor command: Wq"

This also extends to its FreeBSD cousin nvi:

    The WQ command is unknown.

Maybe I should just map all these mistypings to *`wq`* and be done with it. But then I feel like this key combination has won. So I'm going to continue mistyping it, in some vain attempt to ~~maintain~~ salvage my pride.
