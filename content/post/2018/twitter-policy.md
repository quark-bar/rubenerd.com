I'm back on Twitter again, against [well-informed advice]. To make it more pleasant, I'm making my own Twitter policy, linked to in my profile.

**If you're a dick, you're muted or blocked. I know you're intelligent enough to understand what that means.**

This does not constitute my conceding of any point. I've just likely been on Twitter [longer than you], and been through the motions enough times to know engaging with you will be draining and counterproductive.

Cheers!
