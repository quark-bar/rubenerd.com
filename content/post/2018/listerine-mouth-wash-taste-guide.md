The following are the Listerine mouth washes I've tried over the last six months, in descending order of taste.

1. Listerine *Fresh Burst*
2. Listerine *Total Care*

It shows how suggestible I am to colour. Green looks fresher and tastes better than purple, despite *Total Care* being more advanced.

As with all medical blog posts, the following ~~cavities~~ caveats apply:

* This was not paid for by Listerine. If it were, they'd be disappointed to read me approving of Oral-B's decent mouth wash products as well.

* While important, taste should not be the primary consideration when procuring mouth washes. A cup of black coffee would be the winner in this case, which would be less than ideal for oral hygiene.

* The filing of this post in [hardware] seems like a stretch.

* Never take any medical advice from random blogs before consulting your qualified healthcare professional. I say qualified specifically, as an unqualified healthcare professional isn't worth the mouth wash they probably drink. Which you shouldn't.
