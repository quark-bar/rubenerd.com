Today we bid adieu to two semi-recent establishments in the northern Sydney suburb of Chatswood that have since ceased to exist, perhaps akin to a certain Pythonian parrot.

Hipsters don't like the Malay food at *PappaRich* restaurants, but I thought they were fine. The Chatswood branch had the decor absolutely *nailed*, even if they hadn't ever heard of [teh tarik] and couldn't make me one.

And the *Contageous Computer Store* was one of the other surprise departures. They were one of the more delightfully named and fun computer stores I've wandered through in an attempt to relive my Sim Lim Square days. They are no more.
