I'm a sucker for cute bird photos, so when I see one, I blog it. This was from the current Wikipedia [article of the day] earlier this week, taken by [Greg Miles].

I appreciate the diet of these critters, and wish for some of them to spend some time with our local mosquitoes:

> The red-backed fairywren mainly eats insects, and supplements its diet with seed and small fruit.
