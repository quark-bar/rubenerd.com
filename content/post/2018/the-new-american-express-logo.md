*This post was originally written in August 2018, but I was trying to find a closer image of the posters in the MUNI station below. Never mind!*

Logos are fascinating. A well-executed mark is instantly recognisable, communicates what the company or institution is, and has *longevity*; the latter of which designers of late have been doing their best to break.

I was standing at the Montgomery Street MUNI station in San Francisco after work one afternoon, like a gentleman, and noticed something was a little off. And it wasn't just the second-hand pot wafting down from the street, or the curious accent of the computerised BART announcer.

I didn't give it a second thought, and moved on with my life. Which is a blatant lie; I was churning about this in my head more than someone who's business isn't advertising or logo design really should. What had they done? What looked so weird?

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/amex-jellyfish-wynyard@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/amex-jellyfish-wynyard@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2018/amex-jellyfish-wynyard@2x.jpg 2x" alt="" style="width:500px; height:333px;" /></p>

I noticed the same thing on a poster at Wynyard station when I got back to Sydney. But with the aid of closer proximity, I was able to ascertain a few more details. The blue square was now a solid colour, not a gradient. The slightly off-centred text was now centred, and simplified its white outline. I liked these; they kept what was strong about the original mark, but made it cleaner.

But then I saw the thing that had been bugging me since July; the one tiny detail that renders the logo awkward in a way I couldn't immediately recognise. The *CA* ligature was gone!

The previous logo joined the *C* and *A* in *American*, from the lower stroke of the narrow *C* to the bottom-left of the *A*. It was subtle, but worked. The new logo cannibalises the lower stroke of the *C* without that visual balance of being joined with the *A*. It looks so *weird*.

If you look closely, that same angle of attack is now employed on the upper strokes of the *S*, but not on the bottom. The clever *EX* is now a FedEx style double arrow. The elegant Helvetica-style *R* is now an ugly Arial-style *R*. And the vertical spacing between the lines also seems slightly too wide.

*As an aside, I know saying <strong>ugly Arial</strong> is redundant, but it needed to be said in the context of the typeface Microsoft should have bundled from the start!*

I'm flattered they're using *Rubenerd Blue*, and I'm sure I'll get used to it, but its a hit and several misses from my vantage point as a ~~well respected~~ logo critic.
