[Michigan US Highway 45] is the the Wikipedia featured article for today. The accompanying photo by RoyalBroil references Paulding, which I read as Pudding. Royally broiled pudding; that sounds delightful.

If I had some work leave and a bit of money, I'd love to travel around rural America. Especially Whitefish and surrounds in Montana. I could start in Seattle, then just keep going till I hit Boston. Maybe even ducking into Canada a few times for fun, eh.
