Can you spot anything? **One** story out of **eighteen** was about the Mac! And even that was just about how to get one cheaper in a sale. Granted, this is after the recent alphabet soup iPhone and Watch launches. But still, for a magazine called *Macworld*?

I've been thinking about this all week. The Apple I miss isn't some mythical one headed by Steve Jobs where [no design mistakes] were made, it's one where iOS didn't constitute the vast bulk of its profits. We hear internal Apple stories all the time about Mac developers being pulled into iOS projects. Mac hardware has also largely been left to langush despite predictable iPhone, iPad, and Watch releases. I miss being excited for Apple announcements.

I love my iPhones, but I've started to resent the whole ecosystem. iOS is fine, and certainly better than the competition, but I love the Mac. But even the popular press doesn't seemed that interested anymore.

It's akin to being a [Ruby hobbyist in 2007] when Rails appeared. There was nothing wrong with Rails, and I've still defended it in the industry of late, but it wasn't just Ruby. I knew the writing was on the wall when even the O'Reilly woodcut book summarised it as *the language that powers Rails*.
