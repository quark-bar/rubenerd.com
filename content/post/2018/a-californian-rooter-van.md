Australian pronunciations and words are interesting. Much of what we say and spell is derived from British English, or what the internet has come to refer to as [Commonwealth English]. But we let slip with a few American terms that I had to get used to coming back from Singapore, like *truck* for *lorry*, *soccer* for *football*, and we also called our upper house a *senate*.

And then there are terms we share and even spell the same, but are pronounced differently out of varying degrees of necessity.

Take network routers: Australians pronounce them the American way like *rawrter*, instead of the British *rooter*. To *root* someone in Australia is to engage in sexual activities, presumably owing to a root's vaguely-phallic shape. This is also why Americans should never encourage an Australian by saying they're *rooting for them*, unless it's for a specific risqu√© encounter.

And its why my boss and I got a kick out of this van. San Francisco, where people get Amazon goods, restaurant food, and other things delivered to their doors.
