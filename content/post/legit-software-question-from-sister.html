<blockquote><p>ARGH! Why canâ€™t the same software run on everything?!</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course as developers we know why (the lowest common denominator problem, patents, turf wars), and can point out failed attempts to change this (<em>cough</em> Java), but sometimes it helps to see a less technically proficient user&#39;s take on what we&#39;ve developed as software folk.</p>
<p>I suppose that&#39;s where web applications have the potential to shine, provided we move enough people onto standards compliant browsers. I very much doubt we&#39;ll ever have a consensus on a standardised desktop API, though I suppose Win32 came awfully close with a <em>de facto</em> one ;).</p>
