<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/icon.tango.news.crop.png" alt="Icon from the Tango Desktop Project" style="height:77px; width:124px; float:right;" class="transparent" />Despite Dave Winer being an arsehole to me several times (I wear it as a badge of honour!), I have no qualm with saying he answers the question about Julian Assange&#39;s agenda pretty damn well (<a href="http://scripting.com/stories/2011/02/02/doesAssangeHaveAnAgenda.html">Does Assange Have An Agenda?</a>).</p>
<p>Mr Assange and plenty of other people at Wikileaks and other sites are just doing what &quot;news&quot; organisations are supposed to be doing, instead of just being paid off, glorified subsidiaries of special interest groups, political parties and companies.</p>
<p>Those &quot;news&quot; organisations have been caught with their pants down, and they&#39;re understandably embarrassed and frustrated. Its harder for news to be curated and manufactured to fit a preferred narrative to condition readers and viewers when independent sources keep messing it up with facts.</p>
