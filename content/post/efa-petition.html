<p>Given the veracity and frequency of my posts on the proposed <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/openinternet/">mandatory internet filter in Australia</a> I&#39;m surprised it took me so long to sign their online petition. The record of online petitions doesn&#39;t suggest this one will do anything towards changing attitudes, but it&#39;s still critically important we all show our support.</p>
