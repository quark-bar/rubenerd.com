<p>Beautiful photo of a beautiful piece of classic hardware, John Gruber&#39;s Apple Extended Keyboard. I&#39;ve been using an IBM Model M clone <a href="http://rubenerd.com/my-unicomp-keyboard/">Unicomp SpaceSaver</a> with my desktops and a ThinkPad as my primary portable computer since 2009; regular keyboards make me feel like I&#39;m typing on a thawed fish.</p>
<p>If you type a lot, you owe it to yourself to use wonderful keyboards. They&#39;ll do more for your productivity than any other upgrade, and I&#39;d hazard a guess most people don&#39;t give theirs a second thought.</p>
