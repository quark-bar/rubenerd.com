<p>A quote from a <a href="http://m.dw.de/english/mobile.A-16623276-9097.html">Deutsche Welle</a> article I added to my beloved <a href="http://instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> queue ages, ago but only just got around to reading. Use the original and best, people!</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The common goal of all the states in the region is, one day, to be part of the European Union, where we have freedom of movement for everybody,&#8221; [German Foreign Minister] Westerwelle said. &#8220;That is why a redrawing of national boundaries is out of the question, including the Balkans. In Europe, borders are losing their significance.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If they’re losing their significance, what’s the harm in redrawing them then?</p>
