<p>Remember <a href="//rubenerd.com/labor-university-funding-cuts/">my post earlier this week</a> about Julia Gillard and Labor cutting university education spending in Australia? An <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/political-news/abbott-says-no-need-for-gonski-funding-reforms-20130421-2i7wy.html">excerpt from an article in The Age</a>, retweeted by <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Sebasu_tan" title="Sebasu_tan on Twitter">@Sebasu_tan</a> on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>But [opposition leader] Mr Abbott said he would maintain the changes to university funding which the government announced earlier this month as a way of paying for the increased money that it wants to give to primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don’t think anyone should expect those cuts to be reversed,&#8221; Mr Abbott said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surprising no one.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, told Fairfax Media that Mr Abbott was locking children into &#8220;being left behind&#8221;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rich.</p>
