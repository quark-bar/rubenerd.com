<p>Almost two years ago, I bemoaned the fact Yahoo were creating new things, but were still the <a title="Wednesday 20th April 2011: Yahoo still doesn't get it" href="//rubenerd.com/yahoo-still-doesnt-get-it/">only major mail provider to not offer SSL</a>. On an unsecured wireless network, this is an open invitation for anyone to hijack your session.</p>
<p>Well, they <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/kb/index?locale=en_US&amp;y=PROD_MAIL_ML&amp;page=content&amp;id=SLN8558">finally listened</a>!</p>
