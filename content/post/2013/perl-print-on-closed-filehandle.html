<p>This is a common problem I come across when writing:</p>
<pre class="code" style="overflow-x:scroll;">
print() on closed filehandle OUTFILE at ./something.pl line 24, &lt;INFILE&gt; line 46.
</pre>
<p>99% of the time for me, the problem is attempting to load a file in a directory that doesnâ€™t exist.</p>
