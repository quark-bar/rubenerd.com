<p>Remember a fortnight ago when I <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/if-you-see-this-tweeted-youre-luckier-than-me/">couldn’t access Twitter</a> through our TPG home internet connection?</p>
<p>Unfortunately it’s become a persistent problem. Each night around 19:00, Twitter suddenly stops responding. I can still ping and perform traceroutes, but neither my sister or I can use Twitter using our TPG connection on our phones or computers.</p>
<p>This evening, I was reassured (for want of a better word) to see people <a href="http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=2069466">commenting about the issue on Whirlpool</a>. Clearly this is affecting a large number of their customers, not just a few people in Hornsby.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping they get on top of this quickly. Hey, crazier things have happened.</p>
