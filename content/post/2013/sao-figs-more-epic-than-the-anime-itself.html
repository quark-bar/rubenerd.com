<p>To say Sword Art Online was disliked by esteemed members of [our anime club](http://utsanime.net/) would be the understatement of the millennium. Or to put it another way… Y U LIKE THAT!?!?!?!?!</p>
<p>I’ll be honest, I didn’t find it terrible, though they didn’t do much with the otherwise awesome early premise they’d developed. And I liked the character designs. What can I say, I’m a sucker for art!</p>
<p><a href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> and I [saw this fig of Asuna <a href="http://myfigurecollection.net/item/154586">yesterday</a> on the train, and I have to say I’m a fan. The flowing white of her dress, the amount of detail in her hair… it’s amazing what figure artists and manufactures are able to produce these days.</p>
<p>About the only thing boring about this fig is her base, though clear &#8220;not there&#8221; plastic is still better than the plain black bases of yore. I almost wrote &#8220;hitam&#8221; bases, but wrong language.</p>
