<p>For fans of a certain scientific gate (forgive me for that), be warned this is potentially the last year you can use Karafuru Sekai Designs&#39;s <a href="http://ks-designs.at.ua/load/wallpapers/s/welcome_to_2012/28-1-0-114" title="Karafuru Sekai Designs: Welcome to 2012">beautiful holiday vector background</a> on your machine. The line of dates to the right of Makise Kurisu <strong>end with 2013</strong>, therefore rendering its use next year invalid.</p>
<p>I used this image on my workhorse machine last year, and am doing so again now. Thought you&#39;d want to know.</p>
