<p><a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/04/04/why-facebook-home-bothers-me-it-destroys-any-notion-of-privacy/">Om Malik on the new Facebook Home thing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>And most importantly it is Facebook, a company that is known to have played loose-and-easy with consumer privacy and data since its very inception, asking for forgiveness whenever we caught them with its hand in the cookie jar. I don’t think we can be that forgiving or reactive with Facebook on mobile.</p>

<blockquote><p>The &#8220;privacy angst&#8221; folks like Om Malik are wrong</p>
<p>I just read Om Malik’s post about why Facebook Home bugs him. Sorry, it’s time that we stop listening to those who have &#8220;privacy angst.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Privacy angst?&#8221; Class.</p>
<p>Personally, I am supremely thankful we have honest people like Om Malik thinking about these issues, and voicing them in a public space. The true enemy to privacy is complacency.</p>
<p>Don’t trust those who tell you to stop thinking or listening.</p>
