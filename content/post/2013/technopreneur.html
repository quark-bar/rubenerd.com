<p>While reading my email over my Sunday cup of coffee, I noticed I’d been invited to attend a webinar by a networking company you probably know.</p>
<p>To be perfectly honest, I’m not sure I’m ready to take the plunge and become a technopreneur. I’ll have to thinkificate about it first, or at least synchronise some paradigms.</p>
