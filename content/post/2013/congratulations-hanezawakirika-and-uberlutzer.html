<p>Sending huge congratulatory electronic hugs to Clara and a brohug to Robbie for graduating yesterday. There are so many clich&eacute;s about all their hard work, the exciting opportunities that face them and so on, but theyâ€™ve no doubt heard that from everyone by now. Still ^_^.</p>
<p>Clara will be hanging around to do her masters, and I hope Robbie will drop in from time to time as well :).</p>
<p>Pictured above in all their finery, I can tell those colours will suit them much better than they will on me! About the only thing lacking was my cameratic skills. Is cameratic a word?</p>
