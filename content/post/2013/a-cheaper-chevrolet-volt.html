<p>From <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/driveon/2013/01/17/gm-chevrolet-volt-electric-car-cheap/1841407/">USA Today</a>, even though it came out yesterday:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.usatoday.com/story/driveon/2013/01/17/gm-chevrolet-volt-electric-car-cheap/1841407/"><p>Instead of shoehorning the electric powerplant into a conventional GM compact-car platform, the next Volt will be purpose-built. That will allow the ability to better package the batteries and other specialized components, says Mark Reuss, president of GM North America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shows my ignorance, I thought it <strong><em>was</em></strong> purpose-built. The Honda Civic Hybrid isn’t purpose-built, and it doesn’t come with a premium price tag.</p>
<p>To me, this reads like a book coming out in hardcover for the people who really want it, then releasing the paperback for everyone else.</p>
<p>And now I’ve exhausted all my car knowledge, and have lost my train of thought.</p>
