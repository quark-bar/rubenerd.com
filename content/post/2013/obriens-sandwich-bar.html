<p>Going through my archives, I found <a href="//rubenerd.com/obriens-singapore/">this post written from an O&#39;Briens Sandwich Bar</a> in Singapore. My dad and I had taken shelter in their Jelita branch after a particuarly nasty monsoon swept across the island, and we were more than a little fearful about driving on the increasily river–like road near Ulu Pandan. Another blog post from that time has some <a href="//rubenerd.com/singapore-flashes-a-flood/">pretty unbelievable photos</a> from that event.</p>
<p>When I went back to Singapore in 2011, that branch had long since closed shop and moved on. In fact, much of the <a href="http://www.yelp.com.sg/biz/jelita-shopping-centre-singapore">Jelita shopping centre</a> looked completely different. I can still recall having birthday parties in the Pizza Hut upstairs. Sometimes after school, we&#39;d get a cool drink at the 7-11, back when the Australian International School had its campus nearby. Then they moved the school again to Lorong Chuan, which we dubbed the biggest traffic island in Singapore.</p>
<p>Last year, a bunch of us from <a href="http://utsanime.net/">Anime@UTS</a> found ourselves at North Strathfield. Craving a bite to eat, we found an O&#39;Briens Irish Sandwich bar, and proceeded to chow down. Despite being thousands of kilometres away, it tasted so good, and surprisingly familiar.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll admit, part of me loves globalisation just because I can relive some childhood memories in a completely different part of the world. Even locally, if a branch of a store meant a lot to you, you can always go to another if the original closes shop. Sure, its not entirely the same, but nothing ever would be.</p>
