<p>After hearing about it on my beloved <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/">5by5 Back to Work</a>, I finally started using <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/b2w/">TextExpander</a>. Today, I realised it can be used with my lifehacking language of choice.</p>

<h3>Way of the future</h3>
<p>TextExpander lets you assign blocks of text (or even images) to a shortcut you assign. For example, when I type <code>;nc</code> it expands out to all my ncurses boilerplate. <code>;sig</code> expands to my name, address, email, <abbr title="universal resource locator">EARLs</abbr> and phone numbers. You could leave it at that, and be crazy productive.</p>
<p>But you don’t have to stop there. If you create a new shortcut and choose choose &#8220;Context: Shell Script&#8221; from the top of the editing box, you can write shell scripts to process stuff. I ignored it initially, largely for the same reason I eschew (gesundheit) most Western fast food. I can eat it, but I prefer other things.</p>
<h3>Earning some Siracusa cred</h3>

<p>On a hunch this morning, I decided to test the limits of this &#8220;Context: Shell Script&#8221; box and enter some Perl (which of course I inserted with its own TextExpander shortcut!):</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/perl […]
print("Hello, world");
</pre>
<p>When I typed my <code>;test</code> shortcut, <em>Hello, world</em> was inserted in it’s place.</p>
<p>Oh. My. SCIENCE.</p>
<p>That’s right, TextExpander took the output from this Perl script, and used it in the substitution. Think of the possibilities. No, seriously, think of them.</p>
<p>I’ve used Perl scripts, a Dock shortcut and the Mac pasteboard to automate and send results to where I want since 2004. Now I’m going to go through them all and see how I can make TextExpander shortcuts for all of them.</p>
