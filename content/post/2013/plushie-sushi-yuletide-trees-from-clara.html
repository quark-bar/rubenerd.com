<p><a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/11040103913/" title="Photo on Flickr of Sasara and Alpaca with Clara decorations"><img src="https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3794/11040103913_af4196aac3_b.jpg" alt="Sasara and Alpaca with Clara decorations" style="width:500px; height:335px" /></a></p>
<p>For obvious <a href="http://rubenerd.com/dedication%20Rub%C3%A9nerd%20site%20dedication">family reasons</a>, we didn&#39;t really celebrate Yuletide festivities all that much for several years. Lately though, we&#39;ve started getting back into the swing of it, albeit slowly. Baby steps.</p>
<p>To get a head start on the season this year, <a rel="friend met co-worker kin muse crush date sweetheart" href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> sewed us a plushie tree ornament and salmon sushi roll!</p>
<p>The models displaying our new ornaments are Kusugawa Sasara and a rather fabulous Alpacafe alpaca, both of which Clara gave me as well. They seemed like a natural pair to take care of them till we get the tree up. Assuming plushie alpacas don&#39;t eat plushie sushi.</p>
