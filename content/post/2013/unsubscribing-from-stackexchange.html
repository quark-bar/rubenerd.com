<p>I hate the term, but starting in 2013 I decided to be more proactive about the emails I receive. With regards to newsletters, unless it provides information not available elsewhere through RSS, Twitter or the like, I unsubscribe. Synergising my inbox paradigms.</p>
<p>Having clicked the unsubscribe link in a <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">StackExchange</a> email, I was presented with the above image, and a comment.</p>
<blockquote><p>We couldn’t find the page you requested, but we did find this sign that might help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While technically true, I doubt sicking a panda onto my inbox will rid me of your newsletters. That is, unless it somehow overcomes its bamboo addiction and begins ingesting them on my bearhalf.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, having unsubscribed to dozens of newsletters so far this year, errors like this are disturbingly common, regardless of the browser or platform I use. I suppose some sites figure if they make it non-trivial to unsubscrube, you’ll just stick with them.</p>
