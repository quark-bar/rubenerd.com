<p>Okay, that title was a stretch. No wait, that banner was. Jive.</p>
<p>As your studious writer studied for an exam this evening, he began referring to himself in the third person. Additionally, he attempted to download James Andersonâ€™s <em><a title="NIST Closed, NIST and Affiliated Web Sites Not Available" href="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/history/ande80.pdf">Computer Security Threat: Monitoring and Surveillance</a></em> paper from NIST, only to be given this:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/history/ande80.pdf"><p>Due to a lapse in government funding, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is closed and most NIST and affiliated web sites are unavailable until further notice. We sincerely regret the inconvenience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lucky for me, the always wonderful <a title="Computer Security Threat: Monitoring and Surveillance : Anderson, James P. : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive" href="https://archive.org/details/ComputerSecurityThreatMonitoringAndSurveillance">Internet Archive also had a copy</a>. That could have been messy.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic">(As a matter of disclosure, the Internet Archive hosts all the episodes of my <a title="Rubenerd Show" href="http://rubenerd.com/show/">ancient podcast</a>. I would advise against listening to them).</p>
