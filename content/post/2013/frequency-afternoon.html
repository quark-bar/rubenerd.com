<p>Dan Benjamin of <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5</a> is <a href="https://5by5.wufoo.com/forms/the-frequency-survey/">running a survey</a> about <a href="http://5by5.tv/frequency/">The Frequency</a>. In a nutshell, they’re contemplating running their daily news show in the afternoon instead of the morning.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting idea. Morning tech news is a pretty saturated market, so running a news show in the afternoon would be an interesting differentiator. Most importantly, it’d allow Dan and Haddie to discuss what happened <strong>that day</strong> in the US, rather that pouring over potentially stale news that happened the day before.</p>
<p>Stale news that happened the day before… wow, we’re living in the future!</p>
<p>Personally, it doesn’t make much difference. There’s a 16-17 hour time difference between Austin and Sydney, and I tend just to listen to it as a podcast whenever I have the time. <em>Way of The Future</em>.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>Seems I posted this too late, the survey is now done. You can <a href="https://5by5.wufoo.com/reports/frequency-survey-report/">view the results though</a>. Interestingly enough, it seems most people don’t really care what time of day the show is released, as long as it is! That’s a good thing to know if I ever decide to start my show again.</p>
