<p>Doing group work for our <em>Routing and Internetworks</em> class yesterday, all these terrible network memes started appearing in my head. Initially, I included them in our group report, but for the sake of our marks I’ll be putting them here instead.</p>
<p>This is the first one, <a href="http://memegenerator.net/instance/37805754">generated here</a>. You’re welcome.</p>
