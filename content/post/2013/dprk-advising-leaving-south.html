<p>I see. Anyone want to shout me a ticket to Incheon? You can go via Singapore or Hong Kong, I don’t mind.</p>
<h3>Footnote</h3>
<p>I originally included an image of some rather fetching young Korean men, from <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/cute-korean-boy-bands/">this post of mine in 2011</a>. I subsequently found an image of Ayanami Rei in Korean garb, which was also just too epic to pass up. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
