I just left this review for the [Bitsplitting Podcast] on iTunes:

> This podcast is less of an interview, more of a conversation between two great minds each week. Always looking forward to seeing who Daniel will be talking with next. 
> 
> If you're a fan of Daniel and Manton's Core Intuition podcast (if not, what's wrong with you?!), this is a natural accompaniment. Similar friendly, relaxed style and flow.
> 
> Between this, CoreInt, ATP and all the great 5by5 shows, I have my tech podcast diet covered ^_^.
