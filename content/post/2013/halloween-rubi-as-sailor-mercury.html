<p>My family were never big on Halloween. Those Simpsons <em>Treehouse of Horror</em> episodes were rather epic, but the rest of the holiday seemed… meh? I didn’t even realise the name of the occasion was spelled with a double L until recently; to think I’ve been <strong>speling</strong> it <strong>llike</strong> a chump this <strong>wholle</strong> time.</p>
<p>So chumpy you can carve it.</p>
<p>This evening however, <a title="Kirinyan: Happy Halloween!" href="http://kirinyan.net/happy-halloween-2013/">Clara drew</a> her Nyancat mascot as a cute &#8220;Batman like creature&#8221; (to use her exact words). Additionally, and in a way that is beyond awesome, she drew our Rubenerd Mascot Rubi as Ami, <strong>still</strong> my single favourite anime character of all time after all these years.</p>
<p>I’m thinking there may be something to this day after all ^_^.</p>
