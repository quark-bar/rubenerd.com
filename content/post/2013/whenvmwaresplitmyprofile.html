<p>For some reason my account has morphed into two:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://communities.vmware.com/people/rubenerd/">My profile</a></li>
<li><a href="http://communities.vmware.com/people/RubenSchade/">My&#8230; other profile?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This happened after buying VMware Fusion 5.0 Professional. My licences are in one, my (albeit sparse) community posts are in the other. Logging in, I get taken to the second one. I have no idea how to log into the first one.</p>
<p>Me thinks a long and complex road paved with support tickets is about to be travelled. Wish me luck.</p>
