<p>Iâ€™d react the same if I were given a mint Commodore 64 box! I got my 64 (and <a href="//rubenerd.com/c16-unicomp-comparison/">16</a>, and Plus 4) second hand on eBay when I was 18, and have loved them. Born too late for the home computer revolution, too early to have the internet in primary school. Never used datasettes, but had 5.25&#8243; floppies. Feeling sorry for me yet?</p>
