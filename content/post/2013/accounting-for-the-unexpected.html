<p>One evening in late October, I was nearly clipped by a bus on a one-way street. I’d been careful to check the road before crossing, but only in the opposite direction to the legal traffic flow. I assumed that cars wouldn’t drive down a street one-way the wrong way, so I failed to check for it.</p>
<p>Later that same evening, I received an email that appeared blank. I was about to bin it for being junk, when I realised the message curiously contained a malformed header preventing SeaMonkey from parsing it.</p>
<p>Assume, and you make an ass of u and me.</p>
