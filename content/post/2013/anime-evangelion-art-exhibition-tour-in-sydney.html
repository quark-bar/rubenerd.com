<p>Earlier today, the best university anime clubs in Australia (ahem) gathered at the <a href="http://www.jpf.org.au/">Japan Foundation</a> gallery for a sneak peak into some of the original art behind <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>. Seeing the level of detail that goes into each frame, how all the different layers of colours and effects were added, it was an amazing experience.</p>
<p>We werenâ€™t permitted to take photos of the exhibits themselves unfortunately, but the few photos I got from the event are on my <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/sets/72157633468698104/">Anime@UTS Flickr gallery</a>. I have some <a href="http://utsanime.net/">handsome club members</a>, let me just say that!</p>
<p>There was merchandise (of course!), and I was lucky enough to snag a shitajiki (aka: pencil board) to frame on my wall, along with one for <a href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a>.</p>
