<p>This has to be among the best uses of &#8220;meanwhile&#8221; of all time. Read the <a href="http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201306/23/P201306230476.htm">whole government release</a> if you have a spare minute or two, but here are my favourite sections:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201306/23/P201306230476.htm"><p>Mr Edward Snowden left Hong Kong today (June 23) on his own accord for a third country through a lawful and normal channel. [..]</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the HKSAR Government has formally written to the US Government requesting clarification on earlier reports about the hacking of computer systems in Hong Kong by US government agencies. The HKSAR Government will continue to follow up on the matter so as to protect the legal rights of the people of Hong Kong.</p>
