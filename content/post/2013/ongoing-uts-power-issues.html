<p>UTS’s problems with a burst public water main (<a href="//rubenerd.com/when-your-university-lecture-submerges/">When your university lecture submerges</a>, <a href="//rubenerd.com/when-your-uni-is-still-somewhat-flooded/">When your uni is still somewhat flooded</a>) only seem to be getting worse. Emphasis mine:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, Ausgrid’s power problems have the potential to <strong>persist for the next few days</strong>. I ask, therefore, that all students regularly check the following information sources for the latest updates:<br />
1. UTS Library website (<a href="http://lib.uts.edu.au/">lib.uts.edu.au</a>)<br />
2. The SAU home page (<a href="http://sau.uts.edu.au">sau.uts.edu.au</a>)<br />
3. Your Faculty’s home page<br />
4. The UTS home page (<a href="http://uts.edu.au/">uts.edu.au</a>) &#8211; please note the UTS Home Page will only be used if all other options are unavailable
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it’s not just classes that continue to be affected:</p>
<blockquote><p>The power outage resulted in the evacuation of [student housing] (for a third consecutive night) as well as the loss of almost all IT systems &#8211; including the broadcast email system &#8211; making it impossible for the UTS Emergency Team to send a broadcast message to all students.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ouch.</p>
<blockquote><p>UTS is applying a great deal of pressure on Ausgrid and Sydney Water (whose mains rupture caused the power failures) to address their various issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I said on the last post, we hope this gets sorted out soon. I’m already thinking we’ll be hearing about this for the rest of the week.</p>
