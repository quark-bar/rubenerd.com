<p>After a brief hiatus (which you were all most likely relieved to receive), this is the fourth in my <strong>fabulous</strong> networking meme series, <a href="http://memegenerator.net/instance/38439033/">generated here</a>. The <a href="//rubenerd.com/i-dont-always-make-lame-networking-memes/">first one was here</a>, and the <a href="//rubenerd.com/one-does-not-simply-network-meme/">second one was here</a>, and the <a href="//rubenerd.com/the-only-networking-guy-around-here/">third one was here</a>. Youâ€™re welcome.</p>
