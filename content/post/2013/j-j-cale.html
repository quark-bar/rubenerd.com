<p>Of the artists I obsessed over during my blues years in high school, few topped JJ Cale. If he hadn&#39;t sang some of the songs I loved, he wrote them for Slowhand, or had inspired other acts like Mark Knopfler. His smooth blues mixed with rock and jazz were really something special.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-27/j-j-cale-writer-of-after-midnight-dies-at-age-74.html" title="J.J. Cale, Writer of ‘After Midnight,’ Dies at Age 74">Mark Beech in Bloomberg</a> has the nicest summary I&#39;ve seen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He was a guitar player who avoided show &#8212; the underrated guitarists&#39; underrated guitarist &#8212; and yet crafted economical, outstanding rock solos, especially when dueling with his friend Clapton. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, I wanted to pay tribute to him in my own nerdy way. For this, I turn to my younger self, and the cover of his song I used to sing down the hallways in early high school.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you ready? Because, if you want to hang out, you gotta take her out;<br />
<strong>Coffee.</strong><br />
If you want to get down, brewing the grounds;<br />
<strong>Coffee.</strong><br />
She don&#39;t lie, she don&#39;t lie, she don&#39;t lie&#8230;<br />
<strong>Coffee.</strong></p>
<p>If you got bad news, you want to roast them blues;<br />
<strong>Coffee.</strong><br />
When your day is done, and you got to run<br />
<strong>Coffee.</strong><br />
She don&#39;t lie, she don&#39;t lie, she don&#39;t lie&#8230;<br />
<strong>Coffee.</strong></p>
<p>If your thing is gone, and you want to ride on;<br />
<strong>Coffee.</strong><br />
Don&#39;t forget this fact, you can&#39;t brew it back;<br />
<strong>Coffee.</strong><br />
She don&#39;t lie, she don&#39;t lie, she don&#39;t lie&#8230;<br />
<strong>Coffee.</strong></p>
