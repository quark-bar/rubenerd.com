<p>In 2009, my beloved Stephen Fry and Christopher Hitchens debated that the Catholic Church was not a force for good in the world. In this part of his opening statements, Steven discusses Pope Benedict XVI.</p>
<p>I hope this <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1737258/Questions-on-Popes-lingering-influence">retiring Pope</a> is proud of his legacy.</p>
