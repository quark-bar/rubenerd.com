<p>While I sit here <a href="http://rubenerd.com/directx90c-windows2000/" title="RubÃ©nerd: Windows 2000 only supports up to Feb 2010 DirectX 9.0c">lamenting software versioning</a>, Clara has gone ahead and <a href="http://kirinyan.net/cooking-with-nyan-hard-toffee/" title="Kirinyan: Cooking with Nyan - Hard Toffee">written a post about hard toffee</a>. I&#39;m sorry, that joke wasn&#39;t terribly sweet.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always been more of a fudge kind of guy, or at least for as long as I attempted to make toffee as a teenager, and created fudge by accident. It&#39;s the same way I accidently made scones when I tried to bake bread. In any event, Clara&#39;s latest effort has allowed me to see the error in my ways; there is lots to love about toffee!</p>
<p>Clara has lots of interesting tidbits sprinked into her post, including her use of silcon cups to prevent those nasty strips of paper sticking to your culinary creations. If you&#39;re interested in sweetness, check it out.</p>
<p>And before you ask, this was not a paid promotional post. Unless you count free samples as payment ;).</p>
