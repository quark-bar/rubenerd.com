<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/comment/letting-go-of-the-us-20130825-2sjoa.html">Former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser</a>, on the use of Australian intelligence to support the American drone programme:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.smh.com.au/comment/letting-go-of-the-us-20130825-2sjoa.html">
<p>President Barack Obama says he respects the sovereignty of other states, but quite blatantly his drone program does not. We are complicit in it. Under what law does this operate? We have signed on to the International Criminal Court; are we culpable under that?</p>
<p>Australia should be telling the US: &#8220;We do not like these operations, we do not wish to be complicit in them. You had better establish alternative processes that do not touch Australia. You cannot use information collected at Pine Gap to support drone targeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Itâ€™s really wonderful to see these former political leaders in Australia and the United States asking these tough, necessary questions. Where in the heck are the incumbents (and current opposition) though?</p>
