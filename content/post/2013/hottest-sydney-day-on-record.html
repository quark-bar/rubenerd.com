<p>I’m writing this post as I sit here at the <a href="http://www.canterbury.nsw.gov.au/www/default.asp?guiValue=845BE1BE-D4A9-4AF4-8015-E72FD9E0C557">Earlwood Library</a>, basking in its crisp air conditioning and drinking litres of chilled water from my fridge down the road. Earlier today, I was typing code and prose at the <a href="http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/euro-coffee-bar-earlwood">Euro Coffee Bar</a> and chatting with the owner about the new air curtains he had installed to keep the aircon inside.</p>
<p>According to ADN and the Twitterari, Sydney had its hottest day since records were begun 157 years ago. Having blogged about the <a href="//rubenerd.com/hot-damn-sydney/">temperature reaching 41°</a> earlier in the month, today it got past 47°C (about 117°F). I compared walking outside on that day to being hit in the face by a hair dryer. Today, it was more akin to stepping into a tandoori oven, and without the benefit of getting food afterwards. What an insult.</p>
<p>I’m lucky I didn’t have to catch a train. Predictably, <a href="//rubenerd.com/files/20130118.screenie.heatwave.png">CityRail is in chaos (screenshot)</a>, with all but two lines reporting delays and skipped stations, including mine.</p>
<p>I’m super lucky to have been able to enjoy air conditioning all day today. Plenty of people weren’t so lucky.</p>
