<p>As I <a href="http://ruben.smallpict.com/2013/07/04/recreatingMyPrimaryBlog">eluded to in a previous post</a>, I’m in the process of moving <a href="http://rubenerd.com/">my self-hosted WordPress blog</a> over to Jekyll. It has over 5,000+ posts written since 2004. It’s been a huge pain, but I’ve got all of them exported and in the Markdown format Jekyll expects. Now I’m just in the process of writing the Liquid themes and RSS feed templates.</p>
<p>And then I read Dave Winer’s posts about Fargo, and tried it out.</p>
<p>Now I find myself writing here, instead of continuing my old blog migration. After a brief session riddled with mistakes, I already find it effortless. It’s an outline, I have a dinousaur looking at me.</p>
<p>Jekyll and Fargo are simple, but couldn’t be more different. I’ll be interested to see how this battle between them plays out.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: I’m going to use (I hate the word &#8220;try&#8221;) this for posts on university assignments and work, and see how it goes. I have a month to get my Fargo blog looking spiffy before next semester starts! ☺ </p>
