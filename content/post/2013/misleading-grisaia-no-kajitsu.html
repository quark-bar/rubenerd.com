<p>I was all excited to see this new art of my beloved Senjougahara Hitagi, still the best character from the *monogratari franchise. If you believe otherwise, You Are Wrong.&trade; Well, Nadeko Sengoku is cute too.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was wrong, for a very different reason. This is someone (who?) from Grisaia no Kajitsu, a visual novel about an academy for socially awkward people. At least, as far as I can tell. It runs on the <a href="http://animeadvertisements.tumblr.com/">SOMY</a> PSP, some obscure portable gaming device thing that doesn’t run iOS or Android.</p>
<p>It’s understandable why they’d want to take visual cues from one of the greatest modern anime characters ever, but still.</p>
