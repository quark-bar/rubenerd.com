<p>Everyone I’ve spoken to or read has said <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/11227/Rinne_no_Lagrange">Rinne no Lagrange</a> was underwhelming. As a science fiction fan though, I’m fascinated by these flying mecha contraptions. What are they? How do they work? Their designs almost have a 1980s anime quality to them, at least from the screencaps and art of them I’ve seen.</p>
<p>If I ever find out, it’ll be a while from now. The Ruben Kyoto Animation Law is still in full effect, meaning I have to watch the rest of Hyouka, Chuunibyou and start Tamako Market. I wish I had a choice in these matters, but I don’t, you see.</p>
