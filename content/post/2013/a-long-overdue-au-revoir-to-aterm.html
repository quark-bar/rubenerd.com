<p>Talk about being late to the party! Checking out the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rxvt-unicode">Wikipage page for my favourite terminal emulator</a>, I saw this:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rxvt-unicode"><p>
After aterm was merged into rxvt-unicode, it is now the preferred terminal emulator for the AfterStep window manager.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough,<br />
<a href="http://www.afterstep.org/news.php?show=2008">on the Aterm site</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.afterstep.org/news.php?show=2008"><p>January 1, 2008 &#8211; aterm 1.0.1 merged into urxvt!</p>
<p>aterm development will now concentrate on urxvt, so aterm is now deprecated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why was I not informed!?</p>
<p>Aside from having a name I found rather clever and silly, aterm will always hold a special place in my memories. While looking for RAM saving alternatives to Xterm and desktop environment terminal emulator, aterm still managed to do some pretty nifty pseud-composting. With a trivial amount of effort, aterm could be made really, really pretty. I mean, Terminal.app level of pretty.</p>
<p>Eventually I moved to mrxvt for the convenience of tabs, then to urxvt when I really did need Unicode support. Almost tempted to install aterm in Homebrew just to see if my config files from yesteryear still work (^_^).</p>
