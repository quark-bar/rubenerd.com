<p>Yesterday, I mentioned that OS X 10.9 Mavericks <a href="http://localhost:4000/mavericks-would-be-great-if-it-liked-my-keyboard/" title="RubÃ©nerd: Mavericks would be great, if it liked my keyboard">wasn&#39;t remembering the key mappings</a> for my PC keyboard. Since then, I chanced upon a utility called <a href="https://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/">KeyRemap4MacBook</a>, dubbed <em>&quot;a powerful and stable keyboard customizer for OS X&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>Buried in its inexplicable option list, I was able to find Alt/Command and Windows/Option remappings, as well as a few other tricks. Best of all, it remembers the mappings after a system restart, and when the keyboard is removed and plugged in again.</p>
<p>It still feels weird using a third party utility to compensate for a feature that&#39;s supposed to work in the base system, but for now it&#39;s a solution and I&#39;ll take it. Thank you <a href="https://pqrs.org/profile.html.en">Takayama Fumihiko</a> for saving me much frustration!</p>
