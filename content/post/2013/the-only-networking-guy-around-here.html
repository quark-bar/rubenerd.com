<p>This is the third in my *fabulous* networking meme series, <a href="http://memegenerator.net/instance/37805852">generated here</a>. The <a href="//rubenerd.com/i-dont-always-make-lame-networking-memes/">first one was here</a>, and the <a href="//rubenerd.com/one-does-not-simply-network-meme/">second one was here</a>. You’re welcome. You’re welcome.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what it is about this one that makes my sides split… he just seems so… furious!</p>
