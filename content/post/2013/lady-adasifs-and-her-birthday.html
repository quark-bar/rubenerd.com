<p>Earlier this week, one of the most upstanding members of the <a href="http://utsanime.net/">Anime@UTS club</a> had her birthday. She’s made a habit of doing this every year.</p>
<p>As someone who recently experienced that surge of pain at the prospects of becoming older than one preferred to be, I could relate to her hesitation to celebrate. We’d all planned to do something for her anyway, but always the illustrious <em>Event Organiser&trade;</em> she figured out several fun activities during the day, including a high tea and a piping-hot <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/rph/70/751501/72122/sydney-milliore-korean-fusion-restaurant-milliore-korean-fusion-restaurant-photo">gastronomically delectable Korean dinner</a>.</p>

She’d scoff at such a notion, but the turnout was just a testament to all the people who think she’s a great friend. So there!</p>
