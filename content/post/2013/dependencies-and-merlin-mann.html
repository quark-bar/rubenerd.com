<p>Merlin Mann’s <em><a title="OmniFocus - Video - The Omni Group"  href="https://www.omnigroup.com/video/omnifocus#say-it-dont-spray-it-specific-tasks-for-specific-outcomes">Say it don’t spray it</a></em> productivity talk on the OmniFocus site was a keeper. The following was the most salient part for me, other than blackberry jam. <em>Hi; is your jam not berry enough? Hi.</em> Wait, that wasn’t it.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd"><p>Every time you realise a dependency, you get closer to what you need to do.</p>

<p>You don’t need to be a <a title="About GTD | David Allen, Getting Things Done® and GTD®" href="http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd">GTD</a> (® David Allen Company 2001) or <a title="OmniFocus - The Omni Group" href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> nerd to appreciate that all projects have dependencies, and identifying those dependencies is the first step to get out of a procrastination spiral. Is that the term? <em>Hi; is there compost in your crisper? Vegetables lacking crispness? Hi</em>. I can’t say how many times I’ve been stuck on how to proceed on a task, only to realise its because there’s a dumb (and relatively simple) thing I need to do <strong>first</strong> to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, I have an assignment due on Friday. Is there something meta about watching a video about productivity, rather than doing that? Big week.</p>
<p>I’m also just an unabashed fan of Merlin Mann, though you probably long since figured that out.</p>
