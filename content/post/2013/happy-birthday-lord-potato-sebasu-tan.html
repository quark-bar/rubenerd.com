<p>When <a href="http://alonelyseptember.org/">Seb</a> invited us to a games afternoon and Korean BBQ yesterday to celebrate his birthday, we were too cheap to buy him a bigger keeki. We kid of course (or do we?)! Cindy bought an epic cake, we all had a wonderful time and Seb cut it with the imitable style, grace and sophistication we’ve come to expect from <em>The Lord of The Potatoes</em>.</p>
<p>Happy belated Birthday Seb, may your appealing reign continue to be grounded in win. After all, you’re no commentator :).</p>
