<p>I suspected my <a title="The Fifth Estate Assange Wikileaks movie" href="//rubenerd.com/the-fifth-estate-assange-wikileaks-movie/">Fifth Estate</a> post would generate some feedback, and it did!</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/wonk_01/status/294290580215844866">@wonk_01</a>: It’s a dangerous new step for them into the military-entertainment-complex, imho.</p>

<p>Agreed.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/TypeDom/status/294288791517138944">@TypeDom</a>: Regardless of everything political or propagandistic about it, Benedict Cumberbatch looks creepy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was a devilishly attractive Sherlock, but being done up in a creepy fashion is in itself propaganda.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/babylove0306/status/294354330457350144">@babylove0306</a>: you [sic] are ridiculous. Judging a movie before it’s even filmed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s the <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/entertainment/view/1249867/1/.html">great thing about scripts</a>. I’m relieved I’m ridiculous though, my greatest fear in life is mediocrity. Well, that and <a href="http://australianmuseum.net.au/Funnel-web-Spiders-group/">funnel web spiders</a>.</p>
