<p>Perhaps its a remnant of my dial-up days, but Iâ€™m one of those old fashioned people that keeps local copies of all the stuff I download. Saves me having to download them again if I need to reinstall.</p>
<p>In the case of Xcode 4.x, components are downloaded and installed from the Preferences screen, but you can still keep the downloaded disk images by navigating to:</p>
<pre>~/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.Xcode/Downloads/</pre>
<p>Ironically enough, I only remembered this again when I was going through my home folder backups, and realised my Caches folder was way larger than it should be.</p>
