<p>Many years ago, I remember attempting to install VMware Workstation on a Virtual PC (remember that?) virtual machine on Mac OS 8 my iMac. The experiment ultimately failed, but was ridiculously fun nonetheless. Fast foward to 2013, and our class was tasked with performing a far more advanced, though similar activity!</p>
<p>With the use of some pre-built images, I had:</p>
<ul>
<li>A CentOS 6.4 VM, running on a VMware ESXi VM, running in VMware Fusion on my MacBook Air.</li>
<li>The CentOS VM had been provisioned through a VMware vSphere client, running on a seperate Windows XP VM, running in VMware Fusion, and was communicating with the ESXi VM through a shared subnet.</li>
</ul>
<p>In lieu of using dedicated hardware in class to run ESXi and demonstrate how to rapidly provision VMs using share data pools, this approach allowed us to still get a taste of level 1 virtualisation. It also gave us a chance to make some <em>Xibit Inception Meta</em> jokes about running a VM in a VM provisioned through a VM</p>
<p>Once again at UTS, we were fortunate enough to have Sheng Yeo show us the ropes. Last semester, Sheng gave a talk about Infrastructure as a Service, and how he and his fellow UTS alumni had built <a href="http://orionvm.com/">OrionVM</a>, the world’s fastest cloud. Virtualisation has continued to be an area I’m interested in, and I was thankful to have someone who’s worked in the trenches offer his pragmatic, real world experience.</p>
<p>In particular, while I have experience with virtualisation in industrial process control, VPSs and running multipe OSs on my own client machines, discussion into large scale deployment has given me much valuable insight. There’s a tremendous amount of fascinating work being done in this field, and some equally large challenges.</p>
<p>Thanks again to Sheng and the University of Technology, Sydney for a productive and fun evening!</p>
