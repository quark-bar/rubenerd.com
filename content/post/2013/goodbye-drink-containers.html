<p>So we’re moving house again, and it’s a lot of work. My first task, cleaning out and throwing away more of my stuff.</p>
<p>I’m certainly not at the level of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsive_hoarding">hoarder</a>, but I’m a &quot;collector&quot;. Coins, stamps, computer cables, business cards… and for some reason thoroughly-washed beverage containers. Most of them have a history that are either far too personal or embarrassing to impart here! XD</p>
<p>As with my old display, I find taking pictures of things renders them easier to dispose of. Perhaps immortalising them on my <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/">Flickr feed</a> means they’re still with me somehow. I’m a weird person.</p>
<p>From top left to bottom right, immortalised forever here on Rub&#233;nerd.com:</p>
