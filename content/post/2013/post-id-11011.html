<p>Don’t look now, but WordPress has assigned the ID for this post as #11011. That’s a binary number we’d express as 27 in base &#8220;10&#8221;, which ironically could also be expressed as a binary, but base &#8220;2&#8221; couldn’t be. When I finally make the move to Octopress, that’ll render everything as base 8, right?</p>
<p>I haven’t done a <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">pointless milestone</a> in a long time, it felt good!</p>
