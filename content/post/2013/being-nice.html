<p>During a classic South Park episode, Cartman dresses smartly to impress Kyle. When Kyle retorts <em>&quot;that&#39;s not being nice, that&#39;s just putting on a nice sweater&quot;</em> Cartman replies that he doesn&#39;t know the difference. <em>&quot;I know you don&#39;t&quot;</em>, Kyle says.</p>
<p>We can claim whatever we like about ourselves. We can claim to be fantastic bloggers, or inventive, or impartial. Our peers judge the validity of our assertions by assessing our actions. <em>&quot;Ruben claimed he&#39;s a fantastic blogger, but Rubenerd.com is absolutely terrible!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Make false claims about yourself repeatedly, and you lose credibility.</p>
<p>Niceness is one such judgeable (judgeable?) trait. It doesn&#39;t matter if your social network profile has a unicode peace sign, or if you append every sentence with a smilie. If enough people feel slighted or burned by your remarks, you&#39;ll develop a reputation contrary to what you claim about yourself.</p>

&quot;Just got off the phone with some fanboy. What a tool! :-)&quot;</p>

<p>Fortunately, there&#39;s good news. If you&#39;re nice, people in your circle won&#39;t need you to tell them.</p>
