<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> and I decided to make productive use of our Northern Line commuting time by watching <a href="//rubenerd.com/anime/">anime</a>! We’ve been watching a ton of stuff from this season, as well as catching up and finishing some old favourites like <em>Chuunibyou</em>. I ended up enjoying that series way more than I thought I would, but that’s the subject for another post.</p>
<p>Now that we’re watching <em>Hyouka</em> again, Clara surprised me a couple of days ago with another of her adorable original artworks, this time of the legendary curious Chitanda! Naturally, she says it’s no good. I think you’d agree with me she’s full of absolute nonsense!</p>
<p>I don’t have any Chitanda figs [yet], so I surrounded her with Yuki, another character I see Clara in when I watch anime. I think it’s fitting d(^_^)b.</p>
