<p>I’m somewhere and there’s got to be more out there, that’s so great for books, that’s so great for the internet, and that’s kind of what bums me out about we don’t do stuff in space any more. It seems like there’s so much more we could be doing to be curious, you know? And when we stop being institutionally curious, we die a little.</p>
