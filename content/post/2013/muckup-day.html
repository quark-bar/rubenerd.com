<p>Clara and I have both been far too busy with assignments to blog anything of substance lately in the last week, but <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/wild-muckup-days-a-thing-of-the-past-principals-say-20130916-2tuzb.html#">this article by Josephine Tovey</a> in today’s Sydney Morning Herald brought such a smile to my face I had to share it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Muck-up day has long been associated with flour bombs on the teachers’ cars or chucking water bombs and shaving cream at unsuspecting junior peers. [..]</p>
<p>Today’s school leavers are more likely to be taking part in a charity fun run, dressing up for an assembly or playing a sports match against their teachers in their final days of year 12.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some may cynically attribute this to my generation being too passive, or in bed with the establishment. Predictably, I think it’s just further proof we’re not the rude, disrespectful, self-absorbed pricks the Boomers and Gen X say we are.</p>
<p>And even if we were, who’s parenting fault would that be? ;).</p>
