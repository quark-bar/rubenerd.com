<p>Everyone is scrambling to understand why the <em>Fairy Tail</em> anime adaptation is ending. Much of the speculation and conjecture, predictably, surrounds Hirano Aya and her alleged activities.</p>
<p>Frankly, there’s enough mudslinging going on, and I don’t feel compelled one iota to be a part of it. The shit she’s had to endure from otaku over the years is&#8230; I can’t find the words.</p>
<p>What I will say is with the end of the series, we say goodbye to her in her last role. I haven’t watched any full episodes of Fairy Tail, but the clips I’ve seen of her as Lucy Heartfilia were great; no question she’s a talented seiyuu. Whether she’ll come back and act again is an open question; as a fan of her work, I hope she does.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to 2006. I was living in Malaysia at the time, and the world had begun to obsess over the <em>Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu</em> universe. After seeing posters of her everywhere in the predominately Chinese-Malaysian sections of KL, I was intrigued enough to check the series out. Like everyone else, I’d watched <em>Sailor Moon</em>, <em>DragonBallZ</em> and <em>Pokémon</em> growing up, but this was the series that got me into the world of anime culture and regular series watching.</p>
<p>As someone who grew up voice acting (albeit for the Discovery Channel, but never mind!), I have a real appreciation for the art. Haruhi wasn’t my favourite character, but Aya Hirano brought her to life brilliantly, as she has done for countless other characters since.</p>
<p>I wish her all the best in her health and future work.</p>
