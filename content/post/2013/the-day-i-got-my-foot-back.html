<p>At the risk of sounding melodramatic, I did something today that I’ve been wanting to do for two months. Something I got pretty good at doing since I was a kid. You ready for it? No, really, are you ready for it?</p>
<p>For the first time since I <a title="Wednesday 19 June 2013: I broke ground on Sunday, with my ankle!<br />
" href="//rubenerd.com/i-broke-ground-on-sunday-with-my-ankle/">fell through a utility cover</a> and tore a bunch of ligaments that I’d become rather attached to, today I eschewed (gesundheit) my paediatric cam boot in favour of a regular shoe.</p>
<p>In case you didn’t catch that, I put on a f*cking shoe!</p>
<p>Two months ago, I could barely put a sock on the swollen, purple mess of bruised flesh and bones that I’d previously (and affectionately) referred to as my right foot. I won’t beat around the bush, it was the most excruciating pain I’ve ever experienced; even more so than when I broke it the first time when I was 14.</p>
<p>Today, I was able to put a compression sock on it, then a shoe, and walk out the door. The liberating feel of independence was indescribable; so much so that I’m willing to forgive myself for writing this appalling sentence.</p>
<p>My lateral and inversion motions still have yet to fully return, so I’ll still be ungainly hobbling along the street for at least another month. My podiatrist and physiotherapist both said I injured it severely enough that it will only ever probably be 80-85% as strong as it was before.</p>
<p>Still, I’m taking this as a huge victory ^_^. Thank you to everyone (you know who you are) for your support and well wishes during this whole ordeal. Also, a humbled, extra huge thank you to <a rel="friend met muse crush date sweetheart" href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> for basicically giving up her holidays to stay at home with her boyfriend who couldn’t move. I’m such a lucky guy.</p>
<p>As for the photo above, I tried to take the same photo in the same position and the same lame GIMP (get it?) effect I <a title="Wednesday 19 June 2013: I broke ground on Sunday, with my ankle!<br />
" href="//rubenerd.com/i-broke-ground-on-sunday-with-my-ankle/">took for my last post</a>. Not sure it really worked, but I was excited to try!</p>
