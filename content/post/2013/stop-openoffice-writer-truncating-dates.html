<p>When you’re have a report due, the last thing you want OpenOffice Writer doing is maddeningly truncating your dates in tables like it’s 1999. Fortunately, after a cup of tea I realised table cells in Writer behave the same way as spreadsheet cells in Calc. By which I mean, the documentation said so.</p>
<p>To fix:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the offending 02/09/13 cell</li>
<li>Choose &#8220;Number format…&#8221; from the Table menu</li>
<li>Choose &#8220;31/12/1999&#8243; from the Format listbox</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m assuming this would work for LibreOffice too.</p>
