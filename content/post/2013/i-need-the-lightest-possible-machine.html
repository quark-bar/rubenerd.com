<p>Me, <a title="Tuesday 10th January 2012: Intel Ultrabooks at CES, via @kevinctofel" href="//rubenerd.com/intel-ultrabooks/">exactly one year ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>For me, an ultrabook would fill the niche between my souped up desktop at home, and my smartphone. As a &#8220;power user&#8221; and developer with very specialised software requirements, I need the lightest possible machine with decent battery life, a full sized keyboard and the ability to run desktop applications. My back can’t take carrying a 15 inch MacBook Pro any more. iPads and Kindle Fires can’t fill that roll, nor are they intended to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was commenting about Intel Ultrabooks, but I’m now a proud owner of a MacBook Air, so it’s all good. To use some of Apple’s language, it’s wondrous how all my above requirements were satisfied with it.</p>
<p>It also occurred to me that I used &#8220;roll&#8221; in place of &#8220;role&#8221;, again. Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve used the words &#8220;dishwasher&#8221; and &#8220;washing machine&#8221;, &#8220;elbow&#8221; and &#8220;shoulder&#8221;, and &#8220;roll&#8221; and &#8220;role&#8221; interchangeably, even though I know better. Old habits dye hard.</p>
