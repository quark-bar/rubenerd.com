<p>With the latest series of <em>Pokémon</em> games, I’ve been seeing the word &#8220;Ditto&#8221; being thrown around. Naturally, they must be referring to the device pictured above.</p>
<p>The Iomega Ditto was a personal tape backup storage drive from the same mob who developed the Zip drive, and the Bernoulli box before then. I remember seeing information about the Ditto on a demo CD that came with my other Iomega drives, and I was nerdy enough to still have a copy of it around to run in a VM.</p>
<p>I liked how it also came in a colour other than beige, even before the first iMac. The Jaz was green and the Zip was blue. The Bernoulli box was… beige. But still!</p>
<p>What blew my child mind however was the capacity of the tape cartridges. They were talking about <strong>gigabytes</strong> of storage in the late 1990s. Of course, I didn’t understand sequential versus random access, and that I wouldn’t be using it for day-to-day data. Still, I thought to myself I’d upgrade my Zip drive to a Jaz drive when I was older, and that I’d know I’d have grown up when I could afford to get a Ditto drive to store my amassed data on.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I was a very nerdy kid. Did I mention that?</p>
<p>As an addendum, I consider Red and Blue to be the only real <em>Pokémom</em> games. The rest are just like the last few Harry Potter books. Read into that how you wish.</p>
<p>Wonder if I could snag a Ditto drive on eBay? Because I don’t already have enough childhood nostalgic junk. Did I say junk? I meant…</p>
