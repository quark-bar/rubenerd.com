<p>After three months of <a title="Rubénerd: Lessons from Jekyll and Github pages" href="//rubenerd.com.com/lessons-from-github-pages/">hosting my site on GitHub pages</a>, last week I updated my DNS records and rsync’d my site back to my <a title="NetLogistics" href="http://www.netlogistics.com.au/">webhost</a> here in Sydney.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a decision I made lightly (or nginx, as it were). For what it does, and despite it’s horribly creepy logo, GitHub Pages is a decent service. Prior to using them, I was an hg and subversion guy with a WordPress site; now I’m also a git guy who’s migrated his site to <a title="Jekyll is a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby" href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and generates static pages like nobody’s business. I’m eternally grateful for both of these things.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, GitHub Pages and I didn’t end up jiving. I missed some of the fine grain control and sense of security that comes from hosting my own stuff. Perhaps as a result of my ridiculous number of posts, commits would often take hours to be reflected in the generated site (if at all), and my RSS feeds were often outdated.</p>
<p>It was a fun experiment, but as I’ve repeatedly learned over the years when using other services, I always come back to self hosting. For my needs, it’s just a better fit.</p>
