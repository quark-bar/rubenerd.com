<p><a href="http://rubenerd.com/oh-my-that-free_anime-series/">Speaking of free</a>, I was rather excited by this news this afternoon.</p>
<p>In an attempt to render Windows 8.1 more palatable to end users, Microsoft Advertising have announced they’re including advertisements in the new global <em>Smart Search</em> system built into the operating system.</p>
<p><a href="http://community.advertising.microsoft.com/msa/en/global/b/blog/archive/2013/07/02/new-search-ad-experience-windows-8-1.aspx">From the press release</a>, which was refreshingly devoid of marketing speak:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bing Ads will be an integral part of the new Windows 8.1 Smart Search experience. Now, with a single campaign setup, advertisers can connect with consumers across Bing, Yahoo! and the new Windows Search with highly relevant ads for their search queries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>User surveys have consistently shown people like being shown ads in products they’ve paid for, or when those results are informed by previous desktop searches. It’s why <a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2012/09/ubuntu-bakes-amazon-search-results-into-os-to-raise-cash/">Ubuntu includes Amazon referrals in their search results</a>, and why Mac OS X presents <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sarcasm">highly relevant banner ads in Spotlight</a>.</p>
<p>I think Microsoft have another hit here.</p>
