<p>I&#39;ve said for years that <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/jerrynovak" title="Jerry Novak">@JerryNovak</a> is the <em>de facto</em> patron of the Rubénerd Universe. Of all the people who&#39;ve <a href="/buy-coffee/">bought me coffee</a>, donated further amounts and&mdash;above all&mdash;offered kind words during times of need, there&#39;s no doubt ♔ Sir Novak has been the most generous.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/jerrynovak/status/414477686371676161" title="Link to Jerry&#39;s tweet">♔ Sir Novak tweeted this to me</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just sent @Rubenerd a Christmas gift from his Amazon wish list. It didn&#39;t give me gift options, though.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m humbled beyond belief, and more than a little curious about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/5QRTY3DN39AC/" title="My Amazon wish list">what said gift is</a>! No doubt when it arrives, I&#39;ll be posting all about it here.</p>
<p>Given his generosity and kindness over the years, I&#39;ve decided to bestow him with the title of <em>Rubénerd Patron ♔ Sir Novak</em>, effective immediately. Yes, that includes the unicode crown, thank you very much!</p>
<p>If I offered peerages for the Rubénerd Universe, he&#39;d be <em>♔ Earl Novak of Rubénerd America</em> or something to that effect. Between this and figuring out how best to showcase our official patron on the site, I&#39;ll have a lot to think about over the coming days. Thank you again ♔ Sir Novak :).</p>
