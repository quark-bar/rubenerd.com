<p>Peter Payne’s <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/jlist/statuses/384495878813523968">tweet</a> this morning reminded me of this site. I can remember a few years back when all the cool people had Quora accounts; needless to say I was not one of them.
<p>Expertsexchange <a href="https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/18527">traded answers found through search engines</a> for money. Quora trades them for privacy and a little sanity. Yes there are workarounds, but the best thing we can do is just let them disappear entirely.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">StackExchange</a> network has their own problems, but at least they’ve rescued us from the necessity of sites such as this.</p>
