<p>An hour ago, my sister tweeted that my wrist was on Gizmodo Australia. Sure enough, there I was on <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2013/02/how-stupid-are-you-willing-to-look-for-apples-magical-iwatch/">How Stupid Are You Willing To Look For Apple’s Magical iWatch?</a></p>
<p>My response (pending moderation):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>I’m the guy in the photo</strong> who’s <em>&#8220;Willing To Look Stupid For Apple&#8221;</em>. My sister tweeted me and said my wrist was on Gizmodo Australia.</p>
<p>For me, this generation iPod nano is really useful. I use the built in pedometer constantly (a feature that’s barely mentioned in the press). It’s a memory key I’m guaranteed to always have around, more so than other keys that so often get left in the wrong trouser pocket. As a watch, it’s easy to see at a glance. The wristband for it came from an official Apple Store. In a pinch, I can dump some podcasts onto it if my phone is running low on space.</p>
<p>And now I go back to ignoring Gawker sites and their regional clones with their sensationalist, click-bait headlines. <em>&#8220;How Stupid Are You Willing To Look For Apple’s Magical iWatch?&#8221;</em> … good grief.</p>
<p>It’s a shame nobody has a stolen prototype iWatch for your American colleagues to buy.</p>

<p>Stay classy, Gizmodo. Reach for new standards in journalistic excellence and integrity, while insulting the people you sourced your free image from.</p>
