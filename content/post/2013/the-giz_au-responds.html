<p><a class="transparent" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/8475448754/" title="When Gizmodo Australia said I looked stupid by rubenerd, on Flickr"><img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8086/8475448754_2fdc5475e1.jpg" width="500" height="335" alt="When Gizmodo Australia said I looked stupid" /></a></p>
<p>While checking some replies to my <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Rubenerd_blog">Rubenerd_blog</a> account, I noticed I got some feedback from Gizmodo Australia for their <a href="//rubenerd.com/gizmodo-australia-said-i-looked-stupid/">inflammatory blog post</a> that included a photo of me under the headline saying I’m willing to look stupid.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://mobile.twitter.com/lukehopewell/status/304794875856031744"><p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/lukehopewell/status/304794875856031744">@Giz_au</a>: Hey mate. I haven’t deleted your comment. If we had, we’d see it there as deleted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m interested how people saw my comment, but then it disappeared.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/lukehopewell/status/304794936161734656">@Giz_au</a>: Second, your image is CCBYSA2.0 and if you don’t want it used you should change that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, and if you want to use share-alike images, you need to change Gizmodo Australia to use that same (or equivalent) licence. Otherwise, <em>&#8220;you should change that&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>But that’s beside the point. My objection was the tasteless, inflammatory article itself. Arguing over a technicality (which you even got wrong) when the issue is calling someone stupid is even less classy.</p>

<p>You shot who in the what now?</p>
<blockquote cite="https://mobile.twitter.com/lukehopewell/status/304795054583713792"><p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/lukehopewell/status/304795054583713792">@Giz_au</a> We don’t think you’re stupid at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could have fooled us with that headline.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m done with this and moving on. It’s my fault for expecting more from Gizmodo.</p>
