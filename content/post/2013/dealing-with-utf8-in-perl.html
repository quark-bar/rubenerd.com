<p>If you have Perl warnings enabled (like a good developer), chances are you’ve seen something like this when executing your script:</p>
<pre class="code" style="overflow-x:scroll;">
Wide character in print at ./[file].pl line [x].
</pre>
<p>As with everything in Perl, there are Many Ways&trade; to deal with this.</p>
<p>The first is to include the following line along with your regular Perl boilerplate. I always write my scripts and text files in UTF8, so this merely enforces UTF8 output.</p>
<pre class="code" style="overflow-x:scroll;">
binmode(STDOUT, ":utf8");
</pre>
<p>This will deal with those warnings, and let you get on with your work.</p>
<p>An alternative is to enforce UTF8 for STDIN and STDERR, as well as STDOUT with this line.</p>
<pre class="code" style="overflow-x:scroll;">
use open qw/:std :utf8/;
</pre>
<p>And of course, there’s always a trusty environment variable.</p>
<pre class="code" style="overflow-x:scroll;">
export PERL_UNICODE=SDL
</pre>
