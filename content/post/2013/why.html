<p>Inevitably, when I ask how do something on a technical support site, I get unhelpful people replying with <em>&#8220;why?&#8221;</em>. If I blog a potential solution to a niche problem, I get people asking <em>&#8220;but why would you want to?&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>On the one hand, they’re perfectly valid responses for those lacking a certain degree of empathy. If you’ve never had to do something, or solve a very specific problem, why would this Ruben person have to? On the other hand, you have different fingers.</p>
<p>Rather than expending further energy justifying problem solving, rather than the problem solving itself, I’ve created this post to refer people to henceforth.</p>
<p>If you find yourself linked to this page, may you find your answer. Cheers!</p>
