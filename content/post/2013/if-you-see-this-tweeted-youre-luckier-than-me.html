<p>A crazy evening with The Internet tonight. I can access most sites just fine, but the following just refuse to load. It’s almost as if a local CDN mirror is down.</p>
<ul>
<li>Twitter.com and all my Twitter clients</li>
<li>Optus.com.au</li>
<li>Optuszoo.com</li>
<li>Apple iMessages</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m just lucky I have <a href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> to act as a liaison officer for me! She’s pretty much relaying all my university group messages this evening.</p>
