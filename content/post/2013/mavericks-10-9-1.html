<p>The first dot release update for OS X 10.9 Mavericks is now available for everyone, meaning I now consider the OS safe for production use in my book. If my iBook G3 could run Mavericks, that is.</p>
<p>As an alternative to the App Store, Apple provides redistributables (is that a word?) for the update:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1715">OS X Mavericks 10.9.1 Update</a></li>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1707">OS X Mavericks 10.9.1 Update for Mac Pro</a></li>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1712">OS X Mavericks 10.9.1 Update for MacBook Pro with Retina Display (Late 2013)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I still think its a good idea to download updates like this manually, particularly if you have multiple machines in the same house and are burdened with Australian ADSL instead of your Singaporean internet connection from back home. I call it technical homesickness, or <strong>tomesickness</strong> for short. It can also help bring a new machine up to speed quickly if you have to reinstall the base OS at some point.</p>
