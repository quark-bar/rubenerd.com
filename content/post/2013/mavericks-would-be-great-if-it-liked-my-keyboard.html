<p>I promised myself I would never run a GM or .0 release of software again, but despite all my previous experience and logic centre pleading for sanity, I upgraded my production machine to Mavericks on Tuesday. All seems to be great, with the exception of my PC keyboard.</p>
<h3>In a nutshell, there&#39;s usually a nut</h3>
<p>I&#39;ll spare you lots of what you&#39;re already read before. The new Finder tabs are wonderful and long overdue. Skeuomorphism didn&#39;t bother me, but the new app designs are classy, even if still a little visually inconsistent with the standard system. The new Dock design is pretty, as too is the redesigned System Preferences which maintains its usability advantage over the post-XP Windows Control Panel. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll ever get into Finder Tags, but we&#39;ll see.</p>
<p>Under the hood, we have the 2.x and 5.16.x streams of Ruby and Perl respectfully, which really brings OS X into 2013. Unfortunately, we&#39;re still stuck with ancient versions of tcsh and rsync; I guess its back to building from source and <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes" title="System duplicate formulae for the Homebrew package manager">tapping homebrew/dupes</a> again.</p>
<p>Overall, it feels like a solid release. There&#39;s just one problem.</p>
<h3>Why art thou scared of PC keyboards?</h3>
<p>Since 2009, I&#39;ve been the proud user of a <a href="//rubenerd.com/my-unicomp-keyboard/" title="I love my new Unicomp buckling spring keyboard!">Unicomp SpaceSaver</a>, a buckling spring keyboard made from the same machines that manufactured the legendary IBM Model M. As is to be expected, its a 104 key PC layout, though I&#39;ve since modified the Windows and Alt keys to be Option and Command respectfully.</p>
<p>My wording there was very deliberate. PC keyboards lay out their keys as <em>Control Windows Alt</em>. On the Mac, its <em>Control Option Command</em>. If you use a PC keyboard, this can be corrected by going to Keyboard in System Preferences, and swapping the Option and Command modifier keys. I <a href="//rubenerd.com/unicomp-mac-keycaps/" title="RubÃ©nerd: Mac keycaps for Unicomp keyboards">blogged about this procedure in 2009</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mavericks doesn&#39;t store these settings persistently. If I unplug my MacBook Air, then return later, I have to reconfigure the keyboard. Worse still, sometimes the machine will just revert the layout back, leaving me with a trail of characters on my screen instead of the Command-Something shortcut I wanted.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a shame this bug has persisted into the GM. At present the other features are enough to keep me here, though if it gets too frustrating I might have to switch back to Mountain Lion.</p>
