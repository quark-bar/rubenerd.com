<p>Mac legend Brent Simmons writing <a href="http://inessential.com/2013/06/07/how_we_work_together">&#8220;How We Work Together&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://inessential.com/2013/06/07/how_we_work_together"><p>To swim with the current these days is to use git. But I like Mercurial better — and I think Mercurial is to Macintosh as git is to Windows. That’s probably not fair or rational, but it doesn’t really matter, since both git and Mercurial are excellent systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have similar sentiments. While I find Mercurial to be a far better fit personally, I made the switch to Git largely because most of my favourite projects now use it. Which is to say, they use Github.</p>
<p>I do have a couple of private hg repos on Bitbucket, but I’ll probably be making the switch to Git soon. A smarter person could juggle both systems, but I prefer just using the one. Heck I only just stopped using SVN for my personal projects last year, and <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/cvsup.html">CVS for my FreeBSD updates</a>.</p>
<p>Good heavens, remember CVS? I may prefer Mercurial, but wow Git is a lovely warm cup of tea compared to that!</p>

<p>A few people have informed me on Twitter that it’s spelled <em>&#8220;git&#8221;</em>, not <em>&#8220;Git&#8221;</em>. While technically true, it’s <em>&#8220;Yahoo!&#8221;</em> not <em>&#8220;Yahoo&#8221;</em> as well, but who spells it as such? I suppose including a whopping big logo with the correct spelling didn’t compensate for my use of capitalisation (^_~).</p>
