<p>Also me, <a title="Wednesday 11th January 2012: Google profits more from legitimate ads" href="//rubenerd.com/google-illegal-ads/">exactly one year ago</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Isn’t it interesting that the same people who blast Apple for their uphill battle screening software for the App Store are often the ones who rush to Google’s defence for not catching all fraudulent advertising? It’s not double standards though, because they don’t call it that, and because It’s Not Apple So It’s Okay™.</p>
