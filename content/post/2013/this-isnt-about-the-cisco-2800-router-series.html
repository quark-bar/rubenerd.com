<p>While searching for information on an End of Life Cisco router series, I <a href="http://www.assaabloy.com.au/en/local/au/News_and_Events/News_Archive/2012/Products/Lockwood-1800-2800-Series-Plate-Furniture-Turn-Upgrade/">unwittingly stumbled upon this</a>.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.assaabloy.com.au/en/local/au/News_and_Events/News_Archive/2012/Products/Lockwood-1800-2800-Series-Plate-Furniture-Turn-Upgrade/"><p>Today ASSA ABLOY Australia is pleased to announce yet another improvement to this range.
