<p>When I <a href="//rubenerd.com/unboxing-mba/">first got my MacBook Air</a>, naturally the first things I took care of were desktop backgrounds. I mean, these things wonâ€™t resolve themselves. Which is to say, <a href="http://www.switchingtomac.com/tutorials/how-to-rotate-wallpapers-in-osx/">they will</a>, but I wanted something more fitting for a machine that would be used for coding, writing posts such as these, and watching anime.</p>
<p>I opted for <a href="http://www.zerochan.net/552168">this image</a> of Nagato Yuki with Hatsune Miku for the main desktop, and on a whim an image of <a href="//rubenerd.com/files/2013/screenie.yuki.terminalback.png">Yuki in her trademark blue mizugi</a> as my Terminal.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to me, my lovely girlfriend Clara tirelessly tracked down a mini-fig of Yuki wearing that exact outfit, and gave it to me as a present yesterday! In an <strong>ocean</strong> of packing boxes, tape, paper and other nonsense from our move still littering our house, her attire seemed oddly fitting XD.</p>
