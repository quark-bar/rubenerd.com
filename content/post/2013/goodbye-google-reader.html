<p>Without any touch of irony, <a href="http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html">Google have announced</a> on their Official Google Reader blog that the service will be shutting down:</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<blockquote><p>We have just announced on the Official Google Blog that we will soon retire Google Reader (the actual date is July 1, 2013). We know Reader has a devoted following who will be very sad to see it go. We’re sad too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Uh huh.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are two simple reasons for this: usage of Google Reader has declined</p></blockquote>
<p>Because you actively made it less useful.</p>
<blockquote><p>and as a company we’re pouring all of our energy into fewer products. We think that kind of focus will make for a better user experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, you want us using Google+ instead. How many failed social networks does this make for Google now… seven?</p>
<h3>Google Reader was my Twitter</h3>
<p>In 2007 (or maybe 2006?) I <a href="//rubenerd.com/p3877/">made the shift from Bloglines to Google Reader</a>, largely because all my Whole Wheat Radio friends had done so already. The initial early-AJAX interface seemed more cumbersome than the relatively simple frame-based design of Bloglines, but I liked that I could star and <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1162/" title="Monday 12th May 2008: Google Reader shared items">share posts</a> and view my friends’ comments.</p>
<p>Now that I think of it, Google Reader was my Twitter from back in the day. Rather than being a single user blog reader desktop application, the key was you were sharing thoughts and stories with people you trusted, as well as just pulling feeds. I discovered so much stuff from Jim and Sparx and Atuuschaaw and the whole gang.</p>
<p>Google tweaked the UI several times during the service’s history, rendering the interface gradually uglier and more difficult to use, but <a title="Saturday 06th December 2008: Scripts to make Google Reader usable again!" href="//rubenerd.com/p3580/">with some simple Greasemonkey scripts</a> you could be back to the old goodness again without too much trouble.</p>

<h3>The beginning of the end</h3>
<p>The wheels started to come off for me when Google+ launched, and all those social features were stripped out in favour of a +1 button. It was obvious at this stage that Google saw no future in the service, and that they wanted everyone using Google+ to share and comment on stories. Like so many applications throughout tech history, it had become an awkward stepping stone we were all expected to accept and move off from.</p>
<p>(To be fair, I also jumped ship at this stage because they said <a href="//rubenerd.com/goodbye-googleplus/" title="Thursday 29th March 2012: Goodbye Google+, I hardly used thee">my name wasn’t real</a>. Stay classy, Google).</p>
<p>As with so many terminated sites, I’ll miss Google Reader for the community of people we had there. They’re probably mostly on Google+ now anyway given The J-Walk has abandoned blogging.</p>
<h3>Final random thoughts</h3>
<p>In looking for Google Reader replacements, it continued to baffle me that so many third party services relied on Google Reader to sync. I wonder how they’ll be dealing with this?</p>
<p>Also, I find it ironic that Bloglines, the original web-based blog reader that’s now owned by the tiny Merchant Circle, was able to outlive Reader, the service released by the Google Behemoth. The lesson here, backing from a huge company doesn’t always (in fact often doesn’t) buy security.</p>
