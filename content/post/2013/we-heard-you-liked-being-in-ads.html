<p>Google have <a title="Google Terms of Service update" href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/changes/">updated their Terms of Service</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When it comes to shared endorsements in ads, you can control the use of your Profile name and photo via the Shared Endorsements setting. If you turn the setting to ”off,” your Profile name and photo will not show up on that ad for your favorite bakery or any other ads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a developer and sysadmin, I know the vast majority of people don’t change settings. This means most people will have their likeness appearing in advertisements with this latest update. I give them props for giving us an opt-out, but claiming <em>“you’re in control of what you share”</em> with this default behavior comes across as a little disingenuous to me.</p>
<p>In unrelated news, I’ve used the word “jived” in two consecutive posts now. Let’s see if I can make it three!</p>
