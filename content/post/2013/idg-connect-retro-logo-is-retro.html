<p>While unsubscribing from an InfoWorld mailing list, I was presented with this rather fabulous 2-bit graphic above the final unsubscribe button. So many 1990s memories, flooding back…!</p>
<p>For what it’s worth though, the original GIF was only 4KiB, and I converted it to a 1KiB PNG. You could convey a lot with so little data back then.</p>
