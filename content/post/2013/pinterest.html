<p>A while ago I signed up to Pinterest, given a <a href="http://pinterest.com/source/rubenerd.com/">substantial amount of my uploaded media</a> has been appearing there. Then I promptly forgot about them.</p>
<p>An email they sent me this morning:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here at Pinterest… Get ready to change your life! We teamed up with The Biggest Loser to share tips from each episode. From Dolvett’s fitness guides to healthy recipes, The Biggest Loser (Mon 8/7c) on Pinterest has what you need to turn motivation into reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something tells me I haven’t been missing much.</p>
