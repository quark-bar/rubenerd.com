<p>A new <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/google-keepsave-whats-on-your-mind.html">product announcement from Google</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/google-keepsave-whats-on-your-mind.html"><p>
With Keep you can quickly jot ideas down when you think of them and even include checklists and photos to keep track of what’s important to you. Your notes are safely stored in Google Drive and synced to all your devices so you can always have them at hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not sure what they mean by &#8220;safely stored&#8221;. What’s certain (and unsurprising) though: no mention of privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Great tweet from <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/warrenellis/status/314493398138630145">@warrenellis</a>, in light of <a href="http://rubenerd.com/goodbye-google-reader/">Google Reader’s closure</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://mobile.twitter.com/warrenellis/status/314493398138630145"><p>Dear Google: why launch Google Keep when you’ve just proven you’ll shut off productivity services when you get bored with maintaining them?</p></blockquote>
