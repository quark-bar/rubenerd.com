<p>Last year, I focused on consolidating my disparate email inboxes into one system I could use. This year, I’ve been working hard to reduce the torrent of electronic mail hitting me in the inbox face each morning.</p>
<p>Taking another cue from Merlin Mann, I created a saved search in SeaMonkey Mail to match any email that includes the word &#8220;unsubscribe&#8221; in its body text. If you think about it for a moment, if a message includes &#8220;unsubscribe&#8221;, theres a good chance it’s a mass mailing we can live without. They’re many-to-many messages in an inbox that’s really only useful as a one-to-one or many-to-one inbox, to afford ourselves the use of some database terminology.</p>
<p>It was quite a shock! Of the 312 messages in my inbox, the filter identified 96 messages I hadn’t read, and could unsubscribe from. These included newsletters I never asked for, notifications from various sites, and reminders I already receive from other channels.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">(As an aside, isn’t it fascinating how rarely we perceive things unless we see them in aggregate? I’m sure a cognitive psychologist could come up with some interesting reasons for this).</p>
<p>With the exception of a few regular invoices and job boards, I swept through and unsubscribed form all of them. It’s my hope this leads to a more manageable inbox filled with messages I can act upon, rather than merely digest. The idea of digesting electrons is so absurd, anyway.</p>
<p>For the final step, I attempted to track down RSS feed versions of those many-to-many messages I wanted to keep. By putting newsletters from InfoWorld in Digg Reader instead of my inbox, I don’t feel the guilt of having so many unread inbox messages, though they’re still available in that less &#8220;urgent&#8221; channel. For mailing lists, I’ve subscribed to their news equivalents in Gmane.</p>
<p>These might be cop-outs in Merlin’s approach, but it works for me. ^_^</p>
