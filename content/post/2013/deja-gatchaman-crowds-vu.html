<p>As usual, I’ve let my anime reviews pile up like steamed mackerel on pineapple pizza. Rather than feeling guilty about catching up, I’m just going to write a spur-of-the-moment post about my first impressions of <em><strong>GATCH-A-MAN!</strong> Crowds</em>, the series <a href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> and I watched last night, and my friends <a rel="met friend co-worker" href="http://alonelyseptember.net/">Sebastian</a> and <a rel="met friend co-worker" href="http://jamiejakov.lv">Vadim</a> have talked incessently about.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, I haven’t felt this much <em>déjà vu</em> since the last time I felt this much <em>déjà vu</em>. Pratically everything from this series feels like it’s from somewhere else.</p>
<h3>The Technology</h3>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2013/anime.gatchaman.01.note.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I’m an IT guy, so we begin with the technology. Their NOTE book things they use to communite with other memebers of their elite, exclusive team remind me of the Selecao phones from <em>Eden of the East</em>. Now that I think about it, a lot of the series does, though with less male nudity.</p>
<h3>The Headquarters</h3>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2013/anime.gatchaman.01.yumekuimerry.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The eerie headquarters of the <strong>GATCH-A-MEN!</strong> on Earth remind me of that world the <a href="//rubenerd.com/my-princess-of-the-crystal-fig-finally-arrived/">Princess of the Crystal</a> takes her unwitting victims in <em>Mawaru Penguindrum</em>, or some of the <a href="//rubenerd.com/anime-yumekui-merry-08/">dream spaces</a> from <em>Yumekui Merry</em>, or even <em>Madoka Magica</em>. Naturally, lots of colours and busts of giant <span style="text-decoration:line-through">words</span> birds serve to make the headquarters more efficient.</p>
<h3>The Landscape</h3>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2013/anime.gatchaman.01.railgun.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>When the first episode started and I saw all this <a href="//rubenerd.com/anime-picture-it-cityscapes/">lovely scenery pr0n</a>, I thought <em>Railgun</em>. Speaking of which, I need to watch S2. Actually, there’s quite a lot I want to watch from this season; its unusual that I want to watch more than one show from each season, but we’re full on this time around!</p>
<h3>The Characters</h3>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2013/anime.gatchaman.01.fireemblem.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Hmm, the characters. To be honest, I have no idea. They all remind me of something, but I honestly can’t figure out what. Or who. Perhaps the artist or director had a role in something I’ve seen, but as an otaku approaching his late 20s my memory isn’t what she used to be. I do know O.D. reminded me a little of Fire Emblem from <em>Tiger and Bunny</em>, though he’ll have to be pretty wonderful to match him. I’m already liking his attire.</p>
<h3>The Costumes</h3>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2013/anime.gatchaman.01.bunny.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Speaking of which, the transformation costumes: <em>Tiger and Bunny</em>. Right down to the head gear with rabbit ears. I’m so cut that I didn’t see his voice actor at SMASH!</p>
<h3>The Utsu-tsu-tse</h3>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2013/anime.gatchaman.01.fs.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>After rolling my eyes during the OP, I noticed how much of a clone Utsu-tsu is of <a href="http://myanimelist.net/character/4835/Lum">Lum Invader</a> from the 1980s, right down to her hair style, hair colour and attire. Given the original <strong>GATCH-A-MAN!</strong> screened in the 1970s, I’m going to pretend this was the animators paying homage to classic anime again; it’ll make watching it easier.</p>
<h3>The Harvesting</h3>
<p>And finally, the harvesting. Of course, the NOTE was extracted from Hajime’s chest; whether it be <em>Penguindrum</em>, or <em>Guilty Crown</em> or any other recent series, the chest cavity seems to be the new Hammerspace. The NOTE being the soul of the <strong>GATCH-A-MAN!</strong> sounds like a Grief Seed to me. No wait, what was the positive version of that from <em>Madoka Magica</em>?</p>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>I’ll admit, I’m on the fence. <em>Free!</em> and <em>WataMote</em> are drowning in their epicness (and Neptunia is so delightfully inexplicable), so naturally <a href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> and I will be watching them to the end. I’ll give <strong>GATCH-A-MAN!</strong> an episode or two more to see if it can hook me.</p>
<p>What I will say though, its great to see some of this classic stuff come back again. I remember seeing the legendary <em>G</em> logo at the Japanese Club in Singapore when I was growing up; perhaps they had an employee who was a fan of the original. I loved that the music and <strong>GATCH-A-MAN!</strong> jingles harkened back to the original 1970s series, while still being fresh and new. I also love the bold colours and eerie familiarity I feel I have for a series I’ve never seen before. The seiyuu for the lead character is extremely talented, though suffice to say I’m not really a fan of the character she’s portraying so far!</p>
<p>We’ll see how this pans out.</p>
