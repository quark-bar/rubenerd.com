<p>A few million years ago, I celebrated her annual festivities by presenting her a virtual birthday crown made of grass. She’s no longer grass, so instead have a <a href="http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=33225707">four leaf clover</a>! Why? Because you don’t see them out all that often, but when you do they’re special and lucky ^_^.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t win the award for lamest birthday greeting she got today, I’ll be thoroughly disappointed.</p>
