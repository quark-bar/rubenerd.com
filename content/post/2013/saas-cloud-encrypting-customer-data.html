<p>Earlier this week, I <a href="http://rubenerd.com/zfs-on-freebsd-supporting-trim/">wrote about FreeBSD ZFS</a> and how deduping can take considerable amounts of memory. A commenter who wishes to remain anonymous took issue with this line:</p>
<blockquote><p>As an aside, it makes you appreciate why so many cloud vendors donâ€™t wish to encrypt data; such processing would render even the most sophisticated deduper utterly useless.</p></blockquote>
<p>This line was phrased in the context of a cloud vendor wishing to save costs, not the wishes of their customers. If storage was constrained, it would make sense to dedupe if possible.</p>
<p>Encryption &#8220;breaks&#8221; deduplication (and by extension, compression). The mark of a high quality algorithm is pseudo-random noise, such that there are as few repeating patterns as possible.</p>
<p>Of course, encrypting the same individual files will result in the same ciphertext, right? I suppose it comes down to implementation.</p>
