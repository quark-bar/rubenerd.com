<p>After (what I assume, given their size) a couple of decades shading university students from the Sydney sun, the current round of construction at <a title="University of Technology, Sydney" href="http://uts.edu.au">UTS</a> has uprooted some of the most beautiful trees on campus. Barely a month ago, <a rel="friend met co-worker kin muse crush date sweetheart" href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> and I were sharing some lunch at a table under those calming, leafy towers.</p>
<p>Judging from the leftover roots and irregular sized holes in the ground, the trees were cut down and <a title="Lowe's: Transplant Trees and Shrubs" href="http://www.lowes.com/cd_Transplant+Trees+and+Shrubs_674265371_">not transplanted</a>. What an absolute waste.</p>
