<p>I am fully aware of the (albeit reversed) insinuation <a href="http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=32719446">kaeru on Pixiv</a> was… insinuating. Still, after a <a href="//rubenerd.com/hot-damn-sydney/" title="Tuesday 08th January 2013: Hot damn, Sydney">full day of heat in Sydney yesterday</a>, and a terribly hot sticky night (I’m not doing anything to help this insinuation), the late morning was positively refreshing by comparison.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how one merely has to spend a day being blown at by nature’s hair dryer to render an otherwise normal summer day with a gentle sea breeze feel so wonderful.</p>
<p>The WordPress ID for this entry is 10707, the ending of which was <a href="//rubenerd.com/retro-business-jet/">Boeing’s first commercial jetliner</a>. I’m going to pretend this was done on purpose somehow to coincide with my passing mention of breezes. That made sense in my head.</p>
