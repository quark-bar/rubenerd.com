<blockquote><p>After closure of Building 5 and the Library for the rest of last week, seems like most things are returning back to normal. They have been open <span style="text-decoration:line-through">for business</span> since 8.00am today for most classes except Postgraduate business which was relocated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A huge relief to business students and those living in the student housing. As Clara said, I hope there arenâ€™t too many soggy carpets left to dry out.</p>
