<p>It’s with a heavy, nostalgic heart that I bid farewell to the Camino web browser. According to the last blog post on the Camino site, it’s no longer being actively developed.</p>
<p>Camino was Mozilla done right on the Mac. It took the same Gecko rendering engine from Firefox, wrapped it in native Mac Cocoa instead of XUL, added keychain support, and a bunch of other useful Mac features. It had a quintessentially Aqua icon, and tastefully coloured toolbar buttons that dared to challenge the plain toolbars of Safari.</p>
<p>I loved Firefox on Windows and *nix, but was less than impressed with its performace on my iBook G3 with Panther and Tiger in the early 2000s. <a href="//rubenerd.com/universal-binaries-for-mozilla-software/">I made the switch</a>, and only moved back to Firefox on my Macs a few years ago. I like having all my security and privacy extensions back in Firefox, but I still think the user experience in Camino is superior.</p>
<p>I wish all the developers the best in their newer, greener pastures in Safari, Firefox and Chrome development. And thank you.</p>
