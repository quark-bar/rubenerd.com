<p>Just so I understand what’s going on: Gizmodo Australia writes an article asking <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2013/02/how-stupid-are-you-willing-to-look-for-apples-magical-iwatch/">how stupid people are willing to look for Apple</a>, and uses a photo of me wearing an iPod nano watch to illustrate it. I leave a comment, and it gets deleted.</p>
<p>You can read the original in full on <a href="//rubenerd.com/gizmodo-australia-said-i-looked-stupid/">my post from earlier this week</a>. In short, I calmly defended the reasons why I use an iPod nano watch, criticised their inflammatory headlines, and made a subtle dig at their US counterparts. Certainly nothing as rude, trollish or condescending as what Sam Biddle wrote in the original article, though apparently enough to warrant deletion.</p>
<p>I’m not looking for an apology, Gizmodo Australia have every right to delete my comment. It could have even been a technical or editorial mistake, or perhaps I was downvoted by the same users who have left far more inflammatory and rude comments than what I did.</p>
<p>Either way, stay classy Gizmodo Australia. I usually have a sense of humour about things like this, but this just wasn’t cool.</p>
