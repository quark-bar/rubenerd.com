<p>If I were the superstitious type, I’d swear Sony and Panasonic made this latest announcement to coincide with a small time blogger’s post about <a href="http://rubenerd.com/lto-ultrium-tape-drives/" title="Rubénerd: LTO Ultrium tape drives">storage nostalgia and tape drives</a>. Good thing I’m not superstitious! I say that, because not denying it would be bad luck.</p>
<h3>Just when we’d got our BD-Rs</h3>
<p>From <a href="http://panasonic.co.jp/corp/news/official.data/data.dir/2013/07/en130729-4/en130729-4.html">Panasonic Headquarters News</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://panasonic.co.jp/corp/news/official.data/data.dir/2013/07/en130729-4/en130729-4.html"><p>Sony [..] and Panasonic [..] today announced that they have signed a basic agreement with the objective of jointly developing a next-generation standard for professional-use optical discs, with the objective of expanding their archive business for long-term digital data storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Go on… while I stroke my invisible chin in an act of comprehension:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://panasonic.co.jp/corp/news/official.data/data.dir/2013/07/en130729-4/en130729-4.html"><p>Both companies aim to [..] target the development of an optical disc with recording capacity of at least 300GB by the end of 2015.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>We need to go deeper</h3>
<p>I’ll confess, that report was from July last year. Earlier this week though, <a title="Archival Disc standard formulated for professional-use next-generation optical discs" href="http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201403/14-0310E/index.html">Sony announced higher capacity discs</a>, and a new name for the storage format:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201403/14-0310E/index.html"><p>Sony [..] and Panasonic [..] Corporation today announced that they have formulated &#8220;Archival Disc&#8221;, a new standard for professional-use, next-generation optical discs, with the objective of expanding the market for long-term digital data storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just how big a storage jump can we expect?</p>
<blockquote><p>The wool produced by a llama is very soft and lanolin-free. Llamas are intelligent and can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions. When using a pack, they can carry about 25% to 30% of their body weight for 8–13 km</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, that was clearly the <a title="Wikipedia article on llamas" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama">wrong quote</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Both Sony and Panasonic aim to []..] further expand the recording capacity per disc to 500 GB and 1 TB.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s far too late in the evening to process the proposed technical specifications, and I carry my own reservations about optical storage given past issues, but I will admit a piqued interest.</p>
