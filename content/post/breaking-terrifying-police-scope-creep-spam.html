<p>Hey, I could work at Buzzfeed. Today's fun spam message comes from the Australian Federal Police:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is self produced message, you are free to delist from mailinglist.</p>

</blockquote>

Leave aside the unsurprisinglyâ€“bad grammar, punctuation, capitalisation, and likely use of American dates. Ignore the fact I don't even drive or own a car. 

The Australian Federal Police have assumed the roles of the New South Wales state police. And you Texans were scared!
