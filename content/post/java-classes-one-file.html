<p>I got so much helpful feedback from friendly people here with my last Java question I thought I&#39;d try again with another problem that&#39;s been gnawing at me for a few days. It&#39;s probably just a matter of scope, but I want to be sure!</p>

<p>Say for example I have a very basic <strong>Train</strong> class and within it I have <strong>Carriage</strong> objects. In this example the private <strong>Carriage</strong> class is within the class Train:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
public class Train {
  Carriage[] carriages = new Carriage[10];

  public Train() {
    // constructor stuff
  }

  private class Carriage {
    public Carriage() {
      // constructor stuff
    }
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>In this version Carriage is within the same file, but is a different class. This also compiles, but if I try to append a private keyword Java throws a <code>&quot;modifier not allowed here&quot;</code> error.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
public class Train {
  Carriage[] carriages = new Carriage[10];

  public Train() {
    // constructor stuff
  }
}

class Carriage {
  public Carriage() {
    // constructor stuff
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically I need to know what the functional difference is between the two. Both compile and can be used; on my machine here I added a bunch of toString() methods and fleshed out their constructors and got identical output with each version. Is it simply a matter of scope? Is one approach more acceptable or preferred?</p>
