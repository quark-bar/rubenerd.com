<p>Serendipidous art seems to be a theme for <em>Rubénerd</em> this month! We&#39;ve had <a href="http://localhost:4000/accidental-jpeg-wiphalas/" title="Rubénerd: Accidental JPEG Wiphalas">accidental JPEG wiphalas</a>, then <a href="http://rubenerd.com/speaking-of-broken-jpegs/" title="Rubénerd: Speaking of broken JPEGs">accidental JPEG artefacts</a>, then we had this draft post you&#39;re reading right now that I never got around to posting.</p>
<p>For you see, after reading technical documents all day, the last thing I want to read—and the last thing the web needs—is another dry website with no images. Thus, since I first started this site almost a decade ago, I&#39;ve endeavored to include them in posts. Even if said images had as much point as a round room, or the pencil at the end of my desk that&#39;s staring at me, judging me. It&#39;s just another service I provide to you, dear reader, because I respect your time and attention.</p>
<p>For an accompanying image to my rumination regarding a <a href="http://rubenerd.com/total-non-recall/" title="Total">lack of ATM PIN mindfulness</a>, I hit up <a href="http://konachan.net/" title="G-rated anime art image board">Konachan.net</a> and typed “ATM”. Without any results, the site suggested that I meant “beatmania”, and showed this.</p>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/2014/anime.beatmania.jpg" alt="" style="width:500px; height:312px;" /></p>
<p>What can I say, I&#39;m a sucker for bows! But we digress. Which is to say, I digress.</p>
<p>Having reached this dead end, I typed “cash” instead. The site suggested I meant “whiscash”, and showed the image below. Admittedly that <em>is</em> closer to the original title than “Beatmania”.</p>

<p>Clearly, next time I need more epic desktop background material, I should type seemingly random strings into image boards.</p>
<p>Alas, I can&#39;t find the source for either of these artists; it seems their Pixiv pages have long since been deleted. Once I know who, I&#39;ll link to them here.</p>
