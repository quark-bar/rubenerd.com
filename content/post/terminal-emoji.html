<p>I never thought I'd see it, but we have real graphics in our terminals. Granted, they're fonts with emoji the OS may render as an image, but the point stands.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> team include their namesake beverage in output. Some <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/625021/how-do-i-make-my-shell-prompt-look-like-a-cheeseburger">bash burgers</a>. Personally, I've started adding <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2615/index.htm">hot unicode beverages</a> to script output, which OS X renders as a lovely emoji cup of coffee:

<pre>
☕ &nbsp; Fluxing capacitors...
[STDOUT...]
☕ &nbsp; Building dependencies...
[STDOUT...]
☕ &nbsp; Grading zettai ryoiki...
[STDOUT...]
☕ &nbsp; Changes now LIVE. Have a nice day
</pre>

<p>These visual markers really stand out in a sea of output. I've yet to push them into prod for anything other than personal deployments though; I don't think the world is ready for that.</p>
