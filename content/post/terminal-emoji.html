<p>I never thought I'd see it, but we have real graphics in our terminals. Granted, they're fonts with emoji the OS may render as an image, but the point stands. Pontifications over how positive a development this is I leave as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>The Homebrew team include their namesake beverage in output. Some put burgers in their bash. Personally, I've started adding coffee.

<p>These visual markers really stand out in a sea of output. I've yet to push them into prod for anything other than personal deployments though.</p>
