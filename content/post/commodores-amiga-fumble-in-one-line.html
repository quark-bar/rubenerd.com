<p>Best description I&#39;ve ever read, from <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1653062&#038;cid=32216022">i<em>want</em>you<em>to</em>throw_ (559379)</a> on Slashdot.</p>
<p>The photo is of a giant perspex Amiga sign I salvaged from a shopping centre in Malaysia that was going to throw it away. I hurriedly took a picture with my iTelephone for this post, but I&#39;ll upload a better one from my Nikon D60 soon :)</p>
