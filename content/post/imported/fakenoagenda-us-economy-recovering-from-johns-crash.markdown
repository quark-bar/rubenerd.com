*This post originally appeared on [FakeNoAgenda], a **parody** site a few fans and I ran.*

[The Associated Press](http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/obama-wants-to-shift-focus-to-u-s-economic-progress-1.1557085):

> In his weekly radio and Internet address, Obama is seeking to shift the focus away from negative headlines. He says jobs have been created, the auto industry is recovering and deficits are falling.

In light of shadow stats and boots on the ground, we beg to differ. John said the US economy would collapse in October 2013, and it did. Right?
