*This post originally appeared on [FakeNoAgenda], a **parody** site a few fans and I ran.*

[Quentin Fottrell has a column in Market Watch](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-things-billionaires-wont-tell-you-2013-11-15?link=sfmw_sm) explaining what billionaires apparently won't tell us. They didn't include the most obvious: **that they're lizard people**.

Since John stopped writing for them, they've really gone downhill. I'm glad they dedicated a segment to detailing exactly the circumstances surrounding his departure. I mean, if they weren't fully transparent, it'd be pretty hypocritical.
