<p>From <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/23/steve-ballmer-promises-over-500-new-features-in-mango-teases/">Engadget</a>. Not to <a title="Steve Ballmer, mua har har" href="http://rubenerd.com/steve-ballmer-mua-har-har/">harp on</a> about Mr Ballmer, but his enthusiasm for his new Windows Phone devices seemsâ€¦ <strong>muted</strong>? Is he frustrated that his marketing department have embarrassingly started naming his mobile OSs after food as well?</p>
<p>Presumably there&#39;s a button on the devices to fix that. See what I did there?</p>
