summary: "Or why each line starts with hint"
---
<p>Weâ€™ve likely all seen git errors like this at some point:</p>

<pre>
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
</pre>

<p>Each time I see it, I read it like this:</p>

<blockquote>
