<p>The <a href="http://singaporesearchsite.com/">Singapore Search Site</a> has <a href="http://singaporesearchsite.com/singapore-tips/24-hour-shop-directory/">started a list</a> of 24 hour shops and businesses in Singapore which given the name of the site makes sense. Whatever they&#39;re paying me, it isn&#39;t enough. Or too much. Don&#39;t prey prey prey PCK will be back.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://singaporesearchsite.com/singapore-tips/24-hour-shop-directory/"><p>Below is a 24-hour shop directory containing the website (with address) of shops and services in Singapore that operate round-the-clock. Be it entertainment, food, medical or shopping, we have you covered with all the places and services you may need.</p></blockquote>
<p>So far the listings are contained in seven subheadings: Clinics, Entertainment, Food Courts, Fast Food / Restaurants, Convenience Stores, Supermarkets and Shopping Malls.</p>
<p>Right off the bat I can see they don&#39;t have any listings for 24 hour prata anywhere, not even under Restaurants. 24 hour prata is so important that I&#39;d argue it deserves its own subheating! Did I say &quot;subheating&quot;, I meant subheading. Don&#39;t study all day, drink litres off coffee, get all depressed then attempt to write a witty blog post.</p>
<p>I could go for some prata and teh tarik from Mr Prata on Evans Road right about now, anyone in Singapore want to air freight me some here to Adelaide? It&#39;d really help during my exams!</p>
