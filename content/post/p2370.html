<p>When I claimed <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p2300/">this was going to be the last post</a> on the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/macbook-firewire-debacle/">MacBook FireWire Debacle</a>, I didn&#39;t think another writer would share a similar view to me on this issue. <em>This will be the last post!</em> Ironically, I found about <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/edwardbaig/2008-10-23-macbook_N.htm?sr=hotnews">this USAToday article</a> through <a href="http://www.apple.com/startpage/">Apple&#39;s official start page</a> which chose to summarise the article as such:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple, says Edward C. Baig (usatoday.com), “has fashioned a winner with the new MacBook.” The new model features a “bold new metal design with a glossy backlit widescreen LED display, spacious buttonless trackpad and souped-up Nvidia graphics for gamers.” In fact, Baig reports being “pleased with the detail and fluid motion as I played Spore from Electronic Arts and Call of Duty 4 from Activision.</p></blockquote>
<p>Conveniently they didn&#39;t disclose any of Edward&#39;s comments regarding the lack of a FireWire port, and the less than adequate number of USB ports as replacements:</p>
<blockquote><p>But Apple risks ticking off users who rely on FireWire. Like many people, I still have a FireWire camcorder, not to mention an external FireWire hard drive. Apple may want to drive customers to the FireWire-capable MacBook Pro — models that start at $1,999 — which are certainly better equipped for video editing.</p>
<p>The company also figures many of the folks who would do a lot of video editing own newer camcorders that more likely use USB rather than FireWire. Apple isn’t generous there, either: There are just two USB ports on the new MacBooks.</p>
<p>You can still get FireWire on the entry-level plastic MacBook, but it doesn’t have the muscle for heavy-duty video editing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly! I am so fed up with reading comments from people that tell people who can&#39;t afford a MacBook Pro to buy an older MacBook that still has FireWire for video editing, or that people who need FireWire should buy a MacBook Pro. Not everyone is swimming in money.</p>
<p>If you think I&#39;ve started to dislike Apple though over this hiccup, the last line of Edward&#39;s article pretty much sums up my own opinion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple has fashioned a winner with the new MacBook. Unless you can’t live without FireWire.</p></blockquote>
