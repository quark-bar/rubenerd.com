<p>Anime hipsters call moeblob anime a virus, but I'm sure <em>they</em> didn't even know it really was in the early 1990s! I caught a glance of this virus definition in my PC DOS 7 VM, with IBM's bundled AntiVirus.</p>

<p>For those who don't know, Asusa was the cutest character from K-On!, one of the most moe anime series of all time.</p>
