<p>It&#39;s <a href="http://twitter.com/Tarale/status/6496430192">@Tarale&#39;s birthday</a> and all she got from <a href="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd/">@Rubenerd</a> was an animated gif of someone eating birthday cake that he <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/34069005@N06/3288333163/">didn&#39;t even</a> create himself! Neither the cake nor the animated gif! The scandal! That is, unless she was born on the 11th of December and lied about her birthday for tax purposes, in which case there&#39;s an even bigger scandal than my ripping off of an image. Right about now, the funk soul brother. Bird is the Word!</p>
