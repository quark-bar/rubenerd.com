<p>I've now been subscribed to Wrike's email newsletters, whick I <a href="http://rubenerd.com/youre-subscribed-to-our-new-mailing-list/">never asked for</a>. Here was the first subject line:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Time-saving Updates to Start Your Summer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They have my address, they know I'm in the southern hemisphere. I'm going to assume they were sending me this six months early, rather than they didn't bother to check.</p>

<p>Wrike is a project management site we trialled for work. It's okay.</p>
