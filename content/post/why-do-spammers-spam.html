<p>In 2007, Raj over on BlogHash asked <a href="http://www.bloghash.com/2007/09/why-do-spammers-spam-blogs/">Why do spammers spam blogs?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Spammers should know that over 99% of the time their comments are taken care by anti-spam plugins like Akismet, 0.5% times manual intervention of a blog owner marks their comments as spam, and the rest of the time they succeed. When the success rate is below 1%, why spam? Why not spend that valuable time of yours to do something worth?</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though it&#39;s two years later, I still know the not very PC answer: <strong><em>Because they&#39;re dumb!</em></strong> Thank you.</p>
