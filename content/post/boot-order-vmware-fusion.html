<p>I can never seem to remember this line, so I&#39;ve decided to put it here. If you want access to the BIOS in <a href="http://vmware.com/mac/">VMware Fusion</a> virtual machines so you can change the device boot order and so forth, add the following line to the machine&#39;s .vmx file:</p>
<pre>bios.forceSetupOnce = "TRUE"</pre>
<p>When you reboot the VM will load the BIOS configuration screen without you having to frantically press a command key like F2 or DEL. When you reboot, the default behaviour returns.</p>
<p>The problem is, Fusion VMs are configured by default to boot from the hard drive first then the optical drive, meaning once you&#39;ve installed an OS it ignores booting from the optical drive entirely. This will let you take care of this.</p>
