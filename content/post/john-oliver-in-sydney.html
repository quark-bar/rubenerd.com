<p>Yesterday evening, the <em>Sydney Morning Herald</em> <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/sydney-fc/aleague-grand-final-tickets-scalped-at-485-per-cent-of-face-value-20150511-ggz4ld.html">ran this</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Desperate fans fork out for tickets</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They could have only been talking about John Oliver’s Australia tour. How Clara and I kept refreshing that Ticketmaster page, in vain attempts to secure seats to see that star of <em>The Daily Show</em> and <em>Last Week Tonight</em> perform in Sydney. We were even putting thought into how we'd print some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UsHHOCH4q8">Jeff the Diseased Lung</a> shirts to wear.

<p>But, despite spending more time and effort into pre–ordering this experience than some throwaway electronic device (that people keep asking me whether I've got or not), the tickets was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS">not to be</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The A-League grand final is being held at its smallest venue yet. Scalpers are cashing in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh, that’s what the article was discussing? How about (between you and me), we pretend it was regarding Mr Oliver. It’ll make coping easier.</p>
