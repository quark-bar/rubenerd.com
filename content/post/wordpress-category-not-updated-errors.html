<p>When trying to update a category description in WordPress 4.1, I got this cheerful message in green:</p>
<blockquote><p>Category not updated</p></blockquote>
<p>In my case, I had a category and tag with the same slug. Changing to a unique slug allowed the form to be submitted successfully, and the category updated.</p>
<p>WordPress stores categories and tags in databases the same way, likely due to the fact <a href="http://rubenerd.com/simpletags-for-wordpress/">tags were an afterthought</a>. WordPress will generally try to prevent such unique ID clashes from occurring, but they must still slip through the cracks.</p>
<p>Interesting though that WordPress doesnâ€™t enforce slug uniqueness at the database level.</p>
