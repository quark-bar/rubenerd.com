<p>BBC World reports from The World which is useful for me because I live there. Genius, right? One of their latest stories concerns a NASA mission whereby they&#39;ll be deliberately crashing two spacecraft into the moon to determine whether or not water ice exists.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://twitter.com/bbcworld" style="font-weight:bold">@bbcworld</a>: Nasa is set to deliberately crash two spacecraft into the Moon to try to learn whether there is water-ice on i.. <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8297811.stm">http://bit.ly/hqUYM</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Well that blockquote didn&#39;t really introduce anything I hadn&#39;t already mentioned. I&#39;m better at summarising than I thought I was.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the knee jerk reaction I had initially (&quot;oh great, humans are going to start dumping garbage on the moon now!&quot;) I thought of a way they could accomplish this without having to invest money in new procedures. Get a team together and inform them they want a probe that will orbit the moon, and make sure some of the contractors are programming in metres, some in feet. We know this works already!</p>
<p>I say this with confidence because I&#39;m perfect and never make mistakes, of course.</p>
