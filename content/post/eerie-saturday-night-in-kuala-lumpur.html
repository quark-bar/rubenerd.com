<p>Wow, Chinese New Year is almost upon us, and it feels very strange. Here I am in <a href="http://www.klcc.com.my/">KLCC</a>, the <a href="www.suriaklcc.com.my/">Petronas Twin Towers</a>, the premier building in Malaysia and there are no Chinese people… anywhere! For once I&#39;m walking around and all I see are Malays, Indians and Caucasians. There&#39;s nothing wrong with it, it just feels very eerie!</p>
<p>Of course Chinese New Year here in Malaysia is a big deal given the Chinese are the largest and most visible ethnic group after the Malays. It&#39;s even more so in Singapore where the vast majority are Chinese. The closest I can come to describing it would be to compare Singapore on Chinese New Year to Australia, North America or Europe on Christmas Day. Just this feeling of deserted-ness… very strange.</p>
<p>Wishing all my Chinese friends (and my Chinese-obsessed ang moh friends) a happy, healthy and prosperous year of the boar.</p>
