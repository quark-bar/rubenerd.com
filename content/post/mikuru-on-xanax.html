<p>As I was walking through Borders in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelock_Place">Wheelock Place</a> last night taking a break from scanning (topic for a future post no doubt) and checking my tweets on my iTelephone (that just sounds wrong for some reason) <a href="http://twitter.com/jlist/status/8764434599">@Jlist made a remark</a> about Haruhi.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/jlist/status/8764434599"><p>Man, if Haruhi really existed she would totally need to be on meds. #anime</p></blockquote>
<p>Quizás, quizás, quizás! Of course I read that as I was walking past the manga section and saw Haruhi staring at me from a shelf with a sinister smile. I take that to be a sign that the latest universe she created has her trapped in paper form and scaring the crap out of timid white boys late at night, and I expect she&#39;s getting a royal kick out of it!</p>
<p>But I digress. <a href="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd/status/8764535680">I commented on The Twitters</a> that if Haruhi is on the mad pills, Mikuru must be on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanax">Xanax!</a> :D</p>
<blockquote><p>Alprazolam, also known under the trade [name] Xanax is a short-acting drug of the benzodiazepine class. It is primarily used to treat moderate to severe <strong>anxiety disorders</strong> and <strong>panic attacks</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Though I suppose if Mikuru was on Xanax she wouldn&#39;t be able to do as effective a <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=mikuru+beam">Mikuru Beam</a> and she wouldn&#39;t be as jittery and moe, so she&#39;s probably under contract from producers not to take any. Just taking a stab in the dark here.</p>
<p>For me anxiety is best alleviated with hugs. My mum gave the best hugs, of course :(. Any volunteers?</p>
