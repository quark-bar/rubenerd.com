<p>Okay, I caved. Again.</p>
<p>Looking into WordPress again. I was just reading John C. Dvorak&#39;s (http://dvorak.org/blog/) and even he&#39;s using it, high praise indeed. I still don&#39;t like using databases though for such small projects, just had bad experiences with them too often in the past. Then again, I&#39;m still giving some thought to it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the problem: I want to have a blog, and at the moment I&#39;m using RapidWeaver for Mac OS X, which is actually a brilliant program. But therein lies the catch: my PowerMac G5 has OS X on it, but my only laptop (my G3 iBook) has Gentoo Linux 2005.1 on it because OS X runs so slowly on it; Gentoo runs lightning fast on it. Anyway so when I go to Malaysia and Singapore for Christmas to see the Mumster and the Father (and the sissta) I won&#39;t have a Mac to post on this blog!</p>
<p>There&#39;s also something appealing with having a server-side program doing this stuff too, not a client based program; it would eliminate all the uploading step altogether.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll have to check with Servage (my webhost) and see how easy it is to do database backups, because I&#39;m thinking of moving off them for good. I&#39;m so fed up with their slow and unreliable FTP server, and EVERY mp3 podcast file I uploaded for The Rubenerd Show was corrupted. I&#39;ve managed to upload all my files to my account on Ourmedia which uses the Internet Archives server space, so it&#39;s miles faster and more reliable. With this in mind it&#39;s not really necessary for me to have a web host that provides gigs upon gigs of space anymore, especially considering I&#39;m a uni student and don&#39;t exactly have millions of dollars to throw around!</p>
