<p>I&#39;ve now got a profile and account on Technorati!</p>

<p>Technorati is a site about blogs/weblogs/podcasts and the people behind them. What I think is pretty wicked is that you can type in a search term or phrase (such as… &#39;rubenerd&#39;) and it will search all the weblogs in its directory every few minutes for the term, and post the results in an easy-to-digest summary page, and in an RSS feed you can subscribe to. Brilliant.</p>
<p>Of course, if you&#39;ve been into blogging for ages, you&#39;d know about this already… but still.</p>
