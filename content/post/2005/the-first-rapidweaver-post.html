<blockquote><p>This post was originally created using a very slick client side Mac application called <a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/">RapidWeaver</a>. It made creating my third weblog and posts very easy, but being client side meant I needed to upload every small change, and it wasn’t free or open source. I moved over to WordPress a year later: forth time’s the charm right?

<p>Well I&#39;ve caved in.</p>
<p>For about a year now I&#39;ve been sending out my voice in this world through podcasting; I think it&#39;s worked okay in some respects, but I&#39;ve faced the fact that the audio medium is extremely clumsy for posting small snippets or ideas that come to me on an hourly basis through the day. I loved using del.icio.us and many a time I found myself posting links with detailed comments; then the idea dawned on me: how about a weblog instead? I mean, it&#39;s pretty much what I was doing anyway, might as well go the next step!</p>
<p>With all the hype and talk that video and audio podcasts have been recieving lately I&#39;m going back to basics with a simple, no frills weblog designed to supplement my podcast.</p>
