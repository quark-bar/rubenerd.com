<p>Being a (generally) open source advocate and user I shudder when people say that they can&#39;t kick their Microsoft addiction (Windows, Office, SQL Server, Phua Chu Kang Pte Ltd) because either they&#39;re so dependent on it and have developed infrastructure that can&#39;t easily be replaced with alternatives, or they&#39;re just so accustomed to Microsoft stuff they can&#39;t see themselves changing.</p>
<p>The truth is you don&#39;t need to ditch everything Microsoft you use in one go, it can be a gradual processes. Just like an addiction to illicit drugs or tobacco the best way to kick the habit is through a gradual transition processâ€¦ my German uncle quit cold turkey but most of us don&#39;t have the ability!</p>
<h3>Step One</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re in a sinking ship you don&#39;t bother re-painting the staterooms! This means you should stop adopting even more Microsoft products. Don&#39;t upgrade your expensive software to the latest versions (Windows, Office, SQL Server, Phua Chu Kang Pte Ltd) which inevitably will deepen your dependence on Microsoft.</p>
<h3>Step Two</h3>
<p>Develop some form of roadmap that <em>you want to follow</em>, not what Microsoft wants you to. Your software should adapt to what you want to do, not the other way around.</p>
<h3>Step Three</h3>
<p>Start using alternative programmes where it&#39;s feasible or appropriate. Use <a href="http://mozilla.com/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> instead of Internet Explorer, <a href="http://openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> instead of Microsoft Office and so forth.</p>
<p>Understandably, if you don&#39;t want to take the plunge of installing new software that you&#39;re not used to on your production machines, consider trying out a <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1849711,00.asp">memory key toolkit</a> that has open source software on it: this way you can try the software before you commit to it.</p>
<h3>Step Four</h3>
<p>When you&#39;re comfortable using alternative open source programmes, you&#39;ll realise that Windows is not actually necessary any more! Take a look at some of the very polished alternative operating systems such as <a href="http://www.kubuntu.org/">Ubuntu Linux</a> or <a href="http://www.pcbsd.org/">PC-BSD</a>! Again take it slowly and try before you buy, so to speak.</p>
<p>For programmes you must run such as Adobe Photoshop, there&#39;s always Mac ^^. Although they can be just as expensive as Microsoft products, and aren&#39;t entirely open source, it&#39;s still a good platform  and much more trustworthy.</p>
<h3>Step Five</h3>
<p>Take a nice long holiday with the money you&#39;ve saved from paying expensive Microsoft taxes, and with the reassurance you&#39;ve gained from the improved reliability and quality of the software your business is using. And send a check for 10,000 Singapore Dollars to Ruben Schade. Hey, it can&#39;t hurt right?</p>
