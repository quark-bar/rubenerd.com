<p>With all this furore about the <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/ipad-flash-is-google-ie6/">iPad not having Flash</a>, I thought I&#39;d share this screenshot. Yes Adobe, I would have begrudgingly installed your Flash drug in the past because I felt as though I <em>&quot;needed&quot;</em> it, but having been forced to give it up when I moved most of my machines to FreeBSD (which you don&#39;t support) I was forced to get clean and as a consequence I no longer use it even on platforms you <em>do</em> support!</p>
<p>Friends, don&#39;t let friends use Flash.</p>
