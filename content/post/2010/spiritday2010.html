<p>I’m too tired to write a full post now, but I wore a purple scarf around Sydney today for #SpiritDay to raise awareness of gay bullying. Got a few strange looks, but a very attractive young man shook my hand on Elizabeth St and thanked me. To be honest I really wasn’t doing his cause much at all, I can’t imagine the kind of crap he has to go through on a daily basis.</p>
<p>It’s saddening that in the 21st century gay people are still persecuted and that a day like this even needs to exist at all. Love is love folks.</p>

<p>As I always say in my typical cliché form:<br />
<cite>Peace, health and happiness</cite></p>
