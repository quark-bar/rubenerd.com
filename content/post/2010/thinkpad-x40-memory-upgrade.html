<p>Last year I picked up a second hand <a title="All my blog posts about the ThinkPad X40" href="//rubenerd.com/tag/thinkpad-x40/">ThinkPad X40</a> for a ridiculously cheap price, and this afternoon I finally got around to adding more memory. In a Department of Obviousness exclusive, it made an already stunningly awesome machine ever better!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>Default configuration</h3>
<p>IBM originally sold the ThinkPad X40 with 512MiB of memory soldered onto the motherboard and an empty PC-2700 333MHz slot for upgrading.</p>
<p>Unfortunately IBM manufactured several distinct models of the X40 which have different memory ceilings; you can find out which one you have by looking at the IBM label on the underside of the case. Crucial.com advised me my 7290 supported a maximum 1GiB of extra memory, so I want to Sim Lim Square and was lucky enough to still find a shop selling it!</p>
<p>I went with a Kingston 1GiB module for SG$75 and it&#39;s been working great :).</p>

<h3>Day to day performance</h3>
<p>I couldn&#39;t really tell any difference in performance booting FreeBSD, but Fedora 12 was somewhat  faster. The real difference came down in operation; with 512MiB of memory I could get to a pretty Gnome or Xfce desktop but as soon as I loaded up a few tabs in Firefox things would start slowing down. Looking now I have 13 tabs open and the machine is just as fast as when I booted it!</p>
<p>Last year I was disappointed that I couldn&#39;t try OpenSolaris on this machine because it didn&#39;t meet it&#39;s memory requirements, but I suppose now I could give that a shot too. Now that Oracle owns Sun now though, I&#39;m less enthusiastic at that prospect.</p>

<h3>The NeXTSTEP</h3>
<p>I bought this X40 for cheap because I thought it&#39;d be a nice little netbook with a keyboard that&#39;s actually usable, but I&#39;m surprised at how much production work I&#39;m now getting done on it!</p>
<p>In light of this, the next step is to upgrade Fedora to 13! Oh yeah and the hard drive. The only design problem with the X40 is it uses a 1.8 inch ZIF hard drive which means most magnetic and SLC solid state drives for it are either painfully expensive or simply unavailable.</p>
<p>The performance of the current hard drive is acceptable and it&#39;s still in excellent health considering it&#39;s age, but <a href="http://gnuru.org/article/1497/installing-linux-on-thinkpad-x40-with-cf-drive#">this post on gnuru.org</a> about using a CF card intrigues me. Apparently read/write cycles in modern CF cards have been drastically improved from the mean old days, and it would be a great way to improve battery life and add even more performance.</p>
<p>I left a comment for posterity :).</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year I bought a used ThinkPad X40 to use as a lightweight alternative to my heavy MacBook Pro. One of the best investments I’ve ever made, I LOVE this machine! And as Mario said here, the keyboard is so much better than a netbook, even if Dave Winer shot me down in flames for suggesting so on Scripting.com ;).</p>
<p>The original 40GB HDD still works in mine, but I’m intrigued about what performance improvement I’d get from using a CF card and a ZIF-CF adaptor. The general responsiveness of FreeBSD and Fedora are both fine, but booting is a bit slow and initial booting takes a while.</p>
<p>Thanks for your post, I’ll be checking this out :)</p></blockquote>
