<p>Some <a href="http://www.railpage.org.au/pix/electric/nsw.html">pictures</a> are just so epic they deserve a mention, despite the fact they have nothing to do with the content of the blog upon which they&#39;re being published. In this case, the photo is of a Sydney suburban Tangara train, and the blog in question is the one you&#39;re reading right now. See what I did there?</p>
<blockquote><p>G30-G28 bursts through the &#8216;wall’  as the first official train on the new &#8216;Y-Link’ between Harris Park and Merrylands [in Sydney]. 2/11/96.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are so many puns I could break out with this, but I can&#39;t bust out any good ones. You&#39;d think I&#39;d be able to make light work of the walls surrounding this picture, but I&#39;d probably crumble at any attempt. No breakthroughs here, I&#39;m afraid. Herp derp. Hey look, a train!</p>
