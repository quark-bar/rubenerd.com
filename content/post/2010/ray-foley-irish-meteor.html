<p>Just a quick post to inform you all I voted for Ray Foley for the Irish Meteor radio awards! Not sure if international SMS text messages are counted, but budda diddly boom! <strong><em>&quot;The Ray Foley Show… Today Eff Emm!&quot;</em></strong></p>
<h3>&quot;VOTE NDJ 4&quot; to +353 85 711 4444</h3>

<p>While we were driving around Europe we decided to flick through local radio stations, and by far our favourite DJs from the whole trip were <a href="http://www.todayfm.com/Darcey">Ray D&#39;Arcy</a> and <a href="http://www.rayfoley.ie/">Ray Foley</a> from <a href="http://www.todayfm.com/">Today FM</a> in Ireland. They&#39;re banter literally became a highlight of the trip, so much so that we&#39;d often dordle in the car outside a major tourist attraction so we could finish hearing them ramble and rant on an idea before we got out.</p>
<h3>&quot;VOTE NDJ 4&quot; to +353 85 711 4444</h3>
<p>We noticed while we were there the Irish sense of humour is surprisingly close to the Aussie one… perhaps because of our common heritage of British oppression ;).</p>
