<p>The rule of thirds is way off, but I like this picture for some reason. Really like all the blue, especially those random flares at the bottom which I can&#39;t account for at all. Ghosts?</p>
<p>Also makes for an interesting contrast with my <a href="http://rubenerd.com/goodbye-singapore/">photo of Singapore</a> a few days ago.</p>
