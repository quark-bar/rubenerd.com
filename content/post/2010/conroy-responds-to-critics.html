<p>In an article ripe with brash generalisations and blatant misinformation, Senator Conroy has <a title="The Punch: Conroy: Don’t believe the myths on the ISP filter" href="http://www.thepunch.com.au/articles/dont-believe-the-myths-on-the-isp-filter/">directly attacked the critics</a> of the proposed mandatory Great Internet Filter of Australia in a posting to The Punch.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>The heading of his piece states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Conroy: Don’t believe the myths on the ISP filter</p></blockquote>
<p>You mean the myths that it won&#39;t be an electronic Edsel and not a Titanic waste of taxpayers money? And what about this gem right in the second paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Government has always maintained there is no silver bullet when it comes to cyber safety and we have never said ISP-level filtering alone would help fight child pornography or keep children safe online. </p></blockquote>
<p>Then, prey tell, what is the <strong>point</strong> senator?</p>
<p>The irony that someone would defend their moves to push Australia&#39;s online civil liberties and free speech towards PRC and North Korean territory by publishing an article online is breathtaking. I have an idea sir, I find you ramblings offensive, can I have them filtered?</p>
