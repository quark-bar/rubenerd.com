<p>A noble cause, but those billionaires could have made an infinitely more positive impact by running ethical and sustainable business that perhaps would have made less money, than robbing us and giving some of it back later. CEOs could (if they wanted to) use their influence to affect the world in positive ways; when they retire their money is no better than anyone else&#39;s.</p>
<p>This could be my late hippy mum speaking through me, but isn&#39;t it about time we stop valuing a company based on its profits and more on its impact?</p>
