<p>Yesterday <a href="//rubenerd.com/wendy-francis-family-first/">I posted</a> my open letter to Wendy Francis, a Family First senator from Queensland who made some… shall we say <em>BS</em> remarks about same sex couples in Australia. After her comments made headlines, her site admins took her story down. Fortunately <a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=cache:http://wendy4senate.com/2010/08/let%E2%80%99s-end-the-gay-marriage-debate-and-protect-children-from-abuse/&amp;emsg=NCSR&amp;ei=qbNeTLO-OMGTkAXMjszsAQ">Google Cache</a> had a copy of it.</p>

<p>I also <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/4875101108/sizes/o/in/photostream/">took a screenshot</a> which ironically is 661.6K. There&#39;s [almost] the sign of the devil, right there!</p>
<h3>&quot;Let’s end the gay marriage debate and protect children from abuse&quot;</h3>
<blockquote><p>Queensland senate candidate Wendy Francis has called on both Labor and the Coalition to draw a line in the sand and put the gay marriage debate behind them, saying the continued debate is destructive to Australia’s future.</p>
<p>“The best thing we can do for our children and their children is to send the message that marriage will always remain between a man and a women,” she said. Francis said that Australia would never recover from legalising gay marriage and those who advocate this are not thinking of the dramatic consequences.</p>
<p>“We’ll have kids growing up with no mothers or no fathers, we’ll create a parent-less generation, social problems including depression and suicide will be uncontrollable and any sense of right and wrong will be gone. Is that the Australia we want?” She asked.</p>
<p>Francis told Channel 7’s Sunrise program last week during a live debate that she would defend the current interpretation of marriage. “The homosexual community represents a tiny percentage of Australia. They have the right to be homosexual but they don’t have the right to dictate to mainstream Australia or to change the laws to suit their narrow agenda,” she said.</p>
<p>According to Francis, the gay agenda is self-centred. “Homosexuals who are pushing for this don’t care about children; they care only about their selfish desires. Children in homosexual relationships are subject to emotional abuse and legitimising gay marriage is like legalising child abuse.”</p>
<p>Francis said she is the only person who will stand up for the values that Australians care about. “The major parties are too scared to speak up for what is right. They are too politically correct.”</p>
<p>“It’s time for the voices of the people to be heard in Canberra. While the senate is dominated by the two major parties and the radical Greens, we will continue to slide down the path of moral erosion and ignore the concerns of mainstream Australia”</p></blockquote>
