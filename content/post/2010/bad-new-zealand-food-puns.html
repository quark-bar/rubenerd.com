<p>Would that be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_Wellington">beef wellington</a>? I suppose if it&#39;s in New Zealand it must be a mutton wellington right? <em>Tee</em> and as well as that <em>hee</em>!</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, I&#39;d love to <a href="http://www.wellingtononaplate.com/">visit Wellington</a>. I&#39;ve been to Auckland for an afternoon (long story) but that&#39;s it. Maybe it&#39;s just because I&#39;m hungry.</p>
