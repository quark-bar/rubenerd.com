<p>A few people on Twitter this evening reported that YouTube had been [maliciously] hacked. I clicked the first featured video on the YouTube homepage and was given a blank page that abruptly ended after a few comments containing attempted script code. Seems like a code injection attack exploiting incorrectly sanitised comments.</p>
<p>I run <a href="http://noscript.net/">NoScript</a>, so perhaps that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t see anything. If that&#39;s true, its for unexpected situations like this that I <strong>insist</strong> on running Firefox and with such an extension!</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> People are now saying it was /b/, the same mob that tried to send Justin Bieber to North Korea. They should have just left it at the latter; it was kinda funny.</p>
