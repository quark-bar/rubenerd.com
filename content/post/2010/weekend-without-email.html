<p>I don&#39;t check my email for two days, and <strong>this happens</strong>. To be fair, I had ~200 before, and probably three quarters of those are from Twitter, Gowalla, Tumblr and other made up words.</p>
<p>Basically, if you&#39;ve <strong>emailed</strong> me or <strong>@replied</strong> to me and haven&#39;t got an answer, you probably won&#39;t be getting one until my tests are over this week. Sorry :(. Wish I didn&#39;t need to sleep, think of all those wasted hours.</p>
<p>In other news, I need coffee. And some sleep. And why do people say <strong>gotten</strong> when they could just say <strong>got</strong>? Its one less syllable, and half the letters! That means its healthier. Think about it, if you eat half as much alphabet soup, you&#39;re only eating half the kJ&#39;s and processed artificial flavourings. As opposed to those organic artifical flabourings. Wait, what&#39;s a <strong>flabouring</strong>? Is that what you become if you eat too much alphabet soup?</p>
