<p>It&#39;s time to <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1316672/Election-on-a-knife-edge-Newspoll">start worrying</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Labor has lost its substantial two-party preferred lead against the coalition in just two weeks, the latest Newspoll has found. [â€¦] The poll, taken between Friday and Sunday, found Labor and the coalition are split 50-50.</p></blockquote>
<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m not a Labor fan (at least not any more), but the prospect of <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tony_Abbott">this guy</a> being our PM is absolutely terrifying. We don&#39;t need another anti-intellectial theocracy.</p>
<p>From a tech perspective I&#39;m guessing we&#39;re screwed either way, unless enough people vote below the line and oust <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/stephen-conroy/">Stephen Conroy</a>, or enough Labor ministers grow spines to stand up against the <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/openinternet/">filter</a>, or enough Greens are elected to put pressure on Labor to straighten up and fly right, or a decent combination of all three.</p>
