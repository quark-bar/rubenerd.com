<p>Singapore&#39;s getting quite a lashing this morning, so my dad and I have camped out at the O&#39;Brien&#39;s sandwich bar at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?oe=utf-8&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;q=jelita&amp;fb=1&amp;view=text&amp;ei=fvMYTLOtE8e0rAeM_K2tCg&amp;ved=0CCkQtwMwAA&amp;radius=0.66&amp;sll=1.317557,103.785846&amp;sspn=0.017119,0.015836&amp;split=1&amp;rq=1&amp;ev=zi&amp;hq=jelita&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=1.317557,103.785846&amp;spn=0.017119,0.015836&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=G">Jelita</a>. Back when my school had its campus at Ulu Pandan, I&#39;d go to Jelita all the time for Pizza Hut. Now it&#39;s an Irish sandwich shop, go figure :)</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Typical, I hit the Draft button instead of Publish, again! The timestamp for the photo was around 10am today.</p>
