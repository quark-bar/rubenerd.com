<p>I was refraining from comment about this issue for the longest time, but I&#39;m fed up and need to say something.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>My lamentations about large blog networks aside, a guy found a lost prototype iPhone in a bar, and instead of handing it into the police as Californian law stipulates or back to Apple like a good Samaritan, he goes one step further from outright stealing and sells it for $5000. When Apple demands legal action, three quarters of the internet get their knickers in a knot and say Apple is evil. Fake Steve Jobs practically wet his pants at the opportunity with six dull new posts. I&#39;ll stop with the pants analogies now.</p>

You&#39;ve always stood for exposing shoddy journalism standards, and now you&#39;re defending it?</p>
<p>Has the whole world gone insane, or has selling stolen goods all of a sudden become kosher? I&#39;m a sad panda.</p>
<p>Oh yeah and while I&#39;m at it, to all those people claiming Apple did all this on purpose to generate media hype (that history has shown they&#39;re obviously incapable of generating any other way): yes, and the moon landing was faked, Roswell was an alien crash site and on the night of a blue moon if you throw a grilled cheese sandwich into the air while chanting a disco tune it&#39;ll turn into a flying echidna.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder I&#39;ve stopped taking most tech journalism (and most other journalism for that matter) seriously any more? I know I&#39;ve already said this, but I&#39;m a sad panda.</p>
