<p>Once upon a time there was a guy who wasn&#39;t terribly exciting or witty, so when something as silly as a nice round even number appeared as his blog post count, he had to tell everyone. In his best Austin Powers voice: <strong>post #2700 bay-bee!</strong></p>
<p>Before you complain, at least this post had more substance than my <a title="Post: The world has come to an end!" href="//rubenerd.com/youtube-down/">previous post</a> from this evening. Which makes no sense, because that post was chronicling the end of the world; if anything <strong>it</strong> should have had more detail. I&#39;m going to bed.</p>
