<p>I promise this will be my last iPad post, at least for a long time. In fact with this problem, it might not even be a self-imposed restriction :P.</p>

<p>From reading the reviews flooding in so far, the response has been almost universally positive. I think <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=9561377#post9561377">dante@sisna.com</a> on the MacRumours forums put it the most eloquently:</p>
<blockquote><p>You have to leave the desk with one &#8212; sit on the sofa with it &#8212; to really grasp how it will begin to change lifestyles.</p>
<p>So much more enjoyable than a laptop/netbook.</p>
<p>It just changes the whole experience. I am hooked.</p>
<p>Going to have a hard time producing client content today &#8212; I want to CONSUME it.</p>
<p>The YouTube iPad interface is beautiful</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll reserve my own judgement until I use one for myself, but if this is true it shows once for all technical specifications have little to no bearing on usability after all. Waah, the iPad doesn&#39;t have feature X and a netbook does! Yes, and what&#39;s your point?</p>
<p>Unfortunately my own worst fear about it has been confirmed. From the first post in the aformentioned MacRumors forum thread:</p>
<blockquote><p>The screen is bright and crisp with wide viewing angles. Despite the oleophobic coating, it collects and shows fingerprints more than expected.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Well bother</h3>
<p>Not only do I inherit my dad&#39;s inability to devise and deliver good jokes, I also suffer from constantly sweaty hands, the medical term is <a href="http://www.curesweatypalms.com/Hyperhidrosis_Palmar.htm">palmer hyperhidrosis</a>. It&#39;s perhaps my biggest handicap as a software developer and blogger, if I don&#39;t have a keyboard cover and replace it every couple of months I destroy computer hardware. It also means I don&#39;t shake people&#39;s hands and I can&#39;t walk along holding hands with a girl, which makes me even more socially awkward and shy than I would otherwise be. Anyway, you get the idea :(.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, having a touch screen phone has been a godsend because a flat surface is much easier to wipe clean than a tiny, complicated keyboard, but given I&#39;d be reading books on an iPad I worry having my greasy pawprints over the screen would get really irritating. A small iPhone screen (or a Nexus One screen, or a Palm Pre screenâ€¦) is easy to wipe clean, but would it scale to something as big as an iPad?</p>
<p>I suppose for now I&#39;ll have to keep using smaller sub-notebooks with keyboard covers, until Apple develops a super high tech self cleaning screen that&#39;s even better than what they currently have.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a joke about absorbency and the product&#39;s name, but that&#39;s below the tone and standards of this blog. Heh, iPad.</p>
