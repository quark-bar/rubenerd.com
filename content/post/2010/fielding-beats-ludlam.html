<p>I just read <a href="http://www.somebodythinkofthechildren.com/fielding-beats-ludlam-cyber-safetey-committee/">this report</a> on Somebody Think of the Children having just seen it commented on by <a href="http://gdayworld.thepodcastnetwork.com/">Cameron Reilly</a> on Twitter and shared by <a href="http://maxious.lambdacomplex.org/">Alex</a> in Google Reader. I&#39;m speechless. Game over man, game over.</p>

<blockquote><p>A ballot was held in the upper house on Tuesday to decide which minor party or independent senator would be appointed to a federal parliamentary committee on cyber-safety.</p>
<p>In a very close secret vote, Senator Fielding was awarded the job with 34 votes to Senator Ludlamâ€™s 32.</p></blockquote>

<p>Any already fleeting ideas that this would be a productive and useful committee have not only been shot down, but shoved into a rocket and hurled into the centre of the sun.</p>
<p>And to think this morning <a href="//rubenerd.com/combination-lock-usb/">I was worrying</a> about novelty gadgets being sold as ultra secure devices to people who don&#39;t know. If I had a graph showing my view on humanity, it would have taken a nosedive today.</p>
