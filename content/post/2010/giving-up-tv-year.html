<p>For those of you who didn&#39;t read my tweets from earlier this year, on new year&#39;s day I vowed to not watch television for an entire year. It turns out to have been far simpler than I thought it would be :).</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>Of course, notice my phrasing, I didn&#39;t say &quot;television shows&quot; I said &quot;television&quot;. The idea of waiting around for someone else&#39;s schedule to watch programming has seemed weird and foreign to me for many years, here I&#39;m just taking it a step further. My iPhone and laptops are my televisions now. No TV tuner though, all of it is from internet sources.</p>
<h3>Iâ€™m a bit less angry now</h3>
<p>The first thing I noticed was I&#39;m less angry in the evenings. I have an insatiable appetite for news, it&#39;s why I unsubscribed to a bunch of wire services on Google Reader and later retired it for Twitter. I hate being kept out of the loop. If someone took away my internet access today, news would absolutely be the number 1 thing I would miss.</p>
<p>As I&#39;m sure is the case in many places, the news on commercial television in Australia is terrible. Even if there was a major humanitarian disaster somewhere or a new scientific discovery, almost without question the first 10 minutes are about mundane local affairs, followed by a token amount for business, then the rest is entirely dedicated to painfully detailed sport analysis. I admit I find the whole idea of most sports to be terribly dull, pointless and uninteresting, but in Adelaide they have to analyse AFL, a primitive contact sport nobody else in the world even plays.</p>
<p>Then don&#39;t get me started on the tabloid news programmes. A Current Affair and Today Tonight represent the absolute dregs of media reporting in Australia, but often they would have at least one story I&#39;d be marginally interested in so I&#39;d find myself watching them. ACA and TT are like poisons, there&#39;s no safe dosage.</p>
<p>I cut these shows entirely out of my diet, and I&#39;m a happier person.</p>
<h3>Not limited to time and place</h3>
<p>Less than five years ago if you didn&#39;t watch television you were pretty limited online, but thesedays with podcasting and legal media downloads (cough) I&#39;m spoilt for choice. Not only that, but I can choose where and when I watch media, for example I&#39;ve made it a habit of watching Media Watch on Tuesday mornings on the train. It&#39;s a ton of fun :).</p>
<p>At some point I&#39;ll write up all the video shows I download. It&#39;s as if I have my own personal television network!</p>
