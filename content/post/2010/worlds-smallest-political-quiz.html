<p>I&#39;ve done a similar test to this <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p3603/">back in 2008</a>, but I always like to compare my results. In fact I may have done this one before too now that I <a href="http://www.theadvocates.org/quizp/index.html">look at the title</a>!</p>

<p>Anyway I&#39;m listed as a liberal-libertarian, which is about right. I admire the libertarian view that people have the right to self determination, but I also believe health and education are fundamental human rights not privileges offered only to those who can afford the extravagant premiums and school fees asked for by a free market. Those who think a free market can offer everything as deluded as communists who think governments can provide everything.</p>
<p>Of course I&#39;m in my 20s now, perhaps a few decades from now I&#39;ll be different. Heck, when I was 10 I thought a libertarian was someone who worked with lots of books.</p>
