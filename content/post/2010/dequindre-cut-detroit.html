<p>I&#39;m taking a break from <a href="//rubenerd.com/anime-kallen-cupcake/">anime backgrounds</a> for a while (stop the presses!) for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dequindre_Cut_Detroit_a.JPG">this photo</a> taken of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dequindre_Cut">Dequindre Cut in Detroit</a> of all places!</p>

<blockquote><p>The Dequindre Cut is a below-grade pathway, formerly a Grand Trunk Western Railroad line located on the east side of Detroit, Michigan just west of St. Aubin Street. Much of the Cut has been converted to a greenway; the colorful graffiti along the pathway has been left in place.</p></blockquote>
<p>I found it while doing research on the automotive industry, and I was spellbound by it for some deeply weird reason. Maybe it&#39;s the forced perspective, or the colours, or the way the concrete frames the monitor around the edges, or something. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m not a visual designer or a pro photographer.</p>
<p>Credit goes to Andrew Jameson, if he had a link on the photo page for me to plug, I&#39;d put it here.</p>
