<p>It seems all I had to do was mention Fedora a few times and I started getting technical support emails :). I&#39;m still more of a FreeBSD guy, but I hope these help.</p>

<h3>Problem 1: No GCC Installed</h3>
<pre>configure: error:no acceptable C compiler found in $PATH</pre>
<p>This happens if you&#39;re attempting to build a C application and you don&#39;t have the GNU Compiler Collection installed. Most likely this was because you installed Fedora using the Live CD which (I think, feel free to correct me) doesn&#39;t have it, but it&#39;s easy enough to install:</p>
<pre># yum install gcc</pre>
<h3>Problem 2: No GCC-C++ installed</h3>
<pre>configure: error:installation or configuration problemC++ compiler cannot create executables.</pre>
<p>Similar problem as above:</p>
<pre># yum install gcc-c++</pre>
<h3>Problem 3: No grilled cheese sandwiches</h3>
<p>The solution:</p>
<pre>% echo Grilled cheese sandwiches</pre>
