<blockquote><p><cite><a href="http://twitter.com/greenbes/status/13136044037">Soylent Greenbes:</a></cite> You are not Facebookâ€™s customer. You are the product that they sell to their real customers &#8212; advertisers. Forget this at your peril.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, forgetting still doesn&#39;t give you the ability to permanently delete your account and have Facebook forget you. Which is a shame because in Soviet Russia, Facebook forgets you.</p>
