<p>On Tuesday I announced on Twitter that I&#39;d booked a seat for Steve Ballmer&#39;s talk at Marina Sands celebrating <a href="http://www.crystalevents.info/imaginecupawardsceremony.htm">20 years of Microsoft in Singapore</a>. At least, I <strong>thought</strong> I did until I got this message:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Due to overwhelming demand, we are unable to offer you a seat (-6).
</p></blockquote>

<p>Have no idea what that -6 is. Does it mean I missed out by six places? Or does it have something to do with 666 or another superstitious number thingy?</p>
<p>I&#39;m bitterly disappointed, but I&#39;ll survive. I thought the talk and Q&amp;A would be an interesting counterpoint to <a href="//rubenerd.com/cloudsourcesg/">CloudForceSG</a> which I watched on Tuesday, even if I probably would have disagreed with most of what was said. Hey, you&#39;re supposed to keep your friends close and your enemies closer, right?</p>
<p>I was going to ask him how he thought Microsoft was going to stay relevant in the consumer space this decade, and to sign my <a href="//rubenerd.com/windows-3-turning-20/">Windows 3.0 software carton</a>! I suppose they got wind that I was a Mac, free/open source software and standards guy. Sneaky.</p>
