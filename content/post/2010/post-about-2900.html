<p>I’m not a superstitious person, but today a series of events unfolded that combined are not worthy of a blog post on a tech-ish site tlike this, but they mildly freaked me out enough that I&#39;ll be talking about them anyway.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m written almost 2900 Rubénerd blog posts</li>
<li>I have 2900 unread messages in Gmail</li>
<li>I wrote a draft whitepaper on the Cisco 2900 router (nice kit)</li>
<li>… and a fun report on the retro ICL 2900 mainframe</li>
<li>My latest grocery bill from Woolworths was exactly $29.00</li>
<li>My latest development effort is just shy of 2900 lines of code</li>
</ul>
<p>For those of you not part of <a href="http://onsug.com/">The Overnightscape Underground</a> universe, <a href="http://twitter.com/FrankNora">Frank Edward Nora</a> has long had an obsession with the number 209, which mathematically is the same integer as 2900 rearranged as 0290.</p>
