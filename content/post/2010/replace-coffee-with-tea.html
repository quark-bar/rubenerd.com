<p>With my chronic sleeping problems, I&#39;ve decided to try cutting back on coffee and replace it with tea. Ritsu is SHOCKED! And Mugi is… hold on, I&#39;m distracted again.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>Much like a smoker who has oral fixation after quitting, I realised as much as I need the bean it&#39;s the experience of having a steaming hot beverage while I&#39;m programming or doing other work that I miss when I&#39;m not having coffee, so tea is a really good analog. Except I program computers which are digital.</p>
<p>I&#39;m the only one in the family who likes it, but I love Earl Grey tea. I&#39;d make Jean Luc Picard proud, and disappoint Janeway ;). English Breakfast, Chai and Green are my other favourites, depending on my mood and the time of day. While we were in Ireland I also became quite partial to Irish Breakfast, but the supermarkets here don&#39;t stock it.</p>
<p>Twinings is the staple around here (cue Bakemonogatari reference), but Dilmah makes a mean green tea. I had some Oxfam English Breakfast from Australia which made me feel all warm and fuzzy, but I&#39;m not sure if they have shops here.</p>

<h3>The backstory you don’t care about</h3>
<p>For those who aren&#39;t bored of the story already, back when I was in school my mum would often have chemotherapy early in the morning so we weren&#39;t in the oncology ward during the busy hours of the day. To the frustration of Ms Sameuls, my high school year coordinator who called me a &quot;part time student&quot; on several occasions behind my back, I would <strong>always</strong> go with her to the hospital to keep her company, even if it meant skipping morning classes or taking whole days off when she&#39;d have to go to the ICU which occured more frequently as the years went by.</p>
<p>Because it was so early in the morning, we got into the habit of having me go upstars to Delifrance to buy takeaway coffee and &quot;medicial cakey substances&quot;, to use her lingo. She was the most epically awesome person, so of course The God(s) had to take her out while keeping people like Bush alive. Karma is bunk.</p>
<p>Anyway getting back on track, I got into the habit of having one cup, then two, then three to stay awake in those early hours, and eventially it became a dependency. I was up to seven a day a few years ago (which ironically helped my abnormally low blood pressure!), but I&#39;ve since cut back to four. It&#39;s my hope by drinking more tea to have that down to two or three a day. Here&#39;s hoping I can pull it off!</p>

<h3>You know what would help?</h3>
<p>If Mugi and Jean Luc Picard (or Mugi&#39;s seiyuu and Patrick Stewart!) came over to help me drink more tea. I&#39;d ask Yui to serve it, but she&#39;d probally spill it everywhere. Or Mikuru, that works :).</p>
