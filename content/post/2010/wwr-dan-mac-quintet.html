<p>I haven&#39;t featured a <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/">Whole Wheat Radio</a> artist for a few weeks, so here&#39;s my favourite for today! From <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Artists:The_Dan_Mac_Quintet">their WWR artist page</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Artists:The_Dan_Mac_Quintet"><p>Dan McElrath is a graduate of the Furman University School of Music. He has performed for the past 30 years in venues across America covering a wide range of musical styles from gospel to contemporary jazz. Recently The Dan Mac Quintet has recorded CD’s with vocalist Katie Strock (DanKa-2008), Vonnie Kaufman (So Nice-2008) and Cat Coward (Out of the Bag-2007) all of which can be found on iTunes. The band has just completed its first all original instrumental jazz CD of Alaskan themed jazz entitled &quot;Ajazzkaâ&quot;. </p></blockquote>
<p>I heard my <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Songs:Furry_Bached_Lisa_%28149543%29">first song of theirs</a> a few days ago. It started as a classical rendition of Beethoven&#39;s <em>Für Elise</em>, only to morph into an upbeat jazzy tune of epic awesomeness. I&#39;m using all the technical music jargen, you see.</p>
<p>Unfortunately they&#39;re not on CDBaby which; if you&#39;ll pardon the crappy pun; is a crying shame.</p>
