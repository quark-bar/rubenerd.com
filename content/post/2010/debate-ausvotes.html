<p>For a brief period of time this evening, Australia watched Julia Gillard and Tony Abbott debate over who would best serve the country as PM by dodging questions, not proposing constructive steps towards any environmental action and expelling much hot air about boat people in a way Pauline Hanson would be proud. Third party candidates like <a href="http://www.greens.org.au/">Bob Brown</a> or <a href="http://www.sexparty.org.au/">Fiona Patten</a> who would have made the debate interesting (or even just useful) were not invited.</p>
<p>I watched by proxy through Twitter. Donâ€™t think I missed much.</p>
