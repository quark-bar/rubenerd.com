<p>According to the Federal Court of Australia registry website for tomorrow, the ACCC versus SingTel Optus case has advanced to a directions hearing… whatever that is.</p>

<h3>The quote is the quotey quote quotey quotey</h3>
<blockquote><p>9:30 AM Directions</p>
<p>3 (P)NSD776/2010 BRIDGETTE REBECCA STYLES v CLAYTON UTZ</p>
<p>4 (P)NSD1157/2010 AUSTRALIAN COMPETITION &#038; CONSUMER COMMISSION v SINGTEL OPTUS PTY LIMITED</p>
<p>5 (P)NSD1343/2009 RODMAC HOLDINGS PTY LTD &#038; ANOR v ROTRIC HOLDINGS PTY LTD &#038; ORS</p></blockquote>
<h3>Come again?</h3>
<p>According to the Glossary of the Legal Services Commision of Rigel 7 website, a so called directions hearing is:</p>
<blockquote><p>A hearing of directions</p></blockquote>
<p>While arguably accurate, this description is entirely pointless. According to the far more useful Glossary of the Legal Services Commision of South Australia website, a directions hearing is:</p>
<blockquote><p>[…] held before the full hearing so that the court or tribunal can give directions to the parties about how the action should proceed.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, have we made any progress determining whether or not Optus intentionally mislead consumers with their unlimited advertising that I spoke tongue in cheek about last week?</p>
<h3>Link arms, don’t make them</h3>
