<p>Dear CNET, I <strong>provided my location</strong> in my account profile with you, please don&#39;t send me spam that doesn&#39;t even relate to me. Sincerely, Ruben in Singapore and Australia.</p>
<p>This sort of thing happens to me all the time, and not just from CNET. How hard would it be to check a user&#39;s provided country before sending them offers and competitions they&#39;re not eligible for? One or two extra lines of code?</p>
