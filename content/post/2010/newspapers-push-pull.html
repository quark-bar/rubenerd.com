<p>While waiting for my flight, I decided to skim the <em>Adelaide Advertiser</em> for something to do. The landslides in Rio warranted two columns, the Medvedev Obama nuclear weapons treaty â€Žwarranted one. By comparison, a detailed analysis of the size of AFL footballs took up an entire page, complete with a gigantic colour photograph.</p>
<p>I know the <em>&#39;tiser</em> isn&#39;t exactly the most reputable paper out there, but perhaps newspapers should be whinging less about the internet stealing their eyeballs and instead look at the quality of their own journalism, both push and pull factors are going on here. And Murdoch wants me to pay for such &quot;journalism&quot;?</p>
