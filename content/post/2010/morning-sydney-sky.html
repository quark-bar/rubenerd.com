<p>The contrast, colour and details on the buildings are terrible, but adjusting the RAW and exporting like this was the only way I could hope to match the colour of the sky out the window this morning. I reckon the real thing was even deeper and bluer than this!</p>
<p>I tell you what, I prefer the climate in Singapore, but nowhere on earth has better skies than Australia :). Except maybe Ireland earlier this year, they had epic skies when we weren&#39;t trapped in a snowbank for long enough to see it.</p>
