<p>This is a fantastic idea, Apple is now letting people buy iPhone apps and give them to other people as gifts!</p>

<p>I can absolutely see myself doing this for other people. My dad is buying an iPod Touch next month so I could buy him one of his motorbike magazines as an iPhone app as a present :). The potential marketing value this represents is huge. I mean, the marketing value of the concept, not the fact I&#39;d be buying my dad a motorbike magazine iPhone app.</p>

<p>I just bought a copy of the <a title="The Büno Destruct Designer app page on Apple.com" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id357169703?mt=8">Büno Destruct Designer</a> for my sister because I&#39;m obsessing over it right now and I&#39;m such a nice brother :). Her response was <em>&quot;what the hell is this in my inbox?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Anyone want to buy me the $50 Wolfram Alpha app?</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>Good grief, you do a <a title="Google search for Büno Destruct Designer" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Büno+Destruct+Designer">Google Search</a> for Büno Destruct Designer on Google and my blog is the first result! No doubt because I didn&#39;t spell it properly, it&#39;s actually the Büru Destruct Designer. Whoops!</p>
