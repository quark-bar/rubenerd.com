<p>It&#39;s so rare for me these days to have an excellent customer support experience that when it does happen I feel compelled to tell as many people about it as possible.</p>

When I took it home to try out in my Libretto I realised it was unsupported (Librettos only take 16bit cards) so I took it back this afternoon and with the simplest of explanations got a complete refund.</p>
<p>I&#39;m aware Dick Smith&#39;s has a 14 day &quot;change your mind&quot; policy, but to be given the refund with a smile and no lengthy forms or BS was amazing. Kudos.</p>
<p>Now just change your logo back to the old one :).</p>
