<p>As with my beloved FreeBSD, Fedora has a <code>/etc/fstab</code> file that lists partitions to be automatically mounted on boot, but with one important difference: Fedora defaults to using a partition’s UUID and not its label.</p>

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I was all ready to pose a question in a newsgroup myself, but fortunately Bill Nottingham from <a href="http://old.nabble.com/Why-does-fstab-use-partition-UUIDs-vice-partition-labels-in-F9-beta--td16310452.html">this old thread</a> from the Fedora 9 days put it simply:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://old.nabble.com/Why-does-fstab-use-partition-UUIDs-vice-partition-labels-in-F9-beta--td16310452.html">
<p>UUIDs are unique. (In theory, anyway.) Labels aren’t.</p>
<p>Bill</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough, I suppose you could have unintentionally labelled two of your drives the same thing. I never have because I like to use unique labels that match their mountpoints to keep things simple, but I suppose if Sarah Palin or Stephen Conroy ever installed Linux they’d probably try a stunt like that.</p>
<p>Anyway so it seemed if I wanted my brand new formatted drive to be mounted when Fedora booted, I needed to find out what the new drive’s partition UUID was instead of just using the label I’d just assigned to it.</p>
<h3>How do I find out a partition’s UUID?</h3>
<p>Good question. A cursory Google search returned <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/3132/how-do-i-find-the-uuid-of-a-partition">this page from ServerFault</a> which lists a dizzying array of options with plenty of justifications. blkid worked for me:</p>
<pre>
# blkid /dev/sda<br />
&gt; LABEL="moe" UUID="#-#-#-#-#" TYPE="ext4"</p>
<p>If this doesn't work, you may not have <code>/sbin</code> in your <code>$PATH</code>. In that case, just run it from that folder, no worries.</p>
<p>Once you've got the UUID, you can finally add it to <code>/etc/fstab/</code> along with the file system and mountpoint.</p>
<p>I still can't say I'm a fan, but I suppose that's the way things are going.</p>
