<p>Beware the <a href="http://scripting.com/">wrath of Dave</a>, poke fun at his netbook and he&#39;ll just crassly assume you&#39;re a spineless puppet of Apple folk because they&#39;re naturally the only ones who are uninspired by flimsy designs. I resemble [sic] his remarks… for one thing not all Apple fans are boys ;).</p>

<a href="http://twitter.com/davewiner/status/10372773832">DaveWiner:</a> People who say the Asus isn’t pretty &#8212; balderdash. People are always commenting on the cute little computer. It’s like a Prius.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd/status/10372868389">Rubenerd:</a> Sorry @davewiner, but that Asus really is an ugly machine. That’s not to say it isn’t convenient or useful though.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/davewiner/status/10372928981">DaveWiner:</a> @Rubenerd &#8212; you ever actually used one or are you just parroting what the apple fanboys told you to say

<p>What was it that Adam West said on The Simpsons? I don&#39;t need moulded plastic to improve my physique… pure… West! If I had a point for this post, I&#39;ve forgotten what it was.</p>
<p>As I <a href="http://rubenerd.com/dave-winer-versus-rainer-schade/">pointed out</a> back in 2006, in that above photo Dave looks just like my dad. Turns out they actually look nothing alike at all.</p>
