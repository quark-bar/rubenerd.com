<blockquote><p>One score and nine years ago, our father Reagan brought forth, on the North American continent, a new nation, conceived in the idea that greed is good and taxes are bad, that government is the enemy , and dedicated to the proposition that rich men are more equal than “others.” ~ <a href="http://freakoutnation.com/2010/12/11/senator-bernie-sanders-filibuster-fires-up-the-left/#comment-8280">James K Weston</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps a slight oversimplification, but I still liked it. The quote I mean, not the actions. Something about Thatcherism would have been good to include too.</p>
<p>My 24th year on this spinning lump of rock was a real watershed: my dissolution with politicians finally eclipsed my optimism. It doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m a pessimist, perhaps more a realist.</p>
