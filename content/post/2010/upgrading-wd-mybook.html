<p>When I first bought this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Digital_My_Book#Studio_Edition">Western Digital MyBook</a> back in 2008 I thought 1TB was so gigantically massive as to be practically infinite, but here I am in 2010 with four of them and they&#39;re almost all full to bursting. Because I travel and study abroad I need external drives, and I spent extra money to have FireWire versions, so I decided to swap out the 1TB drive from one of the enclosures and fit in a 1.5TB instead of buying another separate unit.</p>
<p>Thanks to some <a href="http://carltonbale.com/western-digital-my-book-opening-the-case-removing-the-drive">detailed instructions from Carlton Bale</a>  it didn&#39;t take too long and am now in the process of moving all my stuff over to the new drive. Wonder how long this one will last?</p>
