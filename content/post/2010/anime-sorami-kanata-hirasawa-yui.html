<p>I <strong>really</strong> need to spin these anime posts off into a separate blog again.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>There&#39;s some debate that not only Sorami Kanata and Hirasawa Yui are the same character but they&#39;re comparable in awesomeness.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to get into trouble from the increasingly vocal anti-moe taskforce for saying this, but while I enjoyed the few So-Ra-No-Wo-To episodes I saw and while I do think the trumpet is an awesome instrument (especially if used in jazz), Yui is still the Queen. I&#39;m rightâ€¦ <strong>right?</strong></p>
