<p>One of the world&#39;s best dressed and most friendly scientists, Dr Karl <a title="Dr Karl answering a question on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/DoctorKarl/status/11579560300">answered</a> a question about muscle exhaustion.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/DoctorKarl/status/11579560300"><p>Why do arm muscles get tired? @maxiewawa Mmm. Ca++ exhaustion, glucose exhaustion, lactic acid overload, neurotransmitter exhaustion, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can relate, whenever I write C++ code I get severe muscle exhaustion in my fingers and brain ;-).</p>
<p>By contrast, Java shifts some of that mental exhaustion from the brain to the fingers WithItsExcessiveCamelCaseMethods. I think wrapper methods saved me from serious finger ligament damage and carpel tunnel syndrome.</p>
<p>This post that I constructed entirely out of an intentionally misread quote was brought to you by a Grilled Cheese Sandwich.</p>
