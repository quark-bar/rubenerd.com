<p>Taken straight from the camera without any editing. Usually the sky around here fills with fairly uniform clouds, but this morning there were so many layers with light piercing the thinner bands, the detail and colours were amazing. Earlwood, inner west Sydney. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/5109794366/">Full sized image on Flickr</a>.</p>
