<p>After using it as my primary editor for several weeks, I feel as though I can finally graduate from nvi. It was more challenging than I thought it would be when I <a title="Post: Trying out the nvi editor" href="//rubenerd.com/trying-nvi/">first decided to learn it</a>, but it was a fantastic learning experience.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>While I&#39;ve been using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi" title="Wikipedia article on vi">vi</a> clone in the form of <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="The Vim Editor homepage">Vim</a> for years, I admit I&#39;ve always cheated by adding the <code>nocompatible</code> option in <a href="http://rubenschade.com/dotfiles/vimrc" title="my vim resource file">my vimrc file</a>. This has the effect of making Vim behave more like a contemporary editor which lowered the barrier to entry, but it meant when I started using nvi I was lost and frustrated in a sea of escape keys!</p>
<p>Everyone likes a silly car analogy, so here goes. I like to think I learned how to drive vi editors by using an automatic (Vim with nocompatible), so when I had to use a manual (nvi) I understood most of it but there was a whole new set of interfaces I had to learn. The upshot of putting in this effort though is now I can drive both, and perhaps I can even drive Vim more effectively.</p>
<p>I can now confidently say if I&#39;m ever thrown in front of a FreeBSD machine I myself don&#39;t maintain, I&#39;ll be able to use nvi in place of Vim with a minimum of muss and fuss. Well technically I could use ee, but where would the fun be in that? :)</p>
