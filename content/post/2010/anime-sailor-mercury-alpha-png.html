<p>Both my other posts today were <a href="//rubenerd.com/trevor-grace-leaflet/">serious</a> and <a href="//rubenerd.com/eight-goals-2010/">drawn out</a>, so I needed something fun and pointless ^_^. Ah how art styles have changed…</p>
<p>For what it&#39;s worth, making a graphic work well with transparent backgrounds is surprisingly difficult. Mac applications get away with it by using shadows with gradual alpha transparency on their high resolution icons. The graphic of Ami, sorry Sailor Mercury (don&#39;t worry your secret identity is safe with me!) only works on white, which come to think of it defeats the purpose of having it transparent, doesn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>The last time I posted a pointless transparent graphic post <a href="//rubenerd.com/p2718/">was in 2008</a>. I had such a crush on the seiyū for Ami in the anime when I was growing up, but I still think that other post was funnier, even if it was just as pointless.</p>
