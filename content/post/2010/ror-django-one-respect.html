<p>Having used both, while I do prefer <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> for my own projects, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> has a fancier welcome page. Sorry, it had to be said :D.</p>
<p>If they were really smart they&#39;d include a <a href="http://images.google.com.au/images?q=Django%20Reinhardt">picture</a> of Reinhardt the Awesome and some wicked jazz music, plenty of both to choose from! It&#39;d probably <strong>quadruple</strong> the size of the framework tarball, but to borrow a phrase from my sister <em>&quot;it&#39;d be SO worth it!&quot;</em> Am I right? Don&#39;t answer that.</p>
