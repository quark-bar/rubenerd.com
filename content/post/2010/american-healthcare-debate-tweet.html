<p>I know we&#39;re all bored to tears with American healthcare reform analysis, but someone against the bill <a title="Tweet by DamnTrue on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/DamnTrue/status/11023527086">tweeted me</a> this afternoon with a message I think summaries the debate pretty damn well.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/DamnTrue/status/11023527086"><p>@Rubenerd: Question is do you think that people should have a right to that which they do not earn?</p></blockquote>
<p>Do you think people &quot;earned&quot; cancer and subsequent medical-related bankruptcies? Do you think human dignity, love and compassion are financially negotiable?</p>
<p>Phrasing healthcare as something that has to be &quot;earned&quot; sure doesn&#39;t sound like freedom to me. What about the freedom to be with your loved ones? The freedom to live without pain and suffering? The freedom to not live in fear?</p>
<p>Then again I suppose I&#39;m one of those &quot;super evil socialists&quot; the likes of Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck warn you all about with blackboards and books they didn&#39;t write.</p>
<h3>Pardon the Frenchâ€¦</h3>
<p>My family was <strong>damned fucking lucky</strong> to have excellent medical insurance to pay for my mum&#39;s 12 years of cancer treatment. If we couldn&#39;t afford it and we lived in the US, she would have died half of my lifetime ago, and I probably wouldn&#39;t remember her. That&#39;d be okay though, because that means taxes are a bit lower.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;ve got a lump in my throat for some reason.</p>
