<p>Time to <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/29/2968192.htm">celebrate</a> this evening? Some on Twitter seem to be already.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/07/29/2968192.htm"><p>Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan has suggested changes could be made to the Federal Government’s proposed internet filter. &#8220;Stephen Conroy… has announced some changes to the filter &#8211; he’s talking to industry about those now,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I won&#39;t be. I&#39;m with Greens Senator Ludlam on this, Labor hasn&#39;t said they&#39;re scrapping it, they&#39;ve just made vague references to &quot;changing&quot; it, whatever that means. We don&#39;t want a reworking, we want a thorough repudiation. Keep the corks in the bottles, folks. :(</p>
