<p>It got up to 3.12MB/s a few minutes ago, but my screenshot reflexes weren&#39;t fast enough. Screenshot Reflexes sounds like a terrible spaghetti western.</p>
<p>Anyway the point is we don&#39;t even have one of those expensive, super duper, ultra high speed connections here. More importantly what we do download doesn&#39;t get counted towards a stupid monthly internet quota! Without download caps, the whole internet experience changes. There&#39;s no bean counting. You don&#39;t have to toss up whether to get that latest Cranky Geeks or skimp on getting just the CD release of a distro instead of a DVD.</p>
<p>It&#39;s sad the likes of Comcast are starting to adopt this Aussie approach to the net. Say goodbye to online video streaming.</p>
