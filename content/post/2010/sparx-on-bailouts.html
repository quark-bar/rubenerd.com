<blockquote><p><strong>Ruben asks:</strong> Cynical responses aside, why didn’t the American government pay the mortgages of people so they could keep their homes with that $700 billion? Then the banks would have got their money too. It would have helped PEOPLE. I did economics classes for years, but I still don’t get this.</p>
<p><strong>Sparx replies:</strong> In a word, corruption.</p></blockquote>
