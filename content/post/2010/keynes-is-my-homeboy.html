<p>My economics teacher in high school tried to teach us that deregulation was the answer to everything, so to rebel in my own way I printed a landscape A4 picture like the one above on my economics folder. Now that I&#39;m all pumped about him again since reading <a href="http://www.johnperkins.org/">Hoodwinked</a> on Audible, I felt the need to recreate it and blog it here. <strong>Keynes is my Homeboy!</strong> Take <strong>that</strong> Milton Friedman!</p>
<p>I never did ring my economics teacher to ask him how all his massive deregulation predictions were working out for him recently. :P</p>
