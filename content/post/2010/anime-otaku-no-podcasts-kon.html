<p>From the <strong>Bureau of Ruben Has Been Blogging Too Much About K-On</strong> we have this poll by the <a href="http://otakunopodcast.com/">Otaku no Podcast</a> folks over who people&#39;s <a href="http://otakunopodcast.com/2010/09/28/poll-who-is-your-favorite-k-on-character/">favourite characters</a> are.</p>
<p>The results are encouraging, it seems I&#39;m the only one who has voted for Mugi-chan, which means she&#39;s mine by default :3! Of course I&#39;m also dismayed at the same time, as this implies she didn&#39;t receive any votes before I came along, when the others did! Fight Mugi, fight!</p>
