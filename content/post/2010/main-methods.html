<p>I&#39;ve decided to put my <a title="Post: Launching my code snippet site… maybe…" href="//rubenerd.com/launching-code-snippet-site/">code snippets blog idea</a> on hold because I don&#39;t have time to be maintaining a separate blog right now. Had I started it, this would have gone there.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>Not having <code>main</code> methods never used to worry me, but since studying Java again I <strong>really like</strong> being able to have an application kick into action without having to create an instance of it manually.</p>
<p>To illustrate what I mean, here&#39;s a crappy Java application that I merely have to execute from the command line for it to display Bender&#39;s favourite words.</p>
<pre>
<strong>MainInJava.java</strong>:
public class MainInJava
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    System.out.println("Kiss my shiny metal arse");
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Now here are roughly equivalent applications written in Ruby (my formerly favourite scripting language) and Python (my formerly favourite scripting language, and now my favourite scripting language again!):</p>
<pre>
<strong>MainInRuby.rb:</strong>
#!/usr/bin/env ruby -w

class MainInRuby
  def initialize()
    puts("Hello, world!")
  end
end

<strong>MainInPython.py:</strong>
#!/usr/bin/env python -3t

class MainInPython:
    def __main__(self):
        print("Hello, world!")
</pre>
<p>If you were to run either of these example applications, <strong>nothing</strong> would happen. The initialize and <strong>main</strong> methods aren&#39;t run because merely running the application doesn&#39;t do any instantiation. Ruby and Python expect you to create and run an instance of the application in the source.</p>
<p>The proposed workarounds if you really want Java-ish main method equivalents in these languages are to write these lines of boilerplate outside the class.</p>
<pre>
<strong>MainInRuby.rb:</strong>
if __FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME
  # Put "main" code here
end

<strong>MainInPython.py:</strong>
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</pre>
<p>I understand what these functions do, but for scripting languages that pride themselves on making life easier compared to heavy languages like Java, these don&#39;t seem all that intuitive or elegant.</p>
<p>I suppose one could argue that I&#39;ve been corrupted into thinking I need a main method and that I haven&#39;t bothered to learn the Ruby or Python way of doing things. They may be onto something ^_^.</p>
<pre>__EXIT__</pre>
