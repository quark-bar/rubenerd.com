<p>The Aussie Prime Minister Kevin Rudd met with the state premiers this morning; allegedly the response <a href="http://twitter.com/Emma_Rodgers/status/9903208760">was mixed</a>. I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s in part because one of them said something this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kevin, I’m copping so much heat and ridicule for being a member of the political party that wants to implement this misguided Great Firewall of Australia, could you please tell Senator Conroy to stop!? Please!? You’re killing me mate! *whimper*</p></blockquote>
<p>Hey, we can only hope, right? :(</p>
