<p><a href="http://segpub.net/">SegPub</a> really outdid themselves this evening; my sites were (and still are) on average taking <strong>six minutes to load</strong>, and that was only when their domains decided to resolve at all.</p>
<p><strong>I give up SegPub, I&#39;m moving.</strong> You don&#39;t answer your support tickets, messages I send to your mailing lists are rejected and your service is getting laughably bad. My GeoCities page on dialup was faster.</p>
<p>I&#39;m just glad I don&#39;t have any assignments for the next few weeks. SegPub have already cost me one high distinction when a demo site failed to load and I was failed for that part of it. Thanks guys :(</p>
