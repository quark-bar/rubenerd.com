<p>I like it! Credit to <a href="http://twitter.com/tlw3/">Tom</a> on Twitter, the image is from his Twitter page background.</p>
<p>Not doing physics in high school still remains one of my biggest regrets; I couldn&#39;t do it because the timetable clashed with two of my computer subjects. Chemistry was deeply interesting, but physics is on an entirely different plane of fascination for me. There is so much stunning beauty in physics.</p>
