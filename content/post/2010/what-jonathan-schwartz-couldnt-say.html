<p>After <a href="//rubenerd.com/jonathan-schwartz-leaves-sun/">going public</a> with his intentions to, Jonathan Schwartz has migrated his <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/">former</a> Sun Microsystems blog posts <a href="http://jonathanischwartz.wordpress.com/">over to a new home</a> entitled &quot;Things I couldn&#39;t say…&quot;.</p>

<p>From his <a href="http://jonathanischwartz.wordpress.com/2010/02/11/opening-up/">first post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think I’ve said pretty much everything I could say as CEO of Sun Microsystems.</p>
<p>The more interesting stuff was What I Couldn’t Say. And that’s what this blog (and maybe a book) is going to be about.</p>
<p>Mostly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Needless to say I&#39;m subscribed in Google Reader and am eagerly anticipating reading what he has to say :).</p>
