<p>Three random and entirely pointless error messages for your consideration.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>The first, pictured above, is the eloquent <a href="http://twitter.com/i2yh">Neal O&#39;Carroll</a> from the <a href="http://www.intoyourheadpodcast.com/aaaapodcastblog/">aaaaaaaah Into Your Head podcast</a> letting people know his site hasn&#39;t gone off the deep end. I would never be caught making a grammar mistake or typo on my own site, and I&#39;d certainly never instruct people to &quot;click here&quot; but then put the link somewhere else. Looking forward to that pie though, it&#39;s going to be schweet. Wonder if I can ask him to pick mine up from the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hairy+lemon+dublin">Hairy Lemon</a>?</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.i2yh.stall.png" alt="Neal O'Carroll stalling my upload client" style="height:80px; width:500px; display:inline;" /></p>
<p>The second error, pictured above, is <a href="http://twitter.com/i2yh">Neal O&#39;Carroll</a> stalling my file transfer application. I thought his error message was overly cryptic and suspicious, and it turns out I was right. He clearly planted malware on the page so when I took a screenshot it attached itself to the file. It even survived processing and file conversion in The Gimp. He&#39;s a crafty one.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.fail.tweetdeck.png" alt="TweetDeck telling me not to panic" style="height:80px; width:500px; display:inline;" /></p>
<p>The second error, wait, third error, pictured above, is from <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/desktop/">TweetDeck</a> while I&#39;m using the public WiFi hotspot here. <strong>Don&#39;t panic!?</strong> That&#39;s easy enough for you to say, you&#39;re not addicted to Twitter through a Twitter client, you <strong>are</strong> the Twitter client! And who do you think you are, Douglas Adams?! Yeesh.</p>
