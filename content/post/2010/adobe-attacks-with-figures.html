<p>Adobe <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/flashplatform/2010/01/apples_ipad_--_a_broken_link.html">has responded</a> to the lack of Flash on the new <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/ipad/">iPad</a>, that Apple tablet device thingy if you haven&#39;t heard of it because you were teleported into the future or have been asleep for a few days.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://blogs.adobe.com/flashplatform/2010/01/apples_ipad_--_a_broken_link.html"><p>[…] without Flash support, iPad users will not be able to access the full range of web content, including over 70% of games and 75% of video on the web.</p></blockquote>

<p>Three observations I&#39;ll observe (observe observations, no, really?) in rapid-fire succession. One, where did they get those suspect figures from? Two, I was unaware YouTube accounted for less than 25% of online video. Three, 98% of irritating online advertisements and 90% of browser crashes are the fault of Flash which they conveniently failed to mention. Four, I created those numbers out of thin air much like I suspect they did. Those were four observations, but number one and four were related you see.</p>
<p>This morning <a href="//rubenerd.com/ipad-flash-is-google-ie6/">I defended</a> Apple&#39;s decision to not include Flash and compared it to Google deciding to stop supporting Internet Explorer 6. So far I haven&#39;t had any angry replies to it yet, perhaps it&#39;s the timezone difference.</p>
