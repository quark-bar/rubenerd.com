<p>I had a thought this afternoon. Should Chrysler sell Toyota the <strong>Dodge</strong> brand name, given people <strong>will be trying to</strong> when they see a Toyota <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009–10_Toyota_vehicle_recalls">uncontrollably accelerating</a> towards them?</p>
<p>Well that joke sounded wittier in my head. Wait wait, I can make it better! Suppose if its a technical problem, perhaps Toyota could ask <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology">Chuck Peddle</a> to help them! Get it? Chuck… <strong>PEDDLE</strong>? HA!</p>
<p>When I was a kid I dreamed of being a stand up comedian. For the sake of audiences around the world, it&#39;s probably a good thing that never happened.</p>
