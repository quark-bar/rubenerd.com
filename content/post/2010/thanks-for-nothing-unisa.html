<p>Please don&#39;t ask me to elaborate on specifics just yet, I will once I&#39;m safely enrolled somewhere else.</p>

Dear University of South Australia,</p>
<div style="font-weight:bold; text-align:center;">Your communications maketh Ruben sad</div>
<p>You now hold the distinction of being the biggest mistake I’ve made in my life to date. You turned what were supposed to be some of the better years of my life into an unmitigated disaster, which after recent family events I thought would be nigh impossible to do, relatively speaking. I knew I should have gone to Uni Adelaide, or Perth, or the <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/">NUS</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway I’m in the process of transferring away from you, and one day I’ll work up the guts to send you a letter like this instead of just posting it on my website.</p>
<p>Don’t lose any sleep over it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Ruben
