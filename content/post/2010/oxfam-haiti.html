<p>For those of you who haven&#39;t yet donated funds to help the people in Haiti, <a href="http://www.oxfam.org/en/emergencies/major-earthquake-haiti">Oxfam is accepting them</a>.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.oxfam.org/en/emergencies/major-earthquake-haiti"><p>Oxfam is responding to the biggest earthquake in 200 years to Haiti. We have 200 staff on the ground in Haiti and are delivering water and sanitation supplies now.</p>
<p>We have flown in 10 tons of water, health and shelter equipment, and we are appealing for donations now.</p>
<p>Oxfam has a staff of approximately 200 people in Haiti, including a group of highly-experienced emergency specialists. This emergency team is supporting rescue efforts, assessing the damage, and responding with public health, water, and sanitation services to prevent the spread of waterborne disease.</p>

<p>Oxfam is by far my favourite humanitarian organisation, they do amazing work and without any religious strings attached. I hope at some point in the future to do work for them.</p>
