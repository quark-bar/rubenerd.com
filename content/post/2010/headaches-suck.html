<p>Had another one of those incapacitating headaches today. It would make a mockery of the ones my mum had to call it a migraine, but it was enough to knock me out for most of the day.</p>
<p>Panadol, a lie down, Tiger Balm and drawn curtains are the things I usually do, if you&#39;re reading this what headache remedies do you recommend?</p>
