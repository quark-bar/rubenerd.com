<p>I was looking for something else entirely but came across two images from Code Geass that I&#39;d never seen before. Looking at the fine print it references R3 Zero Requiem which I&#39;m assuming is an OVA of some description. When I first learned all my anime terminology around 2005 I first thought OVA meant the show wasâ€¦ over! True story.</p>

<p>And to think I haven&#39;t even finished watching the <span style="font-weight:bold">R2</span> series yet! Or <a style="font-weight:bold" href="//rubenerd.com/tag/k-on/">K-On</a>! Or <a style="font-weight:bold" href="//rubenerd.com/tag/shaft/">Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei</a>! Not to mention <a style="font-weight:bold" href="//rubenerd.com/tag/saki/">Saki</a> which I let languish. And I finished <a style="font-weight:bold" href="//rubenerd.com/tag/bakemonogatari/">Bakemonogatari</a> but I haven&#39;t blogged about it! Ditto for <span style="font-weight:bold">Omamori Himari</span>! I&#39;m a terrible person.</p>
<h3>Pictures show things</h3>
<p>I like cats, but having grown up with pet dogs my entire life I loved the above one, it&#39;s a completely believable scene: I&#39;m exactly that way with our little dogs here :). <em>&quot;Who&#39;s that doggie? Who&#39;s that doggie? You want a treat? Who&#39;s that nice doggie?&quot;</em></p>
<p>As for the image below, it just further illustrates the implausibility of the women&#39;s Ashford Academy uniform; either that or C.C. put her skirt in the dryer and it shrunk. Yeah, that must be it. I suppose outfits on these shows aren&#39;t supposed to make sense, much like my discussions of said things on my blog here. Did I mention I dropped a heavy duty stapler on my head today?</p>
