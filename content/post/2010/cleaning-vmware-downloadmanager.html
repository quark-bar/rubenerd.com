<p>If you&#39;ve ever attempted a download from the VMware website on your Mac, chances are you have some junk files you can delete in a folder called &quot;<code>.DownloadManager</code>&quot; If you&#39;re as obsessed as me, you&#39;ll want to delete it!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>The delete is the bongly bong deng diggy diggy</h3>
<p>You can use the Finder by clicking the &quot;<code>Go</code>&quot; menu, then &quot;<code>Go To Folder…</code>&quot; and entering in &quot;<code>~/.DownloadManager</code>&quot;. Then you can safely delete the folder.</p>
<p>Alternatively, just use the Terminal:</p>
<pre>
% rm -r ~/.DownloadManager
</pre>
<p>Or for the paranoid:</p>
<pre>
% rm -irv ~/.DownloadManager
</pre>
<p>Or if you wanted to be really stupid and utterly superflous:</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;
my $junk = '~/.DownloadManager';
system("rm -r $junk");
while (1) { print("The Bird is The Word!n"); }
</pre>
<h3>One of these paragraphs is really important!</h3>

In this case, I was going through my home directory and found a ton of unessisary files. What surprises me is… I don&#39;t ever remember using VMware&#39;s Download Manager at all. Maybe someone went into my brain and altered my memories. What a terrifying prospect. </p>
<p>Did you know there&#39;s a place in South Australia called <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Prospect,_South_Australia">Prospect</a>? It&#39;s in Prospect. I assume its name was derived from the process of prospecting. Or maybe there was a prospective name, but it never materialised. You know if you spell materialised without the m, you don&#39;t get a name of a place in South Australia all. Coincidence? I think not. Wait, don&#39;t read too far into that previous sentence, however short it was.</p>
<p>As with all my posts, take my advice and use it at your own risk! I&#39;m assuming the only side effect would be that if you <strong>did</strong> use VMware&#39;s Download Manager (whatever that is) and you were part way through a download, you may need to start again.</p>
