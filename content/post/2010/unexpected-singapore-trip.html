<p>For [<em>sad face</em>] family reasons I&#39;ll be zipping back to Singapore for a fortnight tomorrow. I booked a convoluted route that had the effect of reducing both the airfare and probably my sanity by half. It&#39;ll be <strong><a title="Post: Adelaide Airport at 22:00" href="http://rubenerd.com/p3577/">Adelaide</a> &#8594; Melbourne &#8594; <a title="Post: Kuala Lumpur International Airport WiFi is sweet!" href="http://rubenerd.com/kuala-lumpur-international-airport-wifi-is-sweet/">Kuala Lumpur</a> &#8594; Singapore.</strong></p>
<p>The irony is, my sister flies to Melbourne quite often, and it takes her less time to get there from the Adelaide Airport than it does for me to get home from the airport using public transport. Adelaide Airport <strong>really</strong> needs <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CG1_changi_airport_faregates.jpg">one of these</a>.</p>
<p>See you in two weeks Adelaide peeps. Hey, that almost rhymed.</p>
