<p>I&#39;ve had my venerable MacBook Pro <a href="//rubenerd.com/?p=3911">since 2006</a> and as such I&#39;ve gone through several batteries. Up until yesterday this three month old unit could hold several hours of charge even with the screen at a reasonable brightness and WiFi enabled, but all of a sudden I can&#39;t get more than an hour and OS X is reporting the unit needs servicing.</p>
<p>Three questions: How could this have happened? Do Apple batteries have warranties you reckon? Is the Bird still The Word?</p>
