<p>For those of you who&#39;ve never been to Singapore, Chinese New Year weekend is similar to Christmas in that everywhere is almost completely deserted! It was such a stunningly bright and gorgeous day I replaced my workhorse 35mm with the much slower but wider 18-55mm VR to take some photos around the neighbourhood :)</p>

<p>The photos of the roads around the Orchard-Tanglin area don&#39;t seem terribly interesting until you realise this was taken on an early Saturday afternoon. It&#39;s usually one of the busiest roads in the country and it&#39;s almost deserted! And check out the footpaths!</p>

<p>Coming back from Starbucks where my dad and I chilled for an hour or so to take a break from scanning, digitising and collating his work documents I couldn&#39;t get over how beautiful the sky and trees looked, so I took a few more shots. They&#39;re not the sharpest photos, but set on 18mm the kit lens really captured the light and shadows well I thought. My 35mm would have been much sharper with less effort, but you would have obviously seen less.</p>
<p>Am I a professional photographer? No! Do I obey the Rule of Thirds? Only when I could be bothered. Do I have fun? Yes! ^_^</p>
