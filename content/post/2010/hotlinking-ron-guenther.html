<p>I get some inbound links from the most unlikely of places. This time it&#39;s from a blog called <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="http://fireronguenther.blogspot.com/">Fire Ron Guenther</a> which appears to be about one Illinois resident&#39;s desire to end the employment of someone called Ron Guenther.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<blockquote><p>This is a blog dedicated to informing folks about University of Illinois Athletic Director Ron Guenther and how he has screwed up Fighting Illini athletics. This is especially true regarding football during his tenure. If you live in East Central Illinois and you blindly believe Ron Guenther is the greatest thing to happen to Fighting Illini athletics, don’t read this blog! If you care about the Fighting Illini and want to see a winning athletics program, welcome!</p></blockquote>
<p>That has to be the longest blog tagline I&#39;ve ever read from Illinois. Come to think of it, that has to be the longest blog tagline I&#39;ve ever read, except for that blog that had that really long tagline.</p>
<p>Most people also append a short profile about themselves to blogs, something along the lines of &quot;My name is XYZ and I enjoy eating ice cream with barbecue sauce.&quot; Not to be outdone:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>About Me:</strong> I am not from East Central Illinois, so I am a realist and not a brownnoser of the DIA. I am tired of bad Illinois football and I demand change. Change starts at the top. Ron Guenther must go.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why can&#39;t I write taglines and personal profiles like that?</p>

<h3>The post in question</h3>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://fireronguenther.blogspot.com/2010/07/assistant-football-coach-leaves-before.html" style="font-weight:bold;">Assistant Football Coach Leaves Before Coaching A Game!</a> Look, we know Ron Zook is not a genius at football strategy….but this is further proof of how little he is respected</p></blockquote>
<p>That Ron Zook character doesn&#39;t seem to be a genius at avoiding <strong>hotlinking images</strong> from other sites either. Say, for example, hotlinking images from my site without even a citation. This despite being named after a <a href="http://www.zoukclub.com/">Singaporean night club</a> that I never went to because I was uncool before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory">uncool was cool</a>. Wait, Ron Zook wouldn&#39;t have written that post. Nevermind.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t disabled hotlinking here because then images don&#39;t come through on blog aggregators, butI do have a few Apache rules to block some sites. I&#39;m all for non profits and good causes though, so Fire Ron Guenther will get a pass. Apparently its about one Illinois resident&#39;s desire to end the employment of someone called Ron Guenther.</p>
