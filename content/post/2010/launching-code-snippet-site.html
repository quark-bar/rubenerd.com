<p>Given it&#39;s my birthday and all that, I thought I&#39;d use the time to announce an announcement: I [might be] starting a new blog thingy for code snippets!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>Here’s what I was thinking</h3>
<p>When I&#39;m stuck on a problem often it isn&#39;t the huge projects people have made public online that help me, they&#39;re little code snippets that show how to do something, how something works, or that elegantly demonstrate a concept. Other times I discover or learn how to do something myself and I make a note of it. These go for programming languages, package managers, resource and configuration files, how to talk to girls… wait, scratch that last one.</p>
<p>Over the years I&#39;ve hoarded a <strong>ton</strong> of these gems, and it occurred to me: why not make them public? I already blog way too much here, so I figured I could start a new blog where each post is <strong>just</strong> a snippet, and each will be tagged with the platform and language. Kinda like my current <a title="My dotfiles on RubenSchade.com" href="http://rubenschade.com/dotfiles/">dotfiles</a> folder on RubenSchade.com but with links. No extra fluff.</p>
<p>I&#39;m aware of a ton of sites that let you share code snippets, but I&#39;d prefer to keep things in house. I already <a title="Blog cloud category" href="http://rubenerd.com/cloud/">import my tweets each day</a> because the idea of having my data on a server I don&#39;t control worries me. Plus it&#39;ll be more fun :).</p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking of resurrecting my old Perl FastCGI script from the old days this blog back when it was on the RubenerdShow.com domain, I wrote it to be fast and it used more crypto than a nuclear submarine, plus it works on an SQLite database which kept things simple. Come to think of it, I forget why I moved off it in the first place.</p>
<p>Anyway stay tuned!</p>
