<p>I tend to be skeptical of class action lawsuits because often the solicitors or lawyers keep more of the money than the clients they represent, but in this case I&#39;m making an exception, if only for a very selfish reason ;).</p>

<p>From <a href="http://www.financialredress.com.au/">FinancialRedress.com.au</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Until very recently, some banks charged you up to $60 if you became overdrawn, went beyond an agreed limit, or made a late payment. The true cost might only have been a few dollars at most on each transaction. Banks have made billions from these unfair charges. [..]</p>
<p>If you have incurred at least one of these exception fees on any of your bank or credit card accounts, register by <a href="http://www.financialredress.com.au/FormContact.aspx">clicking here</a> to help get your money back.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Personal adventure things</h3>
<p>I closed my account with <a href="http://www.banksa.com.au/">BankSA</a> (now a subsidiary of Westpac, go figure) because of repeated and provable fee abuses. One time I was charged $25 for not having a minimum balance, which put me in the red, which caused them to charge me another fee. Then there was the time I forgot to prove I was a student for the umpteenth time, which meant new fees kicked in. The latter was probably within their legal right, but the former was an unabashed con.</p>
<p>That said, I went with the <a href="http://accu.com.au/">Australian Central Credit Union</a> which was great for a while, but then they started treating me like a bank would anyway by refusing to do what I asked to, sending me predatory credit card applications in the mail and long queues at their branches. Curiously this started happening when they got bought out by the imaginatively titled <a href="http://www.savingsloans.com.au/">Savings and Loans</a>.</p>
<p>What is about financial institutions and their mandate to screw their customers? What other industry charges people for the right to take our money? Sheesh.</p>
