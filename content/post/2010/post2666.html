<p>This latest <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">Pointless Rubenerd Milestone</a> blog post is so useless it should not be read by anyone. If you&#39;re just seeing this summary, leave it and move on. If you&#39;re subscribed in a blog reader and you can see the whole post, disregard it.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s out of the way we can get down to bidness. Despite the sluggish performance issues that have been plaguing this site since the wee hours of the morning, I&#39;ve finally been able to submit this post which, as I&#39;ve said, is completely pointless but represents a milestone only reached three other times in the history of the site.</p>

<p>Still haven&#39;t got it yet? Even with the friggen enclosed picture? The post is 2666, which has the number 666 in it! Run away! Head for the hills and don&#39;t return! If you live in Singapore which has no hills other than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukit_Timah_Nature_Reserve">these</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Faber">two</a> tiny ones, jump into the ocean or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuas_Second_Link">cross over</a> to Malaysia and head for the hills! AAAAAAAAA! Better still if you live in Adelaide, head to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hahndorf">Hahndorf</a> in the Hills and have some <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p3939/">really awesome German food</a>. :)</p>
<p>I know I&#39;ve already said this on the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/dont-look-now/">WordPress 666 ID post</a>, the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/666/">666th</a> post and the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/dont-look-now-its-a-useless-1666-post/">1666th</a> post, but Elfen Lied scared the heck out of me.</p>
<p>And here&#39;s where it gets really scary. I hadn&#39;t blogged about Firefox extensions for several months, but I did <a href="http://rubenerd.com/your-fav-browser-plugins/">this morning</a>. When was one of the last times I did an in-depth review of a Firefox extension? The <a href="http://rubenerd.com/ghostery-review/">same day</a> as post #1666. AAAAAAAAAAAAA!</p>

<h3>Update</h3>
<p>As I was typing up this post, I was so engrossed I forgot I&#39;d started toasting some bread and it <strong>set off the smoke alarm</strong>! I was typing up how Elfen Lied scared me and atheist-humanist 666 mock-scared me and THAT happened, at the same friggen time! I jumped so hard out my computer chair I slammed my knees on the underside of the table! OWIES!!!</p>
