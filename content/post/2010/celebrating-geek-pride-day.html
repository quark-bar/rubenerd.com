<p>I can&#39;t believe I almost missed this, today was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_Pride_Day">Geek Pride Day</a>!</p>

<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_Pride_Day"><p>Geek Pride Day is an initiative which claims the right of every person to be a nerd or a geek. It has been celebrated on May 25 since 2006, celebrating the premiere of the first Star Wars movie in 1977.</p>
<p>It shares the same day as two other science-fiction fan &#8216;holidays’ &#8211; Towel Day, for fans of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy Trilogy by Douglas Adams, and the Glorious 25th of May, for fans of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to that <a href="http://www.google.com/images?hl=en&#038;&#038;q=venn diagram nerd geek dork">now infamous venn diagram</a> showing the relationship between nerds, geeks and dweebs I&#39;m a dweeb owing to the fact I&#39;m socially inept. Still, Geek Pride Day is for all of us!</p>

I also spent much of the day <a href="//rubenerd.com/cloudsourcesg/">transfixed on a cloud computing keynote</a> by the CEO of SalesForce.com with their announcement of Cloud2 and Chatter, and I rewatched an anime series from 2008 because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toradora!">Minori</a> is awesome!</p>
<p>I would say more, but I fear I&#39;d be in violation of the Temporal Prime Directive.</p>
<h3>And he’s single folks!</h3>
