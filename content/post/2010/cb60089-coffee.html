<p><a href="http://twitter.com/cb60089/status/10302558566">@cb60089</a> just bought me a cup of coffee using the button on my blog sidebar, which makes him the epitome of awesomeness! Well he was the epitome of awesomeness before, but this just further cements his reputation. Thank you :).</p>
<p>I stopped putting ads on my blog a few years ago and replaced it with a coffee button, and I&#39;ve been blown away by people&#39;s generosity. I think this model works great, if your readers like what you do they&#39;ll support you, and from a purely business standpoint I&#39;ve been able to buy more coffee with that little button than years of having Google ads here!</p>
