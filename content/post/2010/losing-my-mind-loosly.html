<p>Compared to some other folks on the net I&#39;m not obsessed with language when it&#39;s not used properly, heck my posts here are constantly full of grammar mistakes. One of the few things that drives me mad is people&#39;s interchangeable use of <strong>lose</strong> and <strong>loose</strong>… <strong>still</strong>!</p>

<p>Despite thousands of derogatory motivational posters and people&#39;s signatures on forums explaining the difference, people <strong>still</strong> can&#39;t seem to grasp the difference between these two words. What&#39;s worrying is it’s not just people on MySpace-ish personal blogs talking about how awesome they think alcopops are, even <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1563038&#038;cid=31271346">commentators on Slashdot</a> of all places do it. Slashdot! Slash dot dash dot slash dot dash dot slash dot dash dot <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_Dot_Dash">slash dot com</a>.</p>
<p>For people whom English is a second language this is a perfectly understandable mistake to make, English is quite a nonsensical language, but for those who grew up using it there&#39;s no excoose, sorry excose, sorry excuse.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.writingcoursesblog.com/2010/01/word-crimes-lose-versus-loose-who-got-it-wrong.html">The Sydney Writer&#39;s Blog</a> for the photo; their page also demonstrates the proper use of loose and lose. I&#39;m not going to explain the difference here because aside from them plenty of people <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=loose+lose">already have</a> in hundreds of places as well.</p>
<p>Hey, and I used the word <strong>their</strong> and not <strong>they&#39;re</strong> and <strong>there</strong>! Good grief when I start learning German people are going to grill me.</p>
