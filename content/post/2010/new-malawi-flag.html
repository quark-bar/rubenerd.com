<p>Various vexillological societies and The Wikipedias are reporting that Malawi has changed its flag to restore the previous Pan-African colour layout, a change the opposition party is none too pleased with. I don&#39;t pretend to know or understand the political motivation behind the change, but I like it. It looks brighter, more cheerful :).</p>
<p>When I was growing up I was intensely interested in flags and logos because so many designs could be visually expressed with so few colours and geometric shapes. People used to call me a loser, can you believe it? Don&#39;t answer that.</p>
