<p>Apple has released new stuff, so because Slashdot and the like dub me an Apple fanboi it&#39;s my civic responsibility to discuss them… from my iTelephone. We still don&#39;t have home internet, you see :(.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>iPod shuffle</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I adore Apple products because they&#39;re the only consumer electronics company that can design things (and yes that includes B&amp;O!) but only Apple could remove buttons from something, make an advertising campaign out of it, then put the same buttons back and advertise it as a feature ;).</p>
<h3>iPod nano</h3>
<p>A very interesting change having a touch screen, but I wonder what impact it will have on usability, especially when you&#39;re walking around with your hand in your pocket. The ClickWheel was such a boon because you could operate it without looking, and you could memorise the order of the menus.</p>
<p>It also lost the ability to play video (which they heavily advertised in previous versions) and it no longer has a built in camera. In many ways its like the transition from the iPod Mini to the nano, they&#39;re two completely different devices. It&#39;s basically a slightly larger iPod shuffle with a screen.</p>
<h3>iPod touch</h3>
<p>There are lots of people who can&#39;t justify buying an iPhone 4 and an expensive new phone plan, and I know if I was one of them I&#39;d be really considering getting one of these now that it has the &quot;retina display&quot; too. I mean I look at the screen on my iTelephone and look at every single other phone on the market and I feel like someone has rubbed grit into my eyes, or my glasses are really dirty!</p>
<h3>Apple TV</h3>
<p>It has an A4 chip which I think we were all expecting. They were able to keep the interface true to the original though. Unfortunately, I must be one of the few people in the universe who doesn&#39;t like black or think its cool, so the new colour is a bit of a shame. Oh well, I&#39;m weird.</p>
<h3>iTunes</h3>
<p>For a brief moment in Leopard, iTunes looked like a Mac native application with a consistent interface. Now it looks different again, and I strongly doubt they&#39;ve made it a Cocoa application either. Honestly, iTunes is the easiest application to use to organise lots of music (as the name suggests!) but it&#39;s also the most unstable, unreliable application Apple ships. People were asking about 64 bit, but that won&#39;t happen until it&#39;s rewritten in Cocoa owing to Carbon&#39;s 32 bit limitation.</p>
<p>I suppose they don&#39;t want to do an Objective-C rewrite because they have so much invested in the current codebase, and they still want to make it reasonably portable for Windows users. Bummer.</p>
<h3>Ping</h3>
<p>The new iTunes music social network thing. As someone who&#39;s worked as a network administrator, I shudder a bit at their choice of name. Oh well, if people use it and like it. I prefer the <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/">Whole Wheat Radio</a> model, personally.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Some interesting changes, and its good to see Apple can still deliver stuff. I won&#39;t be getting any of it though. I mean, my iTelephone 4 has an iPod in it ;).</p>
