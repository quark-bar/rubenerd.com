<p>To all those companies that insist on sending people like me emails about what I can buy my mum, not cool, stop it.  To all the mums out there, <strong>lots of hugs for Mother&#39;s Day</strong>. I hope you spent it with family and friends and had a really good time. By that I mean you had lots of hugs and ate way too much cake to be healthy. If you didn&#39;t put on at least a kilo, I&#39;m not impressed!</p>
<p>And to mummy, if <strong>somehow</strong> you can read this, Happy Mother&#39;s Day to you too, I&#39;ve been thinking of you all day. Remember the time you knocked that giant plate of rice all over yourself in Ubud, then sheepishly looked up and said <em>&quot;heh… uh… shit!&quot;</em> Oh how we both thought that was amusing :). Missing you lots.</p>
