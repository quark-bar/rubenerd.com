<p>Today’s Wait, What Screenshot? (hey, that rhymes) comes to us from my installation of Mozilla Thunderbird, taken around lunchtime. According to Thunderbird, it downloaded <em>4,294,967,295</em> new messages during that session. There’s a bad pun about the sound a crazy bird makes in there somewhere.</p>
<p>Must be all my hate mail, or all my date rejection letters.</p>
