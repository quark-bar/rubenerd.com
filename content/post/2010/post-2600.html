<p>Once upon a time there was an obsessive blogger who didn&#39;t have a very exciting life, so when something as silly as a number synchronicity occurred on his website he just had to tell everyone, even if they didn&#39;t care! That&#39;s right, it&#39;s <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">pointless milestone</a> time!</p>

<h3>Before we go any further</h3>
<p>Before we go on (wait, I just said that), I&#39;d firstly like to point out that this is no ordinary <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">pointless milestone</a>… wait, hold that thought, did I <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">link</a> to that <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">tag</a> yet? Here, I&#39;ll link to it <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/"> here</a> just in case. Wait, did you miss it? Here it is <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">again</a>.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">pointless milestone</a> also happens to be a trippy syncronicity so vast in its complexity and co-incidence vectors, that I could make up a bunch of language in a sentence such as this one and pass it off as legitimate statistical analysis.</p>
<h3>Wait for it… here it is!</h3>
<p>Wait for it… here it is! Wait, I just said that! Hey, wait. <strong>This is Rubénerd post number 2600</strong>. Not only this, but WordPress in its infinite wisdom has also assigned this post with the <strong>ID of 6000</strong> which you can confirm yourself by going to the non-prettified URL:</p>
<p><a style="font-weight:bold" rel="nofollow" href="http://rubenerd.com/?p=6000">http://rubenerd.com/?p=6000</a></p>
<p>Look at that! Post number 2600, and it was given an ID of 6000! That&#39;s spooky and eerily beautiful, in a way. In celebration, I might go for an evening stroll around the park. The parks here don&#39;t have snow, but that probably means I&#39;m less likely to slip and land on my arse again. Emphasis on <strong>less</strong> likely.</p>
