<p>With my dad, sis and I moving internationally again and with this latest project, I haven&#39;t had much time for blogging or tweeting these last few days. I&#39;m really excited though, because I just finished a really unconventional project for a client and it worked beautifully!</p>
<p>I&#39;m not allowed to discuss the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws">Five W&#39;s</a>, but suffice to say it used a lot of a certain flavour of Java and a <strong>really</strong> ancient database. I&#39;m talking stone tablet ancient. And it worked! Yays! Alas for the sake of my anemic public resume/portfolio, this will be <em>yet another</em>  thing I can&#39;t add to it for NDA-like reasons. Oh well, I learned a <strong>heck of a lot</strong> and got lots of experience.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;ll be taking a small sabbatical and helping my dad and sis move in and organise whatnot. Will be nice ToLiveWithoutLongCamelCase and dusty old manuals with yellowing pages that made me sneeze for a while ;).</p>
