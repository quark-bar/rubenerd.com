<p>Having dabbled in a ton of different languages lately, I felt the overwhelming urge this week just to get back to some good ol&#39; C, and what better and more productive way to do so that to mess around with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/">ncurses</a>!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>I have to come clean and admit this, but I&#39;ve never really used ncurses for anything other than some rudimentary crap, and what little I did I&#39;ve completely forgotten in a vast ocean of nested Java System.in streamreaders. I&#39;ve written a ton of scripts and basic applications to run in the shell (mostly for server admin tasks) but I&#39;ve never used ncurses to make more sophisticated shell interfaces, so I thought I&#39;d finally give it a shot.</p>
<h3>Getting ncurses in the first place</h3>
<p>The first thing that <strong>always</strong> trips me up is I forget having the ncurses binaries (which most free and open source OSs do) is different from having the development versions you can include in C code. Fortunately it&#39;s really simple to install on at least the systems I maintain.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a quiz: which is for FreeBSD and which is for Fedora? :)</p>
<pre>
# pkg_add -rv <a href="http://www.freshports.org/devel/ncurses-devel/">ncurses-devel</a>
<strong>or</strong>
# cd /usr/ports/devel/ncurses-devel
# make install clean</pre>
<pre>
# yum install ncurses-devel
</pre>
<p>In either case, it works! Hallelujah! I can never spell that word.</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;
#include &lt;ncurses.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    initscr();
    printw("Grilled cheese sandwiches!");
    refresh();
    getch();
    endwin();

    return 0; /* Is all gooooood! */
}
</pre>
<h3>The iPad has just come out!? Why ncurses?</h3>
<p>Two reasons. First, I have a whole bunch of machines that just exist to run Folding@Home that don&#39;t have X on them at all, and I would love to create pretty little interfaces I could use with them.</p>
<p>Secondly, and you&#39;ll probably think it&#39;s silly, but our first family computer was a DOS machine and I&#39;ve always wanted to write my own *nix versions of some of my favourite old DOS applications that I can run in FreeBSD or on my Mac Terminal. For example, my favourite editor of all time is still the IBM E Editor, and having a version of that with syntax highlighting would make me ditch Vim, nano and TextMate for good! I know, I know, it&#39;s sad and silly, but it&#39;d be so much fun! Do any open source implementations of REXX exist? That was a fun language :).</p>
<p>My studies start again in two weeks, wonder how much of this I can do before then? At the very least I&#39;d like to have that old DOS menu system ported. Sounds like an alcoholic beverage.</p>
