<p><a href="http://library.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/2.30/">Gnome 2.30</a> has been released. It could have been an April Fools joke.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>Despite preferring Qt over GTK+ for application development, I still prefer Gnome to KDE4 from a user’s perspective, it’s almost like comparing Mac OS X to Windows. Gnome is elegant and clean, and while KDE4 has some impressive composting effects they just don’t feel well executed. Then again my favourite desktop is still Xfce.</p>
<h3>Random new feature observations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Salutations to the entire Nautilus team for getting rid of the spacial file manager, I never saw the attraction with windows spawning hundreds of other ones. Have they implemented a NeXT-like column view yet?</li>
<li>Double-clicking fonts to install them? Finally Gnome does what KDE has been doing for years!</li>
<li>I don’t use Epiphany, but it’s new interface also brings it in line with current contemporary browsers which is a Good Thing&trade;.</li>
<li>I’m really looking forward to playing some of the cute bundled games now that they use Clutter :)</li>
<li>You reckon they’ve fixed that Metacity bug where if you enable it’s composting engine, then restart, the shadow under the main menu disappears? It sounds like a silly little thing, but it’s graphical glitches like that that make DE’s feel less polished compared to Mac, et al.</li>
<li>The new default behavour of File Roller to download software required to extract archives is a fantastic idea, though I imagine this will probably be limited to Linux systems and not the BSDs.</li>
</ul>
