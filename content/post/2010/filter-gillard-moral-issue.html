<p>People have already discussed this issue to death already, but Gillard&#39;s comments have been festering in my brain like a… thing that festers.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>Julia Gillard is Uncle Fester?</h3>
<p>I&#39;m going to take a controversial stance here. When Julia Gillard billed the proposed compulsory internet filter in Australia as a &quot;moral issue&quot;, she was right. The problem is, despite numerous campaigns by organisations like the EFA, the misinformed still believe that this filter will not only be effective, but is necessary to maintain moral hygiene.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always asserted that the latter is irrelevant because the former simply isn&#39;t true. Even if it were this deeply important issue and we were all in favour of curbing our civil liberties, technologically it wouldn&#39;t be effective. Anyone who&#39;s used the internet for more than five minutes knows this.</p>
<p><strong>Right right right… the right is the bight. Bird bird bird… the bird is the word.</strong></p>
<p>Now Conroy claims they don&#39;t intend to filter P2P or channels other than the regular tubes. Right there, he&#39;s not only admitting the shortcomings of his policies and that ultimately its going to be useless, but he exposes it for what it is: a token effort to appease the religious right.</p>
<h3>Its a morale issue too… it makes me depressed</h3>
<p>It is a moral issue Ms Gillard, its about treating the Australian public like adults, not sacrificing their rights, and not putting the country at a further disadvantage to the rest of the world technologically.</p>
<p>Political history has taught us that sacrificing rights is easy, winning them back is like trying to make diamonds by putting quartz under your bed. I did this for many years, and all I ended up with were a couple of heavy shoeboxes.</p>
<p>I suppose <a href="//rubenerd.com/has-labor-shot-down-aussie-net-filter/">nothing has changed</a> since August after all. Which is a right royal bummer.</p>
