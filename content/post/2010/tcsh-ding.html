<p>As a FreeBSD guy (and even on my Linux boxes) I&#39;ve been using <a href="http://tcsh.org/">tcsh</a> as my shell for years, but I never noticed this easter egg before. If you have your prompt defined to show the time with <code>%T</code>, at the top of each hour (as my American friends say it) it replaces the time with the word &quot;<code>DING!</code>&quot;, how cute!</p>
<p>Chan-andler <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Bing</span> Ding! Ring a Ding Ding, it&#39;s a new hour! Is it sad that something like this made my day?</p>
