<p>Since <a title="Post: Clean Windows 7 upgrade from Windows 2000" href="//rubenerd.com/clean-windows-7-upgrade-from-windows-2000/">installing</a> my new student licenced copy of Windows 7 Professional in VirtualBox over the weekend, I&#39;ve been testing how well my Windows-only software runs in it compared to my trusty ol&#39; Windows 2000 VM. So far as good as can be expected, but there are few very strange anomalies.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>Case in point, my copy of Visio 2000 no longer works, but to my surprise the Microsoft Office website <a title="Microsoft.com: Try the Office 2007 system" href="http://trial.trymicrosoftoffice.com/trialaustralia/default.aspx">offers trial downloads</a> of both the Professional and Standard versions of Visio 2007 I went ahead and clicked the download link for the trial of Visio Standard 2007, and was given another Digital River executable stub file. This time I was in Windows not on my Mac though, so it was less irritating.</p>
<p>After downloading the real file I was given the above error message from the verbosely titled Program Compatibility Assistant telling me the application didn&#39;t run correctly. I had suffered a crash and all my gadgets disappeared an hour previously, but this application didn&#39;t terminate strangely or unexpectedly, and the Visio installer worked without a hitch. Very strange.</p>
<p>I did find it amusing that I downloaded the <strong>latest</strong> trial version of an application, and ran it on the <strong>latest</strong> flagship version of a vendor&#39;s operating system, and an application titled the <em>Program Compatibility Assistant</em> told me the application didn&#39;t run correctly.</p>
<p>I remember back in the old days whenever I downloaded something from Microsoft it would go through Conxion, was that the name of it? When did they replace them with Digital River?</p>
