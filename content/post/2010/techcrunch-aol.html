<p>To be honest I never really read it beyond the simplest of cursory glances, and I suppose that won&#39;t change. I remember wanting a <a href="http://rubenerd.com/afraid-tablet/">CrunchPad</a> though back when Arrington claimed it&#39;d be an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>People are claiming on The Twitters that it&#39;s the merging of one mediocre company into another. They&#39;re probably right, when Engadget was offered a <a href="http://rubenerd.com/gizmodo-iphone-apples-fault/">stolen</a> pre-release iPhone 4 they refused to take it. Ethics are dull.</p>
