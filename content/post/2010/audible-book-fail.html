<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Audible&#39;s fault, but that doesn&#39;t make it any less irritating or dissapointing, I heard amazing things about that book. Hey, &quot;heard&quot; amazing things, that was an above average pun for me.</p>
<p>Fortunately that was the first time that happened, every other book I&#39;ve been able to get without problems.</p>
