<p>Newt and Calista Gingrich, please report to the south coast of the US for cleanup duty.</p>
<p>The problem isn&#39;t that you&#39;re paying too much for petrol Newt, its that you&#39;d rather spend time and effort drilling in the middle of the friggen ocean instead of developing alternatives, all under a thin veil of patriotism. Any temporary reduction in prices would only provide temporary relief, and would do <strong>nothing</strong> to solve either the energy crisis of which you speak, or energy independence.</p>
<p>I&#39;m assuming he wasn&#39;t <a href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?productID=BK_OASI_000276&amp;BV_UseBVCookie=Yes">being sarcastic</a>, if you were sir then please disregard.</p>
