<p>I&#39;m trialling a new wider version of <a href="//rubenerd.com/">my blog theme</a>, and some clearer fonts for FLOSS OS users, let me know how terrible you think the changes are :). If you can&#39;t see the difference, you may need to hold down <code>[SHIFT]</code> while reloading the page. I almost made a typo and wrote <code>[SHIFT]</code> as something else.</p>
<p>By sheer co-incidence I realised this beta blog theme is the same size as <a href="http://www.zombieskittles.com/">ZombieSkittles</a> without the border. Creepy!</p>
<h3>Wait, update!</h3>
<p>I reverted back to the same width I first starting blogging in back in 2004, but kept the new fonts for the FLOSS folk. Call me old fashioned. Or fickle.</p>
