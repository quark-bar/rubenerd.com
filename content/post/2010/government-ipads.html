<p>TheNextWeb Canada is <a title="Saskatchewan Government Holds First Cabinet Meeting with iPads" href="http://thenextweb.com/ca/2010/11/12/saskatchewan-government-holds-first-cabinet-meeting-with-ipads/">reporting</a> that ministers in Saskatchewan (hey, spelled it right the first try!) have started using iPads. They seem almost <strong>too</strong> excited by their new toysâ€¦ or at least one of them is!</p>
<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the hardware and think that anything that can reduce costs and improving service is a Good Thing, but I&#39;m wary of governments relying upon one device from one foreign company. As much as it pains me to admit it, in this circumstance I&#39;d probably prefer them using Android tablets. Android isn&#39;t entirely free either, and the tablet hardware will be unabashedly and unashamedly cloning the iPad, but it&#39;s a start.</p>
<p>According to the Twitters, here in Australia Greens senator Scott Ludlum and Liberal MP Malcolm Turnbull have started using iPads too, but more in a personal capacity.</p>
