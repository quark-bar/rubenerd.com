<p>If you&#39;re a Windows user, it&#39;s safe to start using <a title="Mozilla Firefox" href="http://getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> again.  Firefox has been <a title="Links to download Firefox 3.6.2" href="http://www.mozilla.com/products/download.html?product=firefox-3.6.2">updated to 3.6.2</a> which fixes that nasty exploit CERN discussed and recommended people switch browsers for on the Windows platform.</p>

<h3>Oh no, he’s going to say it… wait for it..</h3>
<p>As if we all needed another reason for using NoScript.</p>
<h3>Aaaaah he said it! Ugh, I need a lie down</h3>
<p>It&#39;s no silver bullet magic potion solution that shields your computer with 1337 ninja oompa loompas, but for zero day exploits of this nature it at least gives you some protection before a security hole is fixed &#8212; or even discovered. Every application has bugs, and we can never assume other people aren&#39;t taking advantage of them without our vendor&#39;s knowledge.</p>
<p>You&#39;re all bored to tears hearing me say this, but I&#39;m still baffled by the relative lack of dynamic content whitelisting in browsers. If this security hole had been found in another browser, or Firefox without a plugin akin to NoScript, it could have potentially caused even more damage.</p>
<p>Kudos to Google for including JavaScript and cookie whitelisting as a build in feature in the latest build of Chrome.</p>
