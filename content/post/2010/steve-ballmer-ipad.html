<p>Steve Ballmer <a href="http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipod-itunes/news/index.cfm?newsid=3233803">has commented</a> on the success of the iPad, calling it an <em>&quot;interesting product&quot;</em>, only to then defend his company&#39;s own record by stating they&#39;d been <em>&quot;selling Windows on tablet computers for years&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>He also said the iPhone had &quot;no chance&quot; of gaining significant market share in 2007. He bought and ruined Danger (should have stuck with NetBSD). He trumpeted the Courier as a tangible competitor even though it never got past the concept video stage. He abandoned the Kin project almost as soon as the phones went to market. The Zune had a &quot;squirt&quot; feature and came in brown!</p>
<p>Forgive me if I don&#39;t take his words very seriously, especially in the mobile space.</p>
