<p>Dear Optus,</p>
<p>If you&#39;re not going to deliver all my phone messages to their intended recipients, whether it be from any of my current handsets, I expect to be compensated with a lower monthy rate. This seems fair.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Ruben</p>
<p>PS: SingTel, please whip your boy into shape. And get him to stop with the &quot;unlimited&quot; advertising too, you might get into trouble for that with a four letter acronym.</p>
