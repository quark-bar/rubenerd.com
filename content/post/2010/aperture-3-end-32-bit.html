<p>Having <a href="http://rubenerd.com/nikon-micro-lenses/">just spoken about photography</a>, a few hours ago Apple released <a href="http://apple.com/aperture/">Aperture 3</a>. One thing of note is the white box instead of black, shock of horrors! Of note for my own personal circumstances was the phrasing of the system requirements:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://apple.com/aperture/"><p>Aperture 3, which runs as a 64-bit application on Intel Core 2 Duo Macs running Mac OS X Snow Leopard [â€¦]</p></blockquote>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>I&#39;ve been saying on this blog for years that my 2006-vintage Core Duo MacBook Pro still works and does everything I need it to, but perhaps this is a sign that it&#39;s the end of the road for it as far as Apple is concerned. Perhaps this means Mac OS X 10.7 will only be 64-bit as well; could Snow Leopard be the latest OS X I&#39;ll be able to run on it?</p>
<p>I thought it was very odd that they timed the transition to Intel only months <em>before</em> the 64-bit Core 2 Duo processor, so they&#39;ve had to support  those precious few 32-bit machines like mine when they could have been entirely x64 from the start. If this is the start of 64-bit only applications at Apple, I applaud them for it; despite having a 32-bit MacBook Pro, the vast majority of the install base is 64-bit and machines like mine are weighing everybody else down.</p>
<h3>Interim transition time?</h3>
<p>Perhaps this may be the excuse I need to start rebooting into my FreeBSD partition on this MacBook Pro on a more regular basis to get used to it in anticipation of no more updates! I know it&#39;s <strong>not politically correct</strong> to admit it but I adore <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The Gimp</a>, now I just need a photo management application that isn&#39;t some terrible Mono .NET thing.</p>
