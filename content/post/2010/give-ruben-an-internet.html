<blockquote><p>Welcome to the Internetometer. The goal of this online game is to provide a scientifically accurate* measurement of how much you win at life.</p></blockquote>
<p>I stumbled across the <a href="http://internetometer.com/">Internetometer</a> early this morning which proports to gauge how much you win at life, as that description already demonstrated. If you&#39;d like to give me An Internet, feel free to hit the link above. And feel free to add one to your site. I&#39;m all for scientific research, and you should be too.</p>
