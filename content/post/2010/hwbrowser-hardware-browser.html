<p>hwbrowser is a slick little GTK application that probes your Linux machine&#39;s hardware and presents the results in a two pane window, in a similar fashion to OS X&#39;s Hardware Profiler.</p>

<h3>Some things I like about it</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fast, simple, no nonsense</li>
<li>Self explanatory, no docs needed (or are provided!)</li>
<li>Uses GTK but doesn’t use any of the Gnome APIs, so you can use it on DEs like Xfce without too many dependencies</li>
<li>For a FOSS application the icon is surprisingly well detailed and cute &#8212; very important!</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s certainly no replacement for <code>procfs</code> or <code>dmesg</code> piped to less/more, but if you just want a quick and broad overview of the hardware on your system it&#39;s spiffy. It&#39;s also quite old, but given its not available on FreeBSD I could be forgiven for not knowing of its existance… right?</p>
<h3>Almost works great on Fedora</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve settled on Fedora as my Linux distribution of choice; as far as I know hwbrowser isn&#39;t installed by default but it&#39;s available from the free YUM repos. The only caveat is for some reason the <code>Hard Drive</code> tab remains blank.</p>
<p>Fedora 13 is out but my machines are still on 12 at the time of this post.</p>
