<p>You know that now notorious error message you sometimes see on YouTube videos claiming the music in a video was copyrighted and had been disabled?</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>Out of curiosity I clicked the Learn More link and was told this on their <a href="http://www.youtube.com/t/howto_copyright">Copyright Tips</a> page:</p>
<blockquote><p>What is copyright infringement?</p></blockquote>
<p>Now now, nobody likes a rhetorical question, do they?</p>
<blockquote><p>Copyright infringement occurs when a copyrighted work is reproduced, distributed, performed, publicly displayed, or made into a derivative work without the permission of the copyright owner.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah that nagging little thing called <strong>&quot;fair use&quot;</strong> is such a spanner in the works, isn&#39;t it?</p>
