<p>I&#39;ve got a huge backlog of unfinished blog posts (at least 300 at last count) so I&#39;ve decided to create an entirely new one based on what <a href="http://linkbaitgenerator.com/">this website told me</a> to do.</p>
<blockquote><p>8 things you probably didn’t know about Microsoft</p></blockquote>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>Here we go!</h3>
<ol>
<li>We have IBM to thank for their monopoly status. Which is a shame because I still heart their E Editor even to this day and I have a Rational lanyard.
</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=&quot;Madobe%20Nanami&quot;">Madobe Nanami</a> (aka Windows 7-Tan) made me almost consider plonking down $10,000 or however much it is for Windows 7 Ultimate.
</p>
</li>
<li>&quot;Rick James&quot; is not a supported .NET language, bitch.
</p>
</li>
<li>REVERSI.EXE was better than WINMINE.EXE, and I actually thought BOB.EXE was pretty cool, even though you’re not supposed to admit it.
</p>
</li>
<li>OOXML is an interoperable standard because it can render * like Word 95, and the acronym’s suspicious similarity to OOo is purely a coincidence.
</p>
</li>
<li>Being caught using Google in Redmond, Washington is a chair throwable offence, unless you’re a developer developer developer.
</p>
</li>
<li>Selling mediocrity is difficult for most, but Microsoft seems to be able to do it without even trying.
</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nickhodge.com/blog/">Nick Hodge</a> and Ari Bixhorn are seemingly exempt from the company’s officially mandated PR lameness policy.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
