<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/logo.m1.png" alt="" style="background:transparent; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px; width:52px; height:52px;" /> When registering for Wireless@SG a few years ago, I chose Qmax as my provider because they worked well with outlets supplied by SingTel and StarHub. Unfortunately, both Starbucks at Ion Orchard and the Coffee Bean at Bishan Junction 8 have inexplicably adopted M1 over SingTel, and Qmax is no longer listed as a provider.</p>
<p>My mum had a phone with M1, and the experience taught us to never use them for anything serious again. I suppose this is their way of seeking revenge :P.</p>
