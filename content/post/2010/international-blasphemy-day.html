<p>I forgot that the 30th of September was <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2010/09/what_did_you_do_for_blasphemy.php">International Blasphemy Day</a>! To repent for forgetting, I&#39;ll merely make the observation that if we&#39;ve discovered a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Gliese_581_g">new habitable planet</a>, will their inhabitants have to be &quot;saved&quot; by our religions too? I mean, they&#39;ve been living in sin this entire time and they didn&#39;t even know it!</p>
<p>Space fairing missionariesâ€¦ now there&#39;s a terrifying thought <strong>&gt;___&lt;</strong>. Damn you Lord Xenu!</p>
