<blockquote><p>The very existence of flamethrowers proves that sometime, somewhere, someone said to themselves, &quot;You know, I want to set those people over there on fire, but Iâ€™m just not close enough to get the job done.&quot; <cite>~ George Carlin</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Damn it, I miss you George.</p>
