<p>And it works! Yays! ^<em>^ I&#39;ll be detailing how on Sunday when I have more time, suffice to say it was far more complex and time consuming than I &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s</em>law&quot;&gt;imagined it would be</a>. The Windows 95 partition has also been preserved, albeit in a smaller partition.</p>
<p>It may be a nerdy thing to admit, but working on puzzles like this and solving them is just about the greatest feeling in the world. ^_^</p>
