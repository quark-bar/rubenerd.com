<p>It&#39;s the kind of thing you&#39;d already know about if you were interested in it, but <a href="http://openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a> just released 2.3.0, wait sorry, 3.2.0. It helps to know what you&#39;re talking about before you start taking. I wonder if it&#39;ll have <a href="//rubenerd.com/sun-oracle/">Oracle branding</a>?</p>

<h3>Update</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve been using it for a few hours on my Core Duo MacBook Pro on Snow Leopard and it&#39;s <strong>fast</strong>. I never thought I&#39;d use the word <strong>fast</strong> along with <strong>OpenOffice.org</strong> but they&#39;ve really improved the load times and general responsiveness.</p>
<p>The primary OOo application I use is the Calc spreadsheet application. I prefer <a href="http://gnome.org/gnumeric/">Gnumeric&#39;s</a> clean interface and it&#39;s faster and more stable, but Calc does a better job with importing Excel files I&#39;m sent. Calc still isn&#39;t as fast as Gnumeric (nothing else is!) but it&#39;s noticeably better than it was before. My GCC optimisation sheet I&#39;ve talked about a few times in the past here that has thousands of rows loads more quickly and scrolling is <strong>much</strong> smoother. In my opinion this 3.2 release is bigger news than the major 3.0 one.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll post more details when I&#39;ve had time to play around with it some more. Is it a sad state of affairs when a guy like me gets more excited by a new office suite than a new FPS? ^_^</p>
<h3>Another update!</h3>
<p>Within minutes of posting my update above, it seems the Lotus folks have <a href="http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/buzz.nsf/web_DisPlayPlugin?open&amp;unid=3628BD42B1674AB1852576C000465C1A&amp;category=teams">released 3.0 beta 2</a> of their IBM Lotus Symphony suite. Wonder if the code base has been brought up to parity yet? The interface of their app is the best I&#39;ve ever used.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an interesting time for office stuff. Wonder when iWork 2010 will be out?</p>
