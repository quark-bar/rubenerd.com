<p>The folks running the <a href="http://twitter.com/buseireanndeals/">Bus Eireann Deals</a> Twitter account <a href="http://twitter.com/buseireanndeals/status/10717889562">asked people</a> this evening to trial their <a href="http://194.106.151.190/smartinfo/service/jsp/?olifServerId=203&amp;autorefresh=0&amp;default_autorefresh=15&amp;routeId=203%2F1&amp;stopId=Dublin+%28Busaras%29&amp;optDir=-1&amp;nRows=10&amp;allLines=y&amp;showArrivals=n&amp;optTime=now&amp;time=">new alert system</a> and provide feedback. This post is a response to said request.</p>

<p>Let me just start by saying I&#39;m so thoroughly <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">disjointedness</span> disappointed (dang this Firefox spell checker is hopeless!) with their service I could harpoon an Attitude Chicken. Wait, Bob Geldof <strong>is</strong> Irish isn&#39;t he?</p>
<p>I tried three buses, read that <strong>three</strong> buses and the service couldn&#39;t even find them, let alone give me timetable or fare information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_routes_in_Singapore#100.E2.80.93199">105</a> from Lorong Chuan to Scotts Road</li>
<li>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_routes_in_Singapore#1.E2.80.9399">75</a> from Holland Village to Marina Centre</li>
<li>The misleadingly titled <a href="https://www.aeroline.com.sg/">Aeroline</a> from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur</li>
</ul>
<p>When we were in Ireland the weather was so bad we kept hearing how Bus Eireann were having to cancel services. We almost booked a bunch of trips with them, whew!</p>
