<p>I&#39;ve finally found a drive that <a href="http://partedmagic.com/">PartedMagic</a> can&#39;t handle, but fortunately I still have a friend in <code>dd</code>. Sounds like a trailer for an episode of Dexter&#39;s Laboratory. <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Even better, use an old Knoppix CD!</p>

<p>PartedMagic is a Linux live CD optimised for drive maintainence with tools such as <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/">GParted</a> and <a href="http://www.partimage.org/Main_Page">Partition Image</a> that I&#39;ve been recommending and using for a few years. I was an avid fan of <a href="http://www.symantec.com/norton/theme.jsp?themeid=partition_magic">PartitionMagic</a> before Symantec bought the company that developed it and killed the project, and PartedMagic filled that void really well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the [relatively new] WD hard drive that came with my [relatively ancient!] <a href="//rubenerd.com/90s-nostalgia-libretto-70ct/">Libretto 70CT</a> has been the first drive since I started using PartedMagic that the bundled applications simply can&#39;t handle. GParted reports that it can&#39;t read the data and as such I can&#39;t resize the partitions, and Partition Image simply panics and quits.</p>
<h3>Is someone eating sushi or are things just fishy?</h3>
<p>The Windows 95 partition boots on the machine and works flawlessly, ScanDisk doesn&#39;t find anything, I&#39;ve run SpinRite on level 2 and 4 for several long days, I&#39;ve done every file system integrity check known to humanityâ€¦ NONE of them reports problems.</p>
<p>What I want to do is keep the Windows 95 partition intact but shrink it by a few gigabytes so I can run FreeBSD with my ncurses environment I&#39;ve been developing. As it stands now, GParted/libparted can&#39;t read the data in the 95 partition even though it boots fine, the drive is fine and the filesystem is fine. I think.</p>
<p>I read on a few forums that people have had success with FAT systems running older live CDs when this problem occurs, and they surmise there may be an error in the newer versions. I&#39;m willing to give it a shot, in the meantime I&#39;m <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=dd">using dd to copy the whole drive</a> to an image file as a backup, but I need to be able to resize this.</p>
<p>I wonder if hdiutil could do it? Hdiutil can resize non HFS+ partitions provided they&#39;re not running the system, can&#39;t it? I&#39;m sorry this whole post was an excuse to think out loud!</p>

<h3>Update!</h3>
<p>Turns out those forum folks were absolutely right, I tried an old version of Knoppix from 2005 and it worked flawlessly! The newer versions of libparted must have introduced a bug with old FAT filesystems, or something.</p>
