<p>Looks like Steve Jobs has been <a title="MacRumors: Steve Jobs Weighs in on iPad International Pricing and Taxes" href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=912999">answering questions directly again</a> and garnering a lot of <em>&quot;wow he&#39;s so rude&quot;</em> responses. Oh yeah, and the iPod Touch is <em>&quot;just&quot;</em> a small iPad. Wait.</p>

<p>Personally, I find his terse answers refreshing and far more polite than the corporate, sugar coated marketing BS I&#39;m used to reading from companies. I find it insulting when companies feel they have to talk to me like a kid instead of just telling me what they really think.</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;We’re solution providers that promote synergy and cohesiveness within an organisation by structuring data in more meaningful, exciting and useful ways. To continue to offer such incredible service we’re requesting a temporary and completely understandable increase in our service charge…&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We need more funds for the system.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>I suppose rudeness is in the eye/ear/organ of the reader/beholder, I prefer it when people are more direct with me in real life too. Well, to a point. Stephen Bastian beating me up in high school because I was ugly or that I said something he didn&#39;t like was a bit much. That&#39;s right, Stephen Bastian, I think he lives in Melbourne now.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve emailed Steve a couple of times, once to tell him I thought the way the press were dealing with his illness <a href="//rubenerd.com/steve-jobs-health/">was disgusting</a>. Never got a reply, probably a clerical error ;).</p>
