<p>I just updated <a href="http://apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a> to 9.1, seems they&#39;re gearing up for the iPad release because my &quot;Audiobooks&quot; library is now a subheading in a new library called &quot;Books&quot;. Wonder how many long years it&#39;ll take for books to be available in Australia and/or Singapore?</p>
<p>Oh and by the way Apple, when are we getting a Cocoa version of iTunes? I run <a href="http://ecouteapp.com/">Ecuote</a> and Exaile, the latter of which is a GTK+ X11 app and it&#39;s still faster and more reliable.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I wonder if I can start dragging ePub books into this now? That&#39;d be really, really, really cool!</p>
