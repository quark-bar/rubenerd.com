<p>I know <a href="http://rubenerd.com/oecd-wikipedia/">I just poked fun at Wikipedia</a> for its unnecessary verboseness and repetition, but like the hypocrite I am I&#39;m going to poke fun at repetition by performing a repetition of blog post topics. Here are the first three paragraphs of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra">Canberra article on Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<blockquote><p>Canberra is the capital <strong><em>CITY</em></strong> of Australia. With a population of over 345,000, it is Australia’s largest inland <strong><em>CITY</em></strong> and the eighth largest Australian <strong><em>CITY</em></strong> overall. The <strong><em>CITY</em></strong> is located at the northern end of the Australian Capital Territory, 280 km (170 mi) south-west of Sydney, and 660 km (410 mi) north-east of Melbourne.</p>
<p>The site of Canberra was selected for the location of the nation’s capital in 1908 as a compromise between rivals Sydney and Melbourne, Australia’s two largest <strong><em>CITIES</em></strong>. It is unusual among Australian <strong><em>CITIES</em></strong>, being an entirely planned <strong><em>CITY</em></strong>. Following an international contest for the <strong><em>CITY’s</em></strong> design, a design by the Chicago architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin was selected and construction commenced in 1913.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>CITY’s</em></strong> design was heavily influenced by the garden <strong><em>CITY</em></strong> movement and incorporates significant areas of natural vegetation that have earned Canberra the title &#8220;bush capital&#8221;. Although the growth and development of Canberra were hindered by the World Wars and the Great Depression, it emerged as a thriving <strong><em>CITY</em></strong> after World War II.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s right, the word city (or cities) is used eleven times, often several times in the same sentence. And it&#39;s got Featured Article status! Don&#39;t get me wrong, I use Wikipedia daily and love it, but I&#39;ve long had trouble with some of their editors. Some of my contributions have been revoked (and in some cases <a href="http://rubenerd.com/wikipedia-problems/">mocked with insulting comments</a>), and yet an article as poorly worded as this gets Featured Article status? Not that I&#39;m bitter or anything.</p>
<p>That reminds me, I need to go into the <strong><em>CITY</em></strong> today by taking the <strong><em>CITY</em></strong> train to the <strong><em>CITY</em></strong> so I can get to the <strong><em>CITY</em></strong> to buy stuff I can only get in the <strong><em>CITY</em></strong> while in the <strong><em>CITY</em></strong>! Wonder if I&#39;ll have time to go to <strong><em>CITY</em></strong> Wok?</p>
