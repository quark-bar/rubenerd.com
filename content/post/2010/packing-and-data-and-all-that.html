<p>Don&#39;t read this post, it&#39;s completely pointless.</p>

<p>Remember when I said we were trying to get rid of crap? During our last family move we had over <strong>700</strong> boxes plus <strong>80</strong> in two self storage lockers. On this latest move we cleared out all the storage and combined have just shy of <strong>380</strong>. Some of it was my mum&#39;s stuff, but a lot of it was just junk we never used. For example, we had <strong>nine</strong> scanners. Jebus.</p>
<p>I think we could have got rid of even more but time was against us; I figure when we arrive at the new place we can keep getting rid of crap. The money we&#39;re going to save from renting a smaller place to not needing extra storage will go a long way.</p>
<p>Anyway the packers are about to turn off the router, so better go. Tethered iTelephone to the rescue!</p>
<p>While we&#39;re on the subject, isn&#39;t it pathetic that I get more data on my <strong>phone</strong> in Singapore than I do on home net connections in Australia? We transferred hundreds of gigabytes of data this month on our home internet connection at full speed: movies, persistent VPN connections, other tunnels to control systems, online games, musicâ€¦ and certain Aussies keep telling me throttling is necessary and you only need a few gig a day. Wonder how many fat cheques they&#39;re getting from the NBN folks and the ISPs to astroturf for them? ;).</p>
<p>Ugh I haven&#39;t had more than three hours sleep a night for a week. Perhaps I should seek out one of those panda eye remedy things they always advertise on the sides of buses here.</p>
