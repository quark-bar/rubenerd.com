<p>Earlier this month CNET&#39;s David Carnoy compiled a list of <a title="iPhone 4G: 25 most-wanted features (photos)" href="http://reviews.cnet.com/2300-6454_7-10002721.html?s=0&#038;o=10002721">25 features</a> he wanted for the next generation iTelephone. This is my own personal take on them… which isn&#39;t to say other people don&#39;t have different needs!</p>

<h3>Bad ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>OLED screen</strong>. I want my screen to be readable in daylight and have my favourite colours last as long as all the others.</li>
<li><strong>RFID</strong>. REALLY BAD IDEA. I don’t want to have to carry my phone in a metal sleeve like those new passports!</li>
<li><strong>Flash support</strong>. Apple refusing to support it on their best selling platform is one of the primary forces behind the elimination of Flash.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Meh ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Better sound from built-in speakers</strong>. Some people play music through the phone’s speakers on the train. I want them lynched.</li>
<li><strong>Better Google Voice support</strong>. Perhaps it’s because I don’t have a North American accent, but Google Voice never really worked well at all anyway.</li>
<li><strong>Expandable memory</strong>. Not likely, but it’d be cool I suppose. They could have a SIM card like slot if they’re afraid of dirt and disrupting the clean lines.</li>
<li><strong>HD output</strong>. Why?</li>
<li><strong>Less restrictive Bluetooth</strong>. As long as they gave the option to keep the restrictions in place.</li>
<li><strong>Improved voice control</strong>. Never used it in my current iPhone, and have never felt the need to. I suppose others might want it.</li>
<li><strong>802.11n</strong>. I guess it’s the natural evolution, but if so give us the option to turn it off to save power.</li>
<li><strong> Removable battery</strong>. Would rather all that space for a catch mechanism etc be used for extra battery.</li>
<li><strong>Improved camera with video chat (camera on front).</strong> Ew, video chat.</li>
<li><strong>Multitasking</strong>. As long as it’s done well, and has the ability to be disabled. WiMo phones were terrible for this, and Android multitasking horror stories are everywhere.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Good ideas</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Biometric security</strong>. As long as it was implemented with sound cryptography instead of just being a gimmick.</li>
<li><strong>More memory</strong>. Would be nice to have more than 16GiB, but more likely I’d get the same amount which would then be cheaper.</li>
<li><strong>Reasonably priced tethering</strong>. For the same price that SingTel gives me GB, Optus in Australia gives me MB, and they charge more for tethering -_-.</li>
<li><strong>External keyboard support</strong> This has been what I’ve been asking for since I got my iPhone. Who would need a crappy netbook then?</li>
<li><strong>Better app organization and file management</strong>. I’d be happy with just a customisable heading for each page.</li>
<li><strong>4G network compatible</strong>. Would be great to use in Singapore, but in most of Australia I barely get 3G. Can we get that working at least, Optus?!</li>
<li><strong>Trimmer, sleeker design</strong>. Having sides like the iPad would be schweet :)</li>
<li><strong>Improved 3D graphics</strong>. I’d be content with a more responsive UI, though I suppose I’m still on an iPhone 3G.</li>
<li><strong>Faster processor like the A4</strong>. This is where Apple really has all their competitors licked. I can’t wait to see the silicon that goes into the next iPhone!</li>
<li><strong>Better battery life</strong>. Another no-brainer.</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn&#39;t include <strong>More carriers</strong> or <strong>Fewer failed and dropped calls</strong> because his critique was aimed at US phone companies.</p>
