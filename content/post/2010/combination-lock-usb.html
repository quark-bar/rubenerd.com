<p>From the <em>I Can&#39;t Believe They&#39;re Serious</em> department, Bruce Schneier has <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2010/03/usb_combination.html">blogged</a> about a hilarious <a href="http://www.staplespromotionalproducts.com/ProductDetail.aspx?id=2953">memory key product</a> (link fixed) that doesn&#39;t get its security from sound, well implemented cryptography, but from.. get thisâ€¦ a two wheel physical combination lock that hides the contact pins!</p>

<blockquote><p>Make sure your important files are locked up with a Combination Lock USB Flash Drive. Each custom flash drive uses two 10-digit dials to provide access to the USB plug and keep your files safe.</p></blockquote>
<p>The best (and most revealing) part of the product description is in the second paragraph.</p>
<blockquote><p>A great gift for technology companies, these logoed flash drives show potential customers how seriously your company takes its security.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, yes it does.</p>
<p>What&#39;s worrying is I&#39;d wager a nice sushi lunch that if someone like Senator Conroy saw this, he&#39;d buy hundreds of them and use them to carry around sensitive, confidential government data about us. I&#39;m scared, <strong>really scared</strong>.</p>
