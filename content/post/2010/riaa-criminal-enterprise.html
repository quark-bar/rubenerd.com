<p>Absolutely the best description outside WholeWheatRadio.org I&#39;ve read of the RIAA, in a <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20010164-261.html">comment on a CNET story</a> of all places:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20010164-261.html"><p>The RIAA as a group of members is a criminal enterprise. It has been found guilty of price-fixing, collusion, market manipulation and likely other RICO (and perhaps criminal) violations. Only their political donations to [Washington] keep them from looking like the mafia as far as the law goes.</p>
<p>The RIAA’s claims of &quot;theft&quot; falls on deaf ears. They have legally unclean hands in their claim to ownership of artist’s music. Many artist’s find they are in dept to the industry through it’s &#8220;creative book-keeping&#8221; in what amounts to modern indentured servitude. These situations are engineered to keep the artist’s poor and the RIAA in charge of distribution and profit.</p>
<p>Shut-em-down… Don’t feel guilty, stealing from a thief isn’t stealing in a moral sense and perhaps not in the legal sense either. Unclean hands…</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d also add that their claim of &quot;theft&quot; falls on deaf ears because <strong>theft != copyright infringement</strong>, as I <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/piracy-copyright/">talked about a year ago</a>.</p>
<h3>Optimistic pessimism?</h3>
<p>I can&#39;t sing (although I&#39;ve been told I do a mean Louis Armstrong impression), but if I did I sure as heck wouldn&#39;t want to be &quot;represented&quot; by such a scummy organisation. Hopefully with The Internets more people will be able to do without signing their souls over to an RIAA member label that&#39;ll use the funds to extort customers out of more money in frivolous lawsuits than BP is being asked for in response to the latest environmental catastrophe.</p>
<p>How can one feel cautiously hopeful, yet so pessimistic at the same time?</p>
