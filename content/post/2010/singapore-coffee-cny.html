<p><a href="http://www.starbucks.com.sg/">Starbucks</a> have released a <a href="http://www.starbucks.com.sg/downloads/CNY%20Ops%20Hours%20-%20Singapore%202010.pdf">PDF of their opening hours</a> during the Chinese New Year long weekend. Their branches at Liat Towers, Pacific Plaza, Plaza Singapura (with the exception of Tuesday), Raffles City, Northpoint and all the airport terminals are still open 24 hours. All the branches in the CBD around Raffles Place are completely closed.</p>
<p>No word at all on the <a href="http://www.coffeebean.com.sg/">Coffee Bean&#39;s website</a> whether they&#39;re open or not. <a href="http://www.killiney-kopitiam.com/">Killiney Kopitiam</a> seems to be closed from the ones I&#39;ve been to.</p>
<p>This has been a public service announcement from the Rub√©nerd.com Coffee Obsessors Association, Pte Ltd, Pty Ltd, GmBH, Sdn Bhd, LLLLLLLP.</p>
