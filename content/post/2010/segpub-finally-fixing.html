<p>Finally some good news from Segpub regarding the timeouts and slow response times (3 minutes, 38 seconds for a plain HTML file?!) that have been sporadically plaguing my poor sites <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/segpub-downtime/">for months</a>. From a mailing list email addressed to folks on my server:</p>
<blockquote><p>The issues with <strong>[your server]</strong> unfortunately are related to search bots and a mix of other nasty traffic. Weâ€™re working really hard to get ontop <strong>[sic]</strong> of these and are pretty close to having everything resolved and back to normal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nasty traffic? That&#39;s not a nice thing to call my <a href="//rubenerd.com/nonsense/">Nonsense</a> section! ;).</p>
<p>The problem is, because my sites slowed down to a crawl but still eventually loaded, they don&#39;t count these problems as downtime which means they won&#39;t be providing me any free months as stipulated in their uptime guarantee. Sneaky.</p>
