<p>Quite a big swing against Labor, but looks like they&#39;re back for another term in <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2010/">South Australia</a>, the outcome is less clear for <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/elections/tas/2010/">Tasmania</a>. And to think just a few years ago even the Singapore news was awash of Labor&#39;s federal win, I wonder what the results would be if there were a national election tomorrow?</p>
<p>I was pleased with Labor&#39;s win over the Libs in the state and federal elections last time, but this <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/tag/openinternet/">internet filtering</a> and <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/tag/michael-atkinson/">Michael Atkinson nonsense</a> leaves me somewhat disappointed. Then again, what would the alternative be? :(</p>
<p>Discussion about the #octopusbattle will be undertaken tomorrow as I have already blogged far too much this evening. Good night.</p>
