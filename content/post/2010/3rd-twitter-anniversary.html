<p>According to <a href="http://twitter.com/sing_twop_1000/status/10262039212">@sing<em>twop</em>1000</a> who informed me this afternoon, I&#39;ve <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenerd/">been using Twitter</a> now for three years. That&#39;s a good thingâ€¦ right?!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>Trawling through the <a href="//rubenerd.com/archive/">archives</a> here, the first time I mentioned Twitter was <a href="//rubenerd.com/all-work-and-no-play-makes-ruben-need-coffee/">this post</a> published in June 2007 about another international move and my mum. As was my style at the time I talked about many different things in one post, ironically I hadn&#39;t done that for ages until recently!</p>
<p>The screenshot above was the first I took of a Twitter client, from <a href="//rubenerd.com/rubenerd-sunday-random-images/">this post</a> in October 2007 when I was talking about my mum&#39;s ICU scare and some random crappy photos from around Singapore with my then new Nokia e61i phone thingy. I used Twitteriffic right up until they started putting ads into the software and charging for it.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> Oh and Michael Atkinson, my mum was having chemotherapy NOT playing computer games. Go step on a pine cone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Twitter has become such a critical part of my life, I get nearly all my news through it and for an awkward, introverted person like me it&#39;s been a great way to meet people and make friends. I may be programming late at night by myself in the dark, but I have all these friendly people asking how I&#39;m going just a click away. People say they don&#39;t get Twitter, that it&#39;s stupid and it drives them crazy, for me it may have <strong>prevented</strong> me from going crazy.</p>
<p>Cheers Twitter, I&#39;ll have a coffee for both of us :).</p>
