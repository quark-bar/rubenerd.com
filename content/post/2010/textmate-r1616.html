<p>If you&#39;re a <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> user like moi, you&#39;re eyes aren&#39;t decieving you, revision 1616 was pushed through this morning! I&#39;d almost forgotten what the software update window looked like in this app!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>Ch… ch… ch… changes</h3>
<p>If you update you&#39;ll get the full list of changes, but these in particular had me jumping up and down with delight:</p>
<blockquote><p>[NEW] Included Make bundle among the default bundles.</p>
<p>[FIXED] Solved problem with broken application after software update. Ticket D8B9A720.</p>
<p>[CHANGED] Change next/previous file tab key equivalents to shift command [ and ]. This has become the de facto standard.</p>
<p>[FIXED] On Snow Leopard TextMate should no longer lose last used folder for Save As. Ticket FEE58154.</p></blockquote>
<h3>That’s pretty freaky Bowie</h3>
<p>Funnily enough, the last major update was <strong>also</strong> in November, in 2009. And no, the irony didn&#39;t escape me that I&#39;m making a joke about updates considering November has been the quiestest month on this site in years. I&#39;ve been busy! Super busy! Super freak! Wait, that&#39;s Rick James, not David Bowie. Or Major Tom.</p>
<p>In my personal and completely umbiased opinion, Vim/Cream/MacVim is great for editing all kinds of configuration files and scripts, NetBeans is suited for those large and unwieldly Java projects which fortunately I&#39;ve been spared from lately, and TextMate with the right bundles and tmproj&#39;s is simply superb for small to medium projects.</p>
<p>As I&#39;ve said before, I&#39;ve also started using and appreciating <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/">gedit</a> when I&#39;m on my Fedora ThinkPad or my FreeBSD tower, but I don&#39;t admit to that. Serious geek cred would be lost. Right?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and I… cough… still use the IBM E Editor in DOSBox with Steve Gibson&#39;s provided syntax highlighting app in AUTOEXEC.BAT. Feel free to start wailing on me with bats now.</p>
