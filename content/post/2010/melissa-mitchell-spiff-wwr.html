<strong>Jim:</strong> Yeah, we encourage it!<br />
<strong>Spiff:</strong> Really?! Man I love this f*cking place!</p></blockquote>
<p>A heads up in case you&#39;ve forgotten, the <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Melissa_Mitchell_and_Spiff_House_Concert_2010">Melissa Mitchell and Spiff house concert at Whole Wheat Radio</a> will be starting 20:00 Alaska time, which <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?month=02&amp;day=26&amp;year=2010&amp;hour=20&amp;min=00&amp;sec=&amp;p1=18">translates</a> to 13:00 Singapore and 15:30 Aussie Central Daylight Whatsit.</p>
<p>Recently I wanted to ask my dad if he&#39;d got his new bicycle frame yet, but I didn&#39;t want to confuse him into thinking I was talking about his motorbike &#8212; which he also owns but needs some repairs &#8212; so I asked about his <strong>acoustic bike</strong>. Allegedly he&#39;s still telling his friends about his dopey son :D.</p>
<p>Anyway I&#39;m frantically off down the road to get a cup of coffee before it starts!</p>
