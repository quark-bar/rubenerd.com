<p><a href="http://twitter.com/HawkGeminus/status/9723932473">@HawkGeminus</a> has just put the finishing touches on the main page for <a href="http://GrowUpAustralia.com/">GrowUpAustralia.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>What comes as a shock to many is that Australia is the only developed country without an R18+ rating for video games. Films, which fall under the same classification system, can be granted an R18+ or even X18+ rating but this is not the case for computer and video games. If a game exceeds the MA15+ rating, it is either refused classification or modified to fit within the rating guidelines.</p></blockquote>
<p>The new site, if anything, proves conclusively I&#39;m incapable of competing with professional designers and journalists. Wait, I mean that it proves the Aussie Government plan for a comprehensive filter on websites they arbitrarily deem inappropriate and their refusal to release R18+ games because they don&#39;t think Australian adults are capable of deciding for themselves what&#39;s appropriate, is a complete scam.</p>
<p>As a matter of disclosure (and it&#39;s sad public discourse on the subject renders this necessary at all) I do not play R18+ games, but that doesn&#39;t mean other responsible adults who choose to shouldn&#39;t be allowed. Good heavens, is this a western democracy or aâ€¦ wait, I think I&#39;ll end that thought there.</p>
<p>I could argue the case here (and believe me it could fill several books), but <a href="http://GrowUpAustralia.com/">GrowUpAustralia.com</a> does a better job.</p>
