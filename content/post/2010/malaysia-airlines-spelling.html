<p>This is a public service announcement for people who discuss aviation. It is <strong>&quot;Malaysia Airlines&quot;</strong> and NOT <strong>&quot;Malaysian Airlines&quot;</strong>. Can you tell the difference?</p>
<p>Referring to it as Malaysian Airlines on your website doesn&#39;t do much for your aviation credibility, especially considering the <strong>correct spelling is in the logo</strong>! Ditto for Qantas. Don&#39;t worry, even high profile sites like <a href="http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/articles/articles-news/malaysian-airlines-accc-1350.html">Dynamic Business Australia</a> are guilty of it.</p>
