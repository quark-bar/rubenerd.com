<p>Look out world, I&#39;ll be blogging more nonsense again!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>This title is the bongly bongly deng diggy diggy</h3>
<p>Having lived with tethered internet and one of those misleadingly titled Open Network dongles, this morning our new modem arrived. We connected it up andâ€¦ <strong>we have DSL!</strong> After a two month hiatus, we&#39;ve now returned to the 21st century.</p>
<p>Given our home line is with Optus we went with them for the DSL, but we paid a larger deposit (or whatever it was) so we&#39;re not locked into a contract. Our attempts to have service provisioned with Internode and TPG were fruitless, but mysteriously Optus had us online within two days.</p>

Maybe I need to get a bloke called Andrew or Alex to explain this! In Singapore we always had direct cable so all this reseller stuff is foreign and weird and strange and all that.</p>
<h3>Your strange national customs confuse me</h3>
<p>Maybe we&#39;ll churn after this billing month (a term I just learned, makes it sound like your ISP has stomach problems), but for now we&#39;re just glad to have <strong>something</strong>! Once again I can blog nonsense on a more regular basis ^_^.</p>
<p>For those interested or who have nothing better to do, I first discussed the problems with provisioning internet at this address back on the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/aussie-internet-provisioning-provisions/">14th of September</a>. We&#39;d been trying since August.</p>
