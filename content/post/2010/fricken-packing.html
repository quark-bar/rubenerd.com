<p>My old man told us the packers would be here today. They arrived yesterday. D&#39;oh! This is our seventh massive family move thing. I love travelling and living in many different places, but packing <strong>sucks</strong>. Fortunately we&#39;ve got rid of so much stuff, this is the first time we have less stuff than what we had before. It&#39;s also our first family move since mummy passed on, which has been really fricken hard. I found it harder going through her stuff <strong>now</strong> than I did when we were choosing clothes for her funeral, which makes no fricken sense.</p>
<p>That has to be the most fractured paragraph I&#39;ve ever written here. My writing sucks, but that was even worse than usual. Fricken is such a fricken awesome word. Fricken heck.</p>
