<p>I love the <a href="http://links.sourceforge.net/">Links</a> text web browser and have been using it on FreeBSD, Linux and OS X shells, terminals and whatnot for years but I&#39;ve never once felt the need to customise any builds because it Just Works&reg; so gosh darn well. Checking out the variants (<code>-v</code>) for the <a href="http://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/www/links/Portfile">Links port</a> in <a href="http://macports.org/">MacPorts</a> on a whim I noticed something interesting:</p>
<pre>
links has the variants:
   universal: Build for multiple architectures
   gcs: Grilled cheese sandwich headers
   x11: Include X11 interface
</pre>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>Aside from the one obviously fabricated option (universal), the thing that caught my eye was X11. Being a curses application (I think) it didn’t strike me as intuitively obvious how an X11 interface would work, but it piqued my interest and it was a Saturday night so anything goes!</p>
<p>Entering <code>links</code> (then cursing, entering <code>rehash</code> and entering <code>links</code> again, one downside to <a href="http://www.tcsh.org/">tcsh</a>!) I got the bog standard curses links interface I was used to, but consulting the man page there is a flag for graphical mode:</p>
<pre>
<strong>-g</strong>
Run Links in graphics mode. If not given, Links will run in text mode.   

Running in graphics mode means that Links will probe all compiled-in graphics devices and run on the first found. If none found, links  will not run in text mode. This option works only if <strong>--enable-graphics</strong> was given to <strong>./configure</strong>.

<strong>-no-g</strong>
Run in text mode (overrides previous <strong>-g</strong>).
</pre>
<h3>And it works!</h3>
<p>And it works! <strong>I just said that.</strong> Of course if you&#39;d been to their <a href="http://links.sourceforge.net/">home page</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(web_browser)">Wikipedia</a> recently you&#39;d know this, but as I said at the beginning I&#39;d never felt the need to.</p>
<p>What&#39;s really amazing is Links 2.0 with it&#39;s new graphics stack can (depending on the system) even display graphics on terminals without X! The layout of pages is a bit iffy, but I&#39;ve got to admit that&#39;s gosh darn impressive.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be sticking to using links in it&#39;s capacity as a lightning fast, easy to use text based browser, but it&#39;s been a fun experience, especially with this half pint glass of Kilkenny poured from one of those cans with the widgets. As I say, I have wild Saturday nights.</p>

<h3>Why not Lynx or eLinks?</h3>
<p>Because links is a delicious pun, having one big cat on my Mac is enough, and elinks imposes its own colour scheme over my carefully chosen Terminal colours of which I’m rather partial.</p>
