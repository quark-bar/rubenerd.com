<p>I think Google Reader is punishing me for perennially having (1000+) unread items! I like that word, perennially. Not really appropriate for this discussion as blog feeds don&#39;t grow. Or do they?</p>
<p>This morning the site reported I had unread items, even when I went through and read them all. This means I&#39;m seeing the same stories being reported as new, despite having already read them!</p>
<p>Has anyone else been having this problem? Given this is Google I&#39;m fairly confident it&#39;d be fixed in a few hours, knowing me I&#39;m just an anomaly in their database that&#39;s wrecking havoc or something. I have that effect on people, you see.</p>
