<p>There are at least five things wrong with that picture. The most glaring thing isâ€¦ there&#39;s an Outback Steakhouse in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=14974386353956271599&amp;q=Millenia+Walk">Millenia Walk</a> [sic] in Singapore, and it has American flags outside. Then again that could be a mistake on the restaurant&#39;s part, in which case there&#39;s nothing wrong with this picture whatsoever. </p>
<p>Photo from <a href="http://www.freakingnews.com/Uluru-Sydney-Opera-House-Pics-43748.asp">FreakingNews.com</a>. Another photo and site for which I have no recollection on how I found it. Like a boss, most likely.</p>
