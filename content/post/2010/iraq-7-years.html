<p>This time last week was the seventh anniversary of the illegal coalition invasion of Iraq. I was 16 at the time and in my school&#39;s canteen in Singapore when I first heard the news. I couldn&#39;t believe it, and now with the death toll in the hundreds of thousands and no end in sight I still can&#39;t. It&#39;s as if my mind simply can&#39;t comprehend the numbers or the reasons, so it just shuts off.</p>
<p>There&#39;s so much good in the world, it&#39;s just you need to trudge through and push aside a dismally vast amount of awful stuff and people to get to it. People who don&#39;t learn from history. People with an overinflated sense of their own intelligence, entitlement and warped morality. What a waste, and a crying shame :(.</p>
