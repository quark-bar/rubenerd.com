<p>Decided to archive this news graphic here for posterity, might be funny to look back on in a few years. Was lifted from the <a href="http://abc.net.au/news/">ABC News</a> website on the 25th, I&#39;m assuming as a product of a publicly funded company I have permission to use it here, or barring that there&#39;s some fair use clause in there somewhere.</p>
<p>Sheesh, I feel as though I need to drop economics as my minor and take legal studies instead. Copyright is perhaps one of the few things more broken than DRM and my old sandals.</p>
