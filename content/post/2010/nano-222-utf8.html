<p>Running the <code>./configure</code> script from the latest <a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/">nano</a> tarball on a virgin Snow Leopard machine (my dad&#39;s) I keep running into a problem with UTF-8 support.</p>
<blockquote style="font-family:monospace"><p>Using ncurses as the curses library<br />
checking for use_default_colors in -lncursesâ€¦ yes<br />
configure: error:</p>
<p>UTF-8 support was requested, but insufficient UTF-8 support was detected in your curses and/or C libraries.  Please verify that your slang was built with UTF-8 support or your curses was built with wide character support, and that your C library was built with wide character support.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve built the latest ncurses and slang libraries from MacPorts and have confirmed they were built with UTF-8 support. Only thing I can think of is it&#39;s using the outdated ncurses from the system instead of MacPorts, but other ports such as Midnight Commander are using it. Will keep digging.</p>
<p>For what it&#39;s worth, it builds just fine without UTF-8, but it&#39;s a feature I&#39;d rather have.</p>
