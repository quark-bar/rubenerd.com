<p>In response to the continual antics of Zuckerberg and Co, today was the <strong>International Kill Your Facebook Day</strong> (or variations upon that theme).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have such tenuous link with so many people I still need my account, though today I took the opportunity to scrub it of all my information other than my name and a fake religion called &quot;fake-account-ism&quot;. I&#39;m still one of Zuckerbergs pawns, but at least I&#39;m no good to the third parties that cut his cheques. Well, <strong>less</strong> good, at least now they&#39;d have to trawl their database looking for items people <strong>think</strong> they deleted but were just stored somewhere else or with a different database flag.</p>
<h3>Its a reality check</h3>
<p>Reading books such as Hoodwinked you could be forgiven for thinking the people of my generation are more ethical and have more of a desire to good socially and for the environment than previous generations. I suppose Zuckerberg is a splash of cold water and a solid reality check on this view. There are people of every generation who&#39;s motivation is <a title="Business Insider: Well, These New Zuckerberg IMs Won't Help Facebook's Privacy Problems" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/well-these-new-zuckerberg-ims-wont-help-facebooks-privacy-problems-2010-5">profit above people</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s hoping <a href="http://www.joindiaspora.com/">Diaspora</a> or another similar project can do to Facebook what Facebook did to MySpace.</p>
<h3>The Whole Wheat Factor</h3>
<p>Of course I&#39;m also a hypocrite, as Jim Kloss pointed out this morning my time:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks for adding the <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/wholewheatradio/">Whole Wheat Radio Player</a> Ruben. We both made compromises. I wrote the unbelievably contorted code to add a simple link to Facebook profiles and you logged onto FB. ;-) &#8212;Jim</p></blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s right, of course! In my defence, I figure the information from this widget is in the WWR community silo and not Facebook, and unlike most widget developers I trust Jim :).</p>
<p>For those who don&#39;t know, <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/">Whole Wheat Radio</a> is an internet radio station and community wiki showcasing entirely independent music.</p>
