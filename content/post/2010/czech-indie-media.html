<blockquote><p>In [the] Czech Republic you actually have to pay OSA (they collect money for music usage) if you want to publish your own work (they actually claim that they will return you 70% of that if you sign with them).</p></blockquote>
<p>Does anyone know if <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1699440&#038;cid=32702500">this is true</a>? If it is, I wonder how many Czech internet users are breaking the law with their podcasts? Another case of technology always being two [hundred] steps ahead of the law.</p>
<p>My dad, sis and I went to Plze≈à in the Czech Republic in January. Some really beautiful old buildings and great food. Good thing I didn&#39;t attempt to publish any of the audio I recorded while I was there!</p>
