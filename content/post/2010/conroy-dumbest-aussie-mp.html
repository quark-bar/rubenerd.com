<p>We all suspected as much, but <a href="http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/breaking-news/zoo-weekly-dubs-stephen-conroy-dumbest-mp/story-e6frg12u-1225899711652">now it&#39;s official</a>: the readers of (uh, Zoo Weekly) have dubbed Stephen Conroy the dumbest politician in Australia.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>It’s all them portal things</h3>
<p>For those not in Australia, the illustrious Stephen Conroy is the senator who wants to implement a nationwide, mandatory internet filter based on a super secret blacklist, regardless of the technological infeasibility, negative social implications and other such quibbling factors of which I&#39;ve discussed <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/openinternet/">at great length</a>. If he wasn&#39;t taught at the Ted Stevens school of understanding the intertubes, he at least received some free coaching one afternoon from the man over some cheap alcoholic beverages.</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;There’s a staggering number of Australians being in having their computers infected at the moment, up to 20,000, uh, can regularly be getting infected by these spams, or scams, that come through, the portal (sic).&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>Unlike other esteemed survey organisations such as Newspoll, Zoo Weekly is uniquely positioned to gauge the sentiment of the Australian public on the societal impact of technology. Their exposes on how much photoshopping one poor model in a bikini can endure are featured on the front covers of their magazines each week.</p>
<h3>Runners up</h3>
<p>As a runner up, I thought Richard Dawkins&#39; description of the Orwellian-ly titled Family First party leader Steven Fielding was particularly apt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Runner up in the Zoo survey was Family First Senator Steve Fielding, who has been described as having the intellect of an earthworm by eminent scientist Richard Dawkins, after saying he thought the earth was less than 10,000 years old.</p></blockquote>
<p>I dunno, earthworms can navigate with their eyes closed. Still, I do <a href="https://twitter.com/fakefielding">follow him on Twitter</a>.</p>
