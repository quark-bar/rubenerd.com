<p>I was puzzled when <a href="http://www.intoyourheadpodcast.com/aaaapodcastblog/">Neal O&#39;Carroll</a> insinuated in the comments for a recent post that he&#39;d used the <strong>Buy Ruben a Coffee</strong> button on my blog sidebar. PayPal didn&#39;t &#8212; and still hasn&#39;t &#8212; emailed me any record of this taking place.</p>
<p>Anyway I would like to sheepishly admit with a deep crimson face that Neal <strong>did indeed</strong> hit that <strong>Buy Ruben a Coffee</strong> button, it just appeared in my PayPal account, and I wanted to thank him for keeping this weirdo caffeine-d up for another day. Thank you good sir :).</p>
