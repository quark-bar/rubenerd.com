<p>For those of you wondering what&#39;s been up with my uncharacteristically long break from tweeting and blogging (still don&#39;t like that word much), I&#39;ve spent the better part of a week helping my old man organise this giant mess of boxes we call a self storage room and an apartment we only moved into <a href="http://rubenerd.com/unpacking-singapore-day-one/">back in 2007</a>.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve been making a lot of tough decisions and getting rid of stuff we don&#39;t need. It&#39;s a cliche but accurate observation that for far too long possessions have owned us, instead of the other way around.</p>
<p>Still got all my late mum&#39;s stuff to go through too. I thought I was strong enough to, but apparently I&#39;m not. Fortunately my sister is a dynamo.</p>
