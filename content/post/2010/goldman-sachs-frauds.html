<p>From the <em>We Could Have Told Them That</em> department, the reprehensible management at  Goldman Sachs have been found guilty of fraud by the American Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>What I want to know has nothing to do with the crooked economics behind deregulation so championed by Milton Friedman and his cronies, but why this  decision was reached in civil and not criminal court. These people destroyed the lives of millions, they should be in prison. Sincerely, I weep for their victims.</p>
