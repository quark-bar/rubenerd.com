<p>Hey, when I saw these two stories in my sleep induced state early this morning it made my smile ;).</p>
<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;ve never personally called women birds, but I&#39;ve heard it a lot. I thought it was an Aussie euphemism, but <a href="http://jessie-thenewpurple.blogspot.com/2009/03/why-do-men-call-women-birds.html">Jesse Lloyd</a> says it&#39;s a British thing. I guess she would know, being a bird and all!</p>
