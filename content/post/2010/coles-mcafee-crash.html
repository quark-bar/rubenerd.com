<p><a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/coles-closes-stores-due-to-mcafee-bug-339302629.htm?omnRef=NULL">ZDNet Australia is reporting</a> on yet another bug caused by terminals running anti-virus software on a consumer level operating system instead of using a more efficient and secure embedded system that wouldn&#39;t need such code running in the first place.</p>

<blockquote><p>Australian supermarket behemoth Coles was today hit by a McAfee bug that affected 10 per cent of its point of sales terminals and forced it to shut down stores in both WA and South Australia.</p></blockquote>
<p>While this would have been terrible for business and a huge inconvenience for customers, somehow I feel better knowing they were <strong>software</strong> bugs and not some creepy crawlies that closed them down. Software bugs are much more hygienic, unless they&#39;re messing with QC I suppose.</p>
<p>That reminds me, I need to do my belated review of Windows Security Essentials at some point too. It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve had something positive to say about a Microsoft product that it took me quite by surprise.  This still doesn&#39;t mean that Windows should be used on sales terminals and other such devices though, what a terrible idea. It hurts my brain in an excruciating way.</p>
