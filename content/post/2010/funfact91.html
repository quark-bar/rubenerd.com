<p>Here&#39;s another <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/fun-facts/">Rubenerd Fun Fact</a> for all you rabid Official Rub√©nerd Fun Fact fans. I know you&#39;re out there, I can hear you furrowing your brows and sighing.</p>
<blockquote><p>R18+ games are designated as such for the pirate sound one makes when pronouncing it.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is my own personal contribution to the debate <a href="http://notgamers.net/general/rants/dear-irresponsible-lazy-parents-of-australia">started by NotGamers.net</a>. Don&#39;t let the name fool you, despite claiming they lied, they&#39;re not gamers. Unless they are.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
