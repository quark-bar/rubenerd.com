<p>Some civil liberty groups are championing the news that Senator Conroy&#39;s plan to filter Australian internet has been put &quot;on hold&quot;, but personally I&#39;m still just as jaded and pessimistic as I was before. Conroy and his cronies haven&#39;t said they&#39;re scrapping it which is the only sensible thing to do, they&#39;ve simply pushed it to a time after the federal elections to spare themselves some embarrassment.</p>
<p>While we&#39;re also talking about this, <a href="http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/352667/barnaby_joyce_gets_behind_an_isp_filter/">David Ramli of ARNNET is reporting</a> that it seems Nationals senator Barnaby Joyce has also put his support behind the mandatory filter which leads us to one very important question: can we all stop calling Barnaby Joyce a maverick, rouge, super elite senator please? Yes he&#39;s taken issue with a few things the coalition have proposed in the past, but reading these descriptions at the start of every single story about him starting to get a little long in the tooth.</p>
