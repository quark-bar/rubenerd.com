<p>Having fun with <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> on <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/libretto/">my Libretto</a> this afternoon, I didn&#39;t have internet access to install <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> from ports so I decided to finally learn more about the bundled <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=nvi">nvi editor</a>. I missed syntax highlighting, but if you customise it right it&#39;s still a nice, lightweight, capable editor.</p>

<h3>Theyâ€™re similar, sort of, in some ways, kinda</h3>
<p>Because Vim and nvi are both implementations of the classic vi/ex they have a number of functional similarities, but because nvi has been essentially static for licencing reasons in the BSDs and given Vim&#39;s continuous and rapid development, the gap between the two editors has been widening for quite some time. That was a needlessly long sentence.</p>
<p>Historians with complex flowcharts showing the origins of software would faint in horror at this assertion, but I like to think of nvi as a sort of &quot;Vim-lite&quot;. In that context I don&#39;t fret about lost features, I just learn what they have in common and work with it, just like a guy with a scooter doesn&#39;t expect it to perform the same as his dad&#39;s Ducati. Does that make sense?</p>

<h3>Configuration philes</h3>
<p>Unlike Vim&#39;s <code>~/.vimrc</code>, Nvi reads from the historically named <code>~/.nexrc</code> file.</p>
<p>I like to include plenty of comments in my dotfiles, but as I learned from trial and error (and error, and error!) nvi is more picky about what you can include. You can&#39;t place comments on the same line as settings, and if you include a blank line anything below it is ignored!</p>
<p>This is part of my <code>~/.nexrc</code> file, you can check out the full version on <a href="http://rubenschade.com/dotfiles/">my dotfiles site</a> if you&#39;re interested.</p>

<h3>Why not just install Vim Ruben? Gosh!</h3>
<p>Even if the first thing you do on a fresh system is install <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, <a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/">nano</a> or another editor, because nvi is distributed with all the major BSDs by default it&#39;s a great idea to have a working knowledge of it. It&#39;s like a dependable friend :).</p>
