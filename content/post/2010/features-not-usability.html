<p>I don&#39;t know how <a href="http://www.itechnews.net/2006/04/05/t-pod-neo-ipod-nano-like-mp3-player/">I ended up at this review site</a>, but I was less surprised by the fact the unit they were discussing was so shamelessly ripping off the iPod (right down to the headphones), but rather the reviewer actually <strong>liked</strong> it. Were they wearing those beer glasses Bart Simpson tried on?</p>

<blockquote><p>The T-Pod neo is the mix of iPod nano and MPio HD400, but it may be better than both of them. T-Pod neo features a 1.5-inch LCD screen, MP3/WMA Music playback and MTV/AMX Video playback and there are 1GB and 2GB models.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suppose it goes to show some people can simply be won over with feature lists instead of usability, creativity and industrial design. Come to think of it, that explains a substantial part of the tech industry; for example how could a CNET writer <a href="http://news.cnet.com/2300-1041_3-6245761-4.html">honestly write that this device</a> is reminiscent of the iPhone interface?</p>
<p>As for the specific assertion the T-Pod is better than the iPod: perhaps we&#39;re at an unfair advantage with hindsight, but I don&#39;t think it surprises any of us that it didn&#39;t really get anywhere, even if it does sound vaguely like the A-Team would be blasting tunes from it.</p>
