<p>This morning&#39;s intermittent Rubénerd outages were brought to you by <a href="http://segpub.com.au/">Segment Publishing</a>. They&#39;re still miles better than <a href="//rubenerd.com/bye-servage/">Servage</a> was, though that isn&#39;t saying much.</p>
<p>Curiously, <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/segpub-downtime/">many of the outages</a> over the last year have been around this time of day. I wonder if they do server maintenance around 00:00-02:00 Adelaide time, or whether it&#39;s due to increased loads given it&#39;s daylight in the US.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Іt&#39;s now 10:42 and pages are still taking many long minutes to render. Time to move web hosts again?</p>
