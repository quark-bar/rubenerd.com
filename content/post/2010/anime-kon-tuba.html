<p>In case you needed <a href="http://twitter.com/cowboybibimbop/status/10371806363">another reason</a> to obsess over the up and coming second season of the moe-blob-but-still-awesome music anime <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/k-on/">K-On</a>, there&#39;s going to be a new character called Miura Akane-chan.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>She&#39;s going to be 172cm tall which would make her tower even over <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/akiyama-mio/">Mio</a>, and get this: she&#39;s going to play the <strong>tuba</strong>! I&#39;m really interested to see how they fit a <strong>tuba</strong> into a pop band, I mean, it&#39;s a gigantic <strong>tuba</strong>! A… <strong>tuba</strong>!? It probably weighs more than she does! Wait, hold on, let me see if I&#39;ve got this straight: a… <strong>tuba</strong>!?</p>
<p>To tell the truth, if they were going to introduce a new character I would have been more excited if he was a guy, someone like Kyon to be mock horrified at their afternoon tea and complain they never get any work done. ;).</p>
<h3>Wait, what? A… tuba!?</h3>
<p>That reminds me, I only got up to watching episode 08, and I only <a href="//rubenerd.com/anime-k-on-06/">blogged up to episode 06</a>. I&#39;d better rectify this before someone with a tuba comes along. A… <strong>tuba</strong>!?</p>
<p>While I think of it, she also reminds me of someone, but I can&#39;t quite put my finger on who. Well I suppose that&#39;s a good thing, otherwise I&#39;d be arrested.</p>
