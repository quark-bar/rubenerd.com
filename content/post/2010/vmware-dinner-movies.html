<p>This afternoon I chanced upon an email from the folks at <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>For a limited time, get unparalleled reliability for less than $10 and spend the $40 you save on dinner and a movie instead.</p></blockquote>
<p>While their offer of a $10 upgrade from Fusion is incredibly enticing, I would suggest they reconsider their assertion that we could spend the money on <em>&quot;dinner and a movie&quot;</em> instead. <strong>That would imply nerds like me can get a date!</strong> Clever use of the term &quot;unparalleled&quot; to have a little dig at their <a href="http://www.parallels.com/">competitor</a> though, I&#39;ll give them that.</p>
