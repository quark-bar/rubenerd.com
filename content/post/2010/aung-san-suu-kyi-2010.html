<p>This has nothing to do with tech, and I&#39;m supposed to be studying right now, but <a title="Wikipedia: Aung San Suu Kyi 2010 release" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi#2010_release">this news</a> made me choke up.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi#2010_release"><p>On the evening of 13 November 2010, Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest. This was the date her detention had been set to expire according to a court ruling in August 2009. She appeared in front of a crowd of her supporters, who rushed to her house in Rangoon when nearby barricades were removed by the security forces. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate had been detained for 15 of the past 21 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m still pessimistic about Burma&#39;s future. ASEAN will continue to <a title="Wikipedia: Criticism of ASEAN" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/ASEAN#Criticism">rest on their laurels</a> and no doubt the junta will throw her back into domestic exile as soon as they can concoct another excuse, but for now this is fantastic news.</p>
