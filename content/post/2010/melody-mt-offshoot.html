<p>For many years now WordPress has been the iPhone of blogging tools: every other platform is judged by how well it compares to it, and unless you have a specific need that isn&#39;t served by it, it gets chosen almost as the default. Here&#39;s hoping this <a href="http://openmelody.org/">brand new offshoot</a> of Movable Type brings back some solid competition. And I didn&#39;t even make a terrible musical pun in the title, I was tempted though.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://openmelody.org/about/"><p>Melody is an open source content management and publishing system derived from the popular blogging tool Movable Type. Melody is for those who find value in belonging to, supporting and contributing to a community of helpful, passionate and devoted users, but it is also for people who want a secure, proven and high quality publishing environment for their personal web site or their business.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m firing up git now and getting myself a copy to mess around with :).</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/melodyvalentine.png" alt="Melody Valentine from Archie Comics" style="height:427px; width:140px; background:transparent; padding:0; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" /> Back when I used to be a <a href="http://perl.org/">Perl golfer</a> Movable Type really intrigued me, and over the years I kept installing it in my local sandbox to play around with it. I love the way static pages are generated instead of calling a database every single time a page is loaded, and the administrative interface is the best in the business.</p>
<p>You can also host multiple blogs with the one software installation like TextPattern and B2evolution, something the <strong>base</strong> WordPress software has been sorely lacking for far too long (WordPress mu is far too big for just two or three blogs, and Wp-hive has never worked for me). I&#39;m assuming Melody would retain these features.</p>
<h3>You talked the talk, why didnâ€™t you walk the walk?</h3>
<p>The reasons why I never deployed it were a combination of the &quot;good enough syndrome&quot; with WordPress, the added complexity of installing it properly (it&#39;s a CGI app) and the sheer number of files it contained. I mean it, Movable Type is <strong>huge!</strong> If Melody polishes it up, they could have a real winner on their hands and I&#39;d <strong>seriously</strong> consider switching.</p>
<p>I have to be honest, I&#39;ve never been very happy with WordPress; their security record leaves a lot to be desired, it took them them far too long to adopt tags (during which time we had to use <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/simpletagged/">third party extensions</a>) and their comment system is also a bit lacking, so much so that people are resorting to putting horrible external JavaScript on their pages (cue the collective groan of security and accessibility experts) to dynamically load services like Disqus.</p>
<p>The term feature-creep is often used as a defense for not adding such increasingly important features, and I admit to being a fan of software minimalism, but if they don&#39;t do more to bring WP into 2010 they could end up being left behind. Surely there&#39;s a happy medium between the two.</p>
