<p>I&#39;m not really into sport, but Germany were amazing again tonight. 4-0 against Australia, 4-1 against England and 4-0 against Argentina. We agreed on Twitter that Germany may not be the most artistic side, but they&#39;re amazing team players and have the best defence. <a href="http://twitter.com/tylermassey/status/17656049900">@TylerMassey</a> put it best:</p>
<blockquote><p>#arg Argentina look increasingly frantic and #ger Germany have stayed calm. SO patient. Careful, well-researched German football. Not flashy. Clever.</p></blockquote>
<p>My dad and half my family are German :)</p>
