<p>Speaking of <a href="//rubenerd.com/photos-singapore-deserted/">photos in Singapore</a>, here&#39;s one I also took this afternoon of the brand spanking new apartment building outside me bedroom window here. When I was in Singapore in January last year it wasn&#39;t there, now just over a year later it&#39;s finished! It took them longer for the people next door to us in Adelaide to build a semi detatched one story house!</p>
<p>The colours seem a bit over-saturated, but I did very little post production other than converting from RAW. And no, I didn&#39;t build the building.</p>
