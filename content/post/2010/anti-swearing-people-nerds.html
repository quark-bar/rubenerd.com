<p>Watching an old episode of <a href="http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/about.do">Penn and Teller Bullshit</a> last night on how some people claim swearing is &quot;destroying society&quot;, I briefly noticed this sign in the office of one of the proponents.</p>
<p>What&#39;s wrong with nerds!? Are we too sarcastic perhaps? I&#39;m never sarcastic.</p>
<p>For those not in the know, nerds (as in Ruben-nerd) are geeks without social skills. Perhaps she&#39;s just afraid of us then.</p>
