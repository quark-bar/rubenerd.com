<p>Despite what seemed like a heartening tide against services like Disqus, they&#39;re enjoying a baffling resurgence. I asked myself, why would people voluntarily make their sites slower, more convoluted for <a href="http://noscript.net/">security conscious</a> people to use, as well as less accessible, searchable, cohesive, secure and predictable? I did a bit of digging, and discovered something shocking.</p>
<p><a href="http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Crab_People">Crab people</a>. They taste like crab, talk like people, and they live underground.</p>
<p>Crab people are installing third party comment systems on as many blogs as they can by convincing people they&#39;re shiny and awesome. Once installed on a critical mass, they&#39;ll be able to control the blogs remotely using an undisclosed back door in the proprietary code and take back the world the Humans so cruelly stole from them.</p>
<p>Crab people! Crab people! Taste like crab! Comment like people!</p>
