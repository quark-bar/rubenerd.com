<p>In <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/segpub-finally-fixing/">late April</a>, my webhost SegPub informed me the specific webserver causing problems for my site and the sites of many other people was in the process of being fixed. It&#39;s now almost June and the problems are still persisiting for all of us, if the newsgroups are anything to go by.</p>

<p>Some small comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;Could you *please* keep us in the loop as things progress. The silence on this issue has added to the misery of having sites that are so often unreachable (certainly more than 0.5% of the month).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have 2 site on Chewie and have had endless problems, not the least being NO response to any support ticket ( I’ve lost count how many I have sent). Hopefully things improve sooner rather than later.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alas, the problems seem to be persisting. Once again, [my site] is down, while all of my other SegPub-hosted sites are up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Same here, sites constantly go-slow or time out.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>Peter wrote the best summary:</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;Yes, I’m still seeing persistent slow response from [our server] too. This appears to have started around February 2010.</p>
<p>I opened a support ticket a month ago, sent a reminder after two weeks without a human response, then received the answer &#8220;In regards to the speed issues, we were having some issues with bots flooding [our server] with traffic at sporadic times of the day. We believe we’ve resolved this and you should be seeing the site load at acceptable speeds.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sent copies of my monitor reports, which show that performance is till poor when compared with a site on another host’s shared server.</p>
<p>I have just received a monitor report that the site on [the server] was down for three hours.</p>
<p>Altogether disappointing.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>And as another cruel twist, this post has taken an hour to go live because the site keeps timing out whenever I hit the Publish button. I&#39;ve decided to give them a couple more weeks before I start looking for alternatives to their service.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rootbsd.net/">RootBSD</a> look like a great FreeBSD VPS service, or for the greenie hippie in me there&#39;s always <a href="http://www.greengeeks.com/web-hosting/green-web-hosting.php">Green Geeks</a> that Marco recommended here a while ago :). I tend to get a bit nervous with sites that oversell though, but I&#39;ll check them out.</p>
