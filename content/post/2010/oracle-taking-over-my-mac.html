<p>Don&#39;t look now butâ€¦ I was just looking at my dock before and I realised I use more Oracle software now than Apple software. Don&#39;t worry though, they didn&#39;t force my dock to be horizontal, I only did that so I could take a better screenshot. If you have it on the side, it would have taken up more space.</p>
<p>Does this mean I&#39;m more of a lackey for Ellison than Jobs?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Maybe I <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/28/openoffice_independence_from_oracle/">spoke too soon</a>!</p>
