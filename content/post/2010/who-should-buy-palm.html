<p>I&#39;ve been so <a title="Post: The Great Schade Family House Cleanout 2010" href="http://rubenerd.com/great-schade-family-house-cleanout-2010/">frantically busy</a> with all the scanning and throwing away of junk here I haven&#39;t had the chance to blog for a while, so I figured I&#39;d quickly weigh in with my own proposal for who should buy out Palm. I reckon mine is just as good as any.</p>
