<p>Just grabbed the latest release of Fedora for my adorable ThinkPad X40 from their tracker. Apparently I&#39;m late to the download party though, I&#39;m not seeding for anyone ;).</p>

<h3>The background is the bongily dengy diggy diggy</h3>
<p>For those who don&#39;t know, my MacBook Pro runs Snow Leopard, my primary desktop runs FreeBSD 8.0 RELEASE (used to be -STABLE, but RELEASE works just fine for me now) and my ThinkPad dual-boots FreeDOS and Fedora owing to some stability issues with FreeBSD issues on that hardware, and it works a little better with closed wireless dongle dengy deng diggy diggys. </p>
<p>Why does it also run FreeDOS? Because its the only system that will allow me to run that creaky old software for my giant purple particle accelerator downstairs, <strong>that&#39;s why</strong>. Sorry you asked?</p>
<p>I used to use the Xfce spin, but going back to the default GNOME one for a while. Don&#39;t tell anyone, but I&#39;ve been secretly using Gedit for some stuff, the syntax highlighting is really quite pretty :).</p>
<h3>Why does issues need all those S’s?</h3>
<p>Now apparently certain models of ThinkPads still have suspending issues, which is a problem because having never been suspended from school I&#39;m not sure how to take it. I also hope they fix that nasty GTK graphics bug, for some reason it didn&#39;t affect my desktop when it was installed on it, but my ThinkPad looked downright awful.</p>
<h3>Link arms, don’t make them</h3>
