<p>I haven&#39;t been this dumbfoundedly awestruck in a very, very long time; why I&#39;ve even started making up contractions. NASA has made available some of the first high resolution images and HD videos of the sun taken from the shiny <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/21apr_firstlight/">Solar Dynamics Observatory</a>. If you haven&#39;t checked it out yet, do it <strong>now</strong>, unless you&#39;re in a place where having your jaw drop to the floor might be embarrassing.</p>
<p>I&#39;m so glad to be alive in this period of time, and deeply humbled at the same time. Galileo could have only dreamed of seeing such images.</p>
<p>A big manhug and thanks to <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/10920168535716982098">Ken Jones</a> for sharing this story in Google Reader.</p>
