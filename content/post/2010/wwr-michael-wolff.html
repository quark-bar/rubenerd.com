<p>Continuing in our seven day Whole Wheat Radio Artist of the Day experiment here on Rub√©nerd.com, today&#39;s artist is the awesome jazz pianist and composer <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Artists:Michael_Wolff">Michael Wolff</a>.</p>

<p>I can describe Michael&#39;s jazzy tunes in one word: cool, suave, cool, awesome, sophisticated, cool, swish, cool, fun and <strong>cool</strong>. That was substantially more than one word. Then again so is &quot;Michael Wolff&quot;, so we&#39;ve come out ahead again. All is good with the world!</p>
<p>As with all Whole Wheat Radio artists you can request a show of his songs to be added to the webcast in real time as well as view his artist page where you can leave comments. He also has an <a href="http://www.michaelwolff.com/">official website</a> where you can listen to a few tracks.</p>
<p>I keep trying to branch out of my music comfort zone and try new things, but Michael&#39;s style of music is still by far my favourite and he more than does the genre justice. He is just so friggen <strong>awesome</strong> to listen to! If you can get a more glowing endorsement from a computer nerd who knows nothing about music terminology than that, I haven&#39;t heard it!</p>
