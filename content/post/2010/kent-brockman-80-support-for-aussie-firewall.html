<p>Just when we thought this nonsense couldn&#39;t get any worse, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/communications/soa/80-of-Aussies-support-filter-/0,130061791,339300949,00.htm">ZDNet Australia is reporting</a> 80% of respondents to a phone poll support Labor&#39;s plan for a mandatory internet filter.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>Unfortunately I&#39;m not surprised. Most of the voting public aren&#39;t tech savvy and all the information they&#39;re getting about the plan are from government sound bites and talking points that misleadingly tell them such a plan will protect their kids. Sounds familiar, doesn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>Much like the republican referendum ten years ago, I think the wording of the question is critical in a situation like this. 80% of people may support this proposition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you support a mandatory internet filter?</p>
<p>YES / NO</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what about this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do you support a mandatory internet filter that:</p>
<ul>
<li>is similar to ones in China, Saudi Arabia and North Korea</li>
<li>will slow down internet access</li>
<li>drive IT investment out of the country which will cost jobs</li>
<li>does <strong>not</strong> prevent access to material secretly deemed inappropriate by the government?</li>
</ul>
<p>YES / NO</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve heard the argument that voters don&#39;t like reading long, complicated sentences and are much happier to answer a simple question such as the first one above, but I figure they&#39;ll see big scary North Korea there and change their mind.</p>
<h3>The Brockman Factor</h3>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> Then it is unanimous, we will approve the bill to [defend Australian children against questionable material by creating an internet filter…]</p>
<p><strong>Senator:</strong> Hold on, I’d like to tack on a waiver to that to that bill. [Can we make it mandatory regardless of its effectiveness?]</p>
<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> All those in favour of the amended <strong>mandatory</strong> internet filter say aye? [80% aye! Motion carried.]</p>
<p><strong>Kent Brockman:</strong> I’ve said this before but I’ll say it again: democracy simply doesn’t work.</p>
