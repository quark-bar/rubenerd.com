<p>The <a href="http://www.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/02_41.html">poor Japanese</a>, can&#39;t they live but one month of their lives without having a new Prime Minister thrust upon them? Fortunately I have a solution that I&#39;m confident would work out, and save taxpayer money.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>Firstly…</h3>
<p>I suppose at this point you expect me to make an anime reference, because Japan is where it comes from. Well firstly I&#39;m shocked and appalled that you&#39;d assume I&#39;m so much of a crass simpleton that I&#39;d see places not for what they are but with sweeping, overt generalisations based on one of their recognisable industries.</p>
<p>I mean, do you expect every post I write about Ireland to mention praties floating in Guinness, or every post that mentions Singapore has to mention teh tarik and PCK? <em>Best in Singapore and JB, and some say Batam?</em> Really?!</p>
<h3>And secondly…</h3>
<p>Now that we&#39;ve got that out of the way… we all know Suzumiya Haruhi would make the best Prime Minister.</p>
<p>She has drive, an &quot;unconventional&quot; way of solving problems and getting what she wants, the uncanny ability to make those she despises <strong>very</strong> uncomfortable, and she created the universe so if anyone were to know what makes it tick, it&#39;d be her. And if she should falter she&#39;d be no more or less effective than any of the six previous post holders, and better still she could just change the universe back to what it was before (as she&#39;d rumoured to be doing so her second series never ends up appearing).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, despite being God she couldn&#39;t be the Emperor because of her gender, though as PM she&#39;d wield more legislative power anyway. She could also save the Diet billions over the course of her tenure by having Konata as one of her senior ministers because they&#39;d both be voiced by the one person.</p>
<p>It&#39;s pure, unmitigated genius, feel free to let me know why I&#39;m right. Come to think of it, maybe she should come to Australia given we have no good choices in either major party.</p>
<h3>The First Japanese Suzumiya Cabinet…?</h3>
