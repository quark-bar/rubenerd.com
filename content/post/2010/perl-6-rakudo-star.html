<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env perl -wT
use strict;

&#038;sayWooHoo("again");

sub sayWooHoo {
    print ("Hey, 6 might be coming soon, $_[0]!");
}
</pre>
<p>My first job out of high school was writing Perl programs. Was the happiest time of my life, because university hadn&#39;t crushed my spirit yet. Perl is awesome. CPAN is awesome! And don&#39;t believe what they say, it is possible to write Perl programs that you and others can understand later, provided you <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlstyle.html">follow the conventions</a> :).</p>
