<p>Yup, it&#39;s time for another one of our beloved <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">Rubénerd Pointless Milestones</a>, and this time we&#39;re continuing another fine tradition! I live to write posts like this :)</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>Last year I celebrated the <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/post-id-5700/">reaching of WordPress ID 5700</a> by posting information about the Tennent 5700 industrial scrubber, so it only seems fitting then to keep this silly little tradition we&#39;ve been sharing alive. A <strong>great</strong> idea, or the <strong>greatest</strong> idea of all time?</p>
<h3>Don’t answer that</h3>
<p>To celebrate the auspicious posting of 2800 blog posts, here for your reading delight is information about the fine <a href="http://www.pullman-ermator.se/eng/produkter/sline.html">Pullman Ermantor 5700</a> industrial vaccum cleaner &#8212; no wait, <strong>dust extractor</strong>. Sounds lean, mean and awesome, and it&#39;s shiny in both appearance and Firefly parlance. What is it?</p>
<blockquote><p>A powerful two motor dust extractor equipped with pre filter and a H13 main filter. Quiet and compact design. 40 litre recovery bag Jets pulsing for effective filter cleaning. 5 meter hose complete with cleaning equipment. Suitable for large quantities of concrete and plaster dust.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds awesome! And finally its technical specifications:</p>
