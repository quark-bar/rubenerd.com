<p><a href="http://j-walkblog.com/">J-Walk</a>, surprisingly the proprietor of <a href="http://j-walkblog.com/">The J-Walk Blog</a>, posted an entry about a <a href="http://j-walkblog.com/index.php?/weblog/comments/pencil_conservation/">neat gadget</a> that lets you use those tiny pencil stubs by sticking two of them together. This may have (nay, probably has) already been invented, but what about a longer gadget that you stick a short pencil stub onto the end of so you don&#39;t need two of them?</p>

<h3>On a related noteâ€¦</h3>
<p>On a related note (wait, I just said that), this post has got me thinking just how little I use writing instruments at all anymore. This is not a joke, I am serious: when I took one of my required mathematics classes last year and broke out the pens to take notes for the first class (formulae are still very difficult to generate quickly on a computer) I couldn&#39;t remember how to write lowercase letters. Literally the only time in the last few years I had ever used a pen was for filling out immigration forms which require you to print in caps. That&#39;s it!</p>

I remember back in primary school when she&#39;d write our lunch orders on those brown paper bags to give to the tuckshop and often we&#39;d get our lunch in a generic plastic bag because the tuckshop mums had kept the originals! Not only that, she could speak and write fluent Elvish &#8212; the language of the Elves from the Lord of the Rings &#8212; which when coupled with her penmanship was stunning.</p>
<p>When I can work up the courage to go through her belongings, I&#39;ll get some of work and scan it to show you all. She really was amazing.</p>
