<p>Aussie telco Telstra has launched their new <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="http://www.telstra.com.au/abouttelstra/advice/internet/">Internet and Cyber-safety</a> website for Australian internet users. Shouldn&#39;t the word &quot;safety&quot; also be capitalised? No American spell checker I don&#39;t mean <em>capitalized</em>!</p>

<h3>Hyacinth Bucket (bouquet?)</h3>
<p>Eager to break out of the stereotypes that plague Aussie government sites, the designers have bundled all us internet users into neat buckets with our own separate information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Teenagers &#038; Young Adults</li>
<li>Toddlers &#038; Children</li>
<li>Home Users</li>
<li>Professionals &#038; Providers</li>
<li>Forever Young and Retirees</li>
<li>Tips for All Ages</li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck if you&#39;re a young adult professional, or worse still a toddler retiree. That reminds me of the time I saw a kid in a pram in Singapore that was dressed in a tiny three piece suit. He was very cute, but certainly didn&#39;t look terribly comfortable. I imagine his helicopter parents  were taking him to a university or preschool interview or something. They start the pressure on kids so early thesedays, when I was a kid all my parents cared about was that I went to school and &quot;tried my best&quot;. The late 1990s were simpler times, more wholesome, family friendly times.</p>
<h3>As for the site itself…</h3>
<p><img src="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.kua2.jpg" alt="" style="width:140px; height:208px; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px;" /> I haven&#39;t had a chance to check it out other than a quick skim, but something tells me there won&#39;t be anything there about configuring FreeBSD firewalls, or bypassing proposed <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/tag/openinternet/">mandatory government internet filters</a>.</p>
<p>You know what would be really cool? If Telstra offered advice on how to bypass proposed <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/tag/openinternet/">mandatory government internet filters</a>. And the CAPTCHA would be a string of words along the lines of &quot;incompetent&quot; and &quot;intertubes&quot; superimposed onto Stephen Conroy&#39;s smirking mug. That&#39;d be hilarious.</p>
<p>In all seriousness though, kudos to Telstra for at least making a genuine attempt to connect to Aussie internet users. I would have just made a page with a few bullet points with links to further information if people wanted it, but this is better than nothing.</p>
