<p>Fire up the Terminal and type this:</p>
<pre>defaults write com.apple.iTunes full-window -1</pre>
<p>I&#39;m on tethered internet so I can&#39;t (and don&#39;t feel compelled) to download iTunes 10, so I can&#39;t check if this works or not. If it makes your Mac explode, don&#39;t come to me for a replacement. I would replace it for you, but I&#39;ve got a lot to do right now you see.</p>
