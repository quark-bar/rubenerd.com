<p>I&#39;ve been informed that it&#39;s not just Chinese New Year (Gong Xi Gong Xi Gong Xi Ni! Gong Xi Gong Xi Gong Xi Ni!) but its also Valentine&#39;s Day. So in the spirit of the day I thought I&#39;d wish all my blog readers here, Google Reader buddies and Twitter followers happy Valentines Day, because you make my life just that little bit less lonely, and I love each and every one of you! Don&#39;t ever change! Except Neal, you should move closer to inner Dublin so when a freak blizzard messes up our schedule its easier to meet up.</p>
<p>Sincerely and with lots of hugs (or manhugs, as the situation may warrant),<br />
