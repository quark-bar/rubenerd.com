<p>Did you know, if you do a Google Video Search for <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=politicians">politicians</a> on Google Video Search (well that was a redundant sentence addition), the first result you get is a video titled <em>&quot;Politicians avoiding questions&quot;</em></p>
<p>I think that says it all, sadly.</p>
