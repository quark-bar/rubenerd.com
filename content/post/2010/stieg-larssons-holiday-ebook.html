<h3>eBooks are, like, books in, like, E form</h3>
<p>Now granted this is <a title="Kobo shows record growth over Christmas holidays" href="http://www.teleread.com/paul-biba/kobo-shows-record-growth-over-christmas-holidays/">from a press release</a>. This means:</p>
<ol>
<li>most likely this was done to generate publicity (mission accomplished!)</li>
<li>like Apple with iTunes, we have no way of independently verifying this data</li>
<li>what is true for Kobo isn’t reflective of all eBooks, or dead tree books in general</li>
</ol>
<p>… but still that&#39;s a huge accomplishment for Stieg Larsson, an author who passed on before publishers would give him the break he so rightfully deserved. May he rest in peace knowing that his literary works are making people happy around the whole world.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been far too busy to read the books, but I&#39;ve been listening to audiobooks. In one word:</p>
<h3>Wowies</h3>
<p>Wowies is a word, right? I&#39;d ask Stieg Larsson given he&#39;s an author but… you know.</p>
