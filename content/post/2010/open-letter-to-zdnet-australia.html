<p>Everyone hates splash screen advertisements that take up your entire browser window, so why do site owners still employ them?</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<blockquote><p>Dear ZDNet Australia,</p>
<p>Because you have some of the best reporters in the Aussie IT industry, I put up with your universally derided splash screen advertisements. I suppose your market research demonstrates that people who immediately leave a site because they employ full screen advertisements before showing the pages people actually want are monetarily insignificant. Fair enough, it’s your site, do with it as you wish.</p>
<p>One thing I will comment on though, I’d suggest you take a look at your links to figure out why some people like me haven’t been able to get further than these splash screens over the last week; when we attempt to click the otherwise cheerful &quot;Thanks for waiting, continue on to ZDNet Australia!&quot; link, we’re redirected back to another splash screen instead. You can understand my frustration!</p>
<p>I suspect it’s due to my use of the NoScript extension for Firefox, but I can’t help but think one could create a hyperlink to an originating page without needing JavaScript in the first place. I suppose NoScript users are also statistically insignificant ;).</p>
<p>Most super-duperly graciously yours,<br />
Ruben</p></blockquote>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>Since posting this entry, a tab I had left open at one of the ZDNet Australia splash screens finally redirected me to something else. Something tells me I&#39;d better go somewhere else to find this information ;).</p>
