<p>What does Mugi do after a tiring day of playing keyboards on the set of a <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/k-on/">wildly successful anime series</a>? She <a href="http://news.livedoor.com/article/detail/4564289/">endorses pickled radish</a>!</p>
<p>If I saw this in a store I would definitely buy it, the only reason being that I tried this food once before and really liked it. Yeah, that&#39;s the only reason. Judge me however you want.</p>
