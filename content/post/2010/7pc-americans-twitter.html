<p>It&#39;s exactly what John C. Dvorak and my high school English teacher Mrs Gravina said: facts may be concrete but how you choose to phrase them in a report can have a dramatic effect on their interpretation.</p>
<p>The folks at Alltop reported that <a href="http://holykaw.alltop.com/twitter-usage-in-america-only-7-tweet?c=1">only 7% of Americans use Twitter</a>. While they were obviously unimpressed by its market share, I had always thought the percentage was much, much lower, so I wrote the heading for this post to convey the same data but with a meaning I prefer. I hope I don&#39;t get sued by Burger King.</p>
