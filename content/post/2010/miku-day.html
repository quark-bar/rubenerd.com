<p>It&#39;s <a href="http://google.com/search?q=miku%20day">Miku Day</a> and all she got from me was this lousy blog post ^_^;;. Actually it&#39;s even worse than that, Miku Day was <em>yesterday!</em></p>
<p>Hatsune Miku is of course the insanely popular idol originally from Yamaha&#39;s Vocaloid2 voice synthesiser software, but she&#39;s since been serialised in her own manga, has games released, and has even appeared in Sayonara Zetsub≈ç Sensei (of course!).</p>
