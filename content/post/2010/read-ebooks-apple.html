<p>That&#39;s a rather presumtuous presumtion Apple! I could have phrased that phrase better. I could be using <a href="http://www.lexcycle.com/">Stanza</a> instead, an application that&#39;s also free and is far more customisable. It lets me adjust the margins!</p>
<p>When I have more time I&#39;ll be doing my review of reading eBooks on the iPhone 4&#39;s screenâ€¦ so far its been amazing. But iBooks isn&#39;t so crash hot. Maybe I&#39;m just bitter that they stole the name from the iBook line of notebooks of which I&#39;m a proud owner. That little 12&quot; iBook G3 go me through high school, and was a great conversation starter for a shy nerdy dweeb ;).</p>
