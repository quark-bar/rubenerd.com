<p>In celebration of Singapore&#39;s birthday, I uploaded a couple more photos I took just before we left for the last time in July.</p>

<p>The last photo, I liked because of the contrast between old and new, and the first I liked for the colours and the contrast between the tropical looking trees and the buildings behind them. I described them in reverse order because I&#39;m being all unconventional and edgy, you see.</p>
<p>My old teachers in high school would have wanted me to use the term <em>&quot;juxtaposed!&quot;</em> to describe pictures like this, but I resisted!</p>

<p>Happy birthday Singapore, have a kopi-o and kaya toast on me.</p>
