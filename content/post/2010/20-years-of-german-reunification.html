<p>Huge hug to all my German friends and relatives :). <a href="http://rubenerd.com/margaret-thatcher-germany/">Suck on it, Margaret Thatcher!</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time I&#39;m preoccupied  and sad at the thought of Korea still divided when I see how Germany and her people are now. Why didn&#39;t the Cold War powers fight themselves instead of doing it in innocent proxy states? Or even betterâ€¦ act more like adults? Ah politics.</p>
<p>Credit to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brandenburger_Tor_abends.jpg">Thomas Wolf</a> on Wikipedia for that amazing photo of the Brandenburg Gate. I&#39;ve been to Munich, Frankfurt am Main and Stuttgart but still not Berlin.</p>
