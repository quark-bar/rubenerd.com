<p>You can use a real, physical drive as a bootable hard disk in <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">Sun</span> Oracle <a href="http://virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> using an undocumented feature, and it even works on Mac hosts!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>First make sure the drive is unmounted (aka ejected), it won&#39;t cause errors if it&#39;s mounted when you attempt this, it simply won&#39;t work.</p>
<pre>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk \
-filename [NEW DRIVE NAME].vmdk \
-rawdisk /dev/disk3</pre>
<p>Replace the <code>/dev/disk3</code> with the block identifier that represents the physical drive you want to access, in my case USB and FireWire drives. You can right click any drive in <code>Disk Utility.app</code> to find out what that is on Mac OS X or your <code>fstab</code> file.</p>
<p>This command essentially creates a pointer to the raw physical drive which you can then add to any virtual machine, just like any other virtual drive. As with creating it though, if it&#39;s mounted on the host it won&#39;t work. Also this command is <strong>undocumented and subject to change</strong>, so if the above syntax doesn&#39;t work they may have changed it since I wrote this up.</p>
<p>Because it enables raw file access, I&#39;m assuming lower level tools like SpinRite can be used in a virtual machine this way, but I have to confirm this.</p>
<p>For more information, I found <a href="http://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?p=14118&amp;sid=f7c5eb8b11edef5be711c5f92deed9a6">this VirtualBox forum topic</a> insanely useful with plenty of relevant links.</p>
