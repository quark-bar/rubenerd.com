<p>A quick tip for <a href="http://truecrypt.org/">TrueCrypt</a> users that I just figured out for myself: if you don&#39;t want your volumes to be unmounted when you quit the TrueCrypt GUI application, go to the Preferences screen and uncheck &quot;TrueCrypt quits&quot; under &quot;Dismount all volumes when&quot;.</p>
<p>Previous versions of TrueCrypt never used to unmount volumes unless you explicitly told it to. I can&#39;t remember which version changed this default behaviour, but it used to <strong>really</strong> irritate me! I suppose it&#39;s another case of erring on the side of security rather than convenience, the classic polar opposites.</p>
