<p>I&#39;ll give <a href="http://www.japanator.com/oh-yui-15729.phtml">Brad Rice of Japanator</a> a Steve Jobs answer: <strong>yup.</strong> Honestly, for its intended purpose/audience its an awesome series. It&#39;s like the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Seinfeld#Theme">Seinfeld of anime</a>. And wait for it, the best part is: <em>you don&#39;t have to watch it if you don&#39;t like it!</em>.</p>
<p>Oh and Yui, it&#39;s <strong>three</strong>, not <strong>two</strong> ;).</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It seems someone on that story already commented about Seinfeld and K-On being <strong>about nothing</strong>. And here I was thinking I was being so original. Obviously just had a Yui moment! Hah I kid Yui, you&#39;re awesome ^_____^;</p>
