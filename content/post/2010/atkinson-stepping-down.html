<p>Labor is staying in power in the misleadingly-titled <a title="South Australia tourism website" href="http://www.southaustralia.com/">South Australia</a>, but to my surprise when I woke up this morning I read Attorney General Michael Atkinson will be <a title="AdelaideNow report: Attorney-General Michael Atkinson quits front bench" href="http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/in-depth/attorney-general-michael-atkinson-to-quit-front-bench/story-fn2sdwup-1225843341005">stepping down</a> as… Attorney General. I could have phrased that better.</p>

<p>I&#39;m hoping their <a title="Post: Watching Tasmanian South Aussie election thing" href="//rubenerd.com.com/watching-that-south-aussie-election-thing/">reduced majority</a> in the state parliament (are those words supposed to be capitalised… hey that was a pun!) will force the existing Labor folk to think long and hard about future appointments to key positions like this. It probably won&#39;t, but one can wish.</p>
<p>Atkinson&#39;s departure as AG isn&#39;t just a win for <a title="Post: South Aussie election law hurts my brain" href="//rubenerd.com.com/south-aussie-elections-free-speech/">online civil liberties</a> and computer gamers who now have a potential chance for being treated as adults in the <a title="R18AU post tag" href="//rubenerd.com.com/tag/r18AU">R18AU</a> debate, but for people who have had cancer painfully strike down someone so dear to them and didn&#39;t appreciate his cold and daft <a title="Post: Comparing cancer to… computer games?" href="//rubenerd.com.com/atkinson-cancer-games">comparisons</a>.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t let the door <a title="A message for Michael Atkinson" href="http://www.amessageformichaelatkinson.com/">hit you</a> on the way out sir.</p>
