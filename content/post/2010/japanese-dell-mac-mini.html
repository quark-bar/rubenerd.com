<p>It&#39;s as if a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac Mini</a> made it with a bento box. Some pretty respectable specs, too bad for that last line, and the fact it&#39;s a Dell. Does Dell offer free Windows downgrades or refunds? Sabayon or FreeBSD would match it so well, even down to the colour schemes.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t you just love my posts with disparate sentences strung together without any cohesive train of thought? Train and Thought start with the same Romaji. Wait, is Th and T considered separate? I think I&#39;ll stop now while I&#39;m ahead.</p>
