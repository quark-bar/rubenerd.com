<p>I never knew you could do this!</p>
<ul>
<li>In Firefox, click the Bookmarks menu and Organise Bookmarks…</li>
<li>In the Bookmarks Manager, click the toolbar button with a star</li>
<li>Click Export HTML… and choose a place to save the exported file</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you have a tidy, one HTML file backup of all your Firefox bookmarks that you can even open and click links in, and reimport into another machine!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been a <a href="http://delicious.com/rubenerd/?settagview=cloud">heavy Delicious user</a> since 2003 (so was <a href="http://delicious.com/sweetische/?settagview=cloud">mum</a>), but sometimes random links find their way into my Bookmarks toolbar. Not enough to warrant use of Mich Kapor&#39;s FoxMarks, but its good to know I can back them up :)</p>
