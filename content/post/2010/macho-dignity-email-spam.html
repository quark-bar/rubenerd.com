<p>Clearly you have a differing view on the subject of dignity than I do, spammer person. Now if you&#39;d excuse me, I&#39;m off to a coffee shop while <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/unisex/japanese/74a3/">wearing this shirt</a>.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t say I had any dignity, just that they&#39;re idea of it is different to my own. Grilled cheese sandwiches and whatnot.</p>
