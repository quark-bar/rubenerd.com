<p>Don&#39;t remember when or where I saw the above picture, but what&#39;s to stop somebody… <strong>printing that picture</strong>? Wouldn&#39;t a more apt replacement for content they didn&#39;t want printed be… <strong>a blank page</strong>?</p>

<h3>Ah, but what is &quot;printing&quot;?</h3>
<p>I suppose we&#39;re getting into philosophy now: can you <strong>&quot;print&quot;</strong> a blank page? I&#39;ve unwittingly done it many times with blank paper shooting out of the printer, but has it truly been <strong>&quot;printed&quot;?</strong> I would define <strong>&quot;printing&quot;</strong> as material being adhered to paper, but if the definition is merely having paper passed through a printer then perhaps you could print a blank page. Would it still have printing if a printing press creates a page full of white space?</p>
<p>I&#39;m off to print a blank page to stare at for a while.</p>
