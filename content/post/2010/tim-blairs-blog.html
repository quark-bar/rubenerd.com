<p>Sounds like a wager, <a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/">Daily Telegraph</a>. I&#39;m in for $5. No wait, make it €5, I&#39;ve still got some coins with harps and Brandenburg Gates on them.</p>
<p>Before you get worried, I don&#39;t read the Daily Telegraph. Well, unless someone sends me an obfuscated link with a URL shorter that ends up there. I&#39;m going to make it like Merlin Mann and start pronouncing URL as Earl.</p>
