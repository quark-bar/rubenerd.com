<p>While I&#39;ve been able to unsubscribe from most email newsletters because they either offer an RSS/Atom equivalent or because they&#39;re pointless, some contain personal information which can&#39;t obviously be syndicated in the clear. I submit that of these remaining newsletters, Qantas is guilty of sending the most useless ones!</p>

<p>Aside from removing the URIs and whitespace, this is verbatim:</p>

<p>Aside from the parts I <strong>highlighted</strong> in bold, it&#39;s the same text, every single month! Despite the subject line being <em>&quot;March points balance and program news&quot;</em> they don&#39;t mention how many frequent flier points I&#39;ve received nor do they give me any news.</p>
<p>As with their service in general, Singapore Airlines newsletters are far more useful. Perhaps Qantas is just steamed that they&#39;re never been my first choice… as reflected in my frequent flyer points :P.</p>
