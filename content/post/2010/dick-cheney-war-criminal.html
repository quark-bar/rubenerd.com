<p>This isn&#39;t a technology or cute anime story, but I felt compelled to comment on it. Here&#39;s the <a href="http://www.alternet.org/news/145671/dick_cheney_admits_to_torture_conspiracy">link to the story</a>, and here&#39;s the comment: Dick Cheney is a war criminal and should be tried as such in a civilian court. He didn&#39;t want to give full civilian court rights to suspected terrorists, but I&#39;m a reasonable person.</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.alternet.org/news/145671/dick_cheney_admits_to_torture_conspiracy"><p>On Sunday, Cheney pronounced himself &#8220;a big supporter of waterboarding,&#8221; a near-drowning technique that has been regarded as torture back to the Spanish Inquisition and that has long been treated by U.S. authorities as a serious war crime, such as when Japanese commanders were prosecuted for using it on American prisoners during World War II.</p>
<p>Cheney then went further. Speaking with a sense of impunity, he casually negated a key line of defense that senior Bush officials had hidden behind for years â€“ that the brutal interrogations were approved by independent Justice Department legal experts who thus gave the administration a legitimate reason to believe the actions were within the law.</p></blockquote>
<p>If a senior official from any other nation admitted that, there&#39;d be a storm of controversy and people demanding action against them.</p>
