<p>Don&#39;t read this post. I&#39;m serious.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>Over the last few days there has been a distinct lack of communiqués owing to the fact we&#39;re moving house (again) and don&#39;t have a stable source of The Internets yet. Still, I take what I can get, so in this post I&#39;ll be doing something worthwhile by addressing several things in one. Call it value for money.</p>
<h3>The apology</h3>
<p><em>This was originally going to be in a separate post, but I stuck it here instead. It should have gone in the bin.</em></p>
<p>Forgive the distinct lack of communiqués these last few days, we still haven&#39;t moved into our new house yet and where we&#39;re staying now has unreliable internet access and virtually no Telstra or Optus phone coverage, despite being an hour-long train ride from the Sydney CBD! That was a really long sentence.</p>
<p>As an addendum to this apology, I&#39;d also like to apologise for the apology. For a post that was supposed to break the radio silence (as it were), it turned out to add nothing of value whatsoever. I might file this under <a href="//rubenerd.com/nonsense/">nonsense</a>, just because it&#39;s that pointless. Thank you.</p>
<h3>The nerds in bed thing</h3>
<p>I got a direct message on Twitter this morning from someone (who will remain anonymous) asking a very pointed question. I won&#39;t quote it here, but suffice to say it had something to do with what nerds want in bed.</p>
<p>I said sleep. Honestly, moving again these last couple of weeks has run me down like a Tangara. See, I&#39;m getting used to the Sydney lingo and am even using it in examples. I get the feeling I didn&#39;t help much.</p>
<p>In related news, I also got some DMs from someone saying some nice things about me for a change. All of it of course completely untrue, but flattery is flattery ;).</p>
<h3>This is a subtitle</h3>
<p>And this is a sentence. I think. Do strings of words need adjectives, verbs and nouns to be considered a sentence and not just a fragment? Perhaps I need to ask the Diskeeper guys and gals.</p>
<h3>The nice photo</h3>
<p>The photo shown above was the Wikipedia photo of the day on Wikipedia, shown today because it was Wikipedia&#39;s photo of the day on Wikipedia. It&#39;s a photo because it was featured on the photo of the day on Wikipedia, which was on Wikipedia, taken by <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/File:Moshi_panorama_edit1.jpg">Muhammad Mahdi Karim</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>A panoramic view of Moshi, the capital of the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania situated on the lower slopes of Mt Kilimanjaro, the tallest mountain in Africa (seen in background). Moshi is home to the Chaga and Maasai tribes and lies on the road connecting Arusha and Mombasa, Kenya.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course my old man has been to Africa on several different business trips, but I&#39;ve never been. Would <strong>love</strong> to go to Tanzania.</p>
