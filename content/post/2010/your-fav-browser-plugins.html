<p>Macslocum over at O&#39;Reilly Answers is <a href="http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/1194-what-are-your-favorite-browser-plugins-or-extensions/">asking people</a> to submit their favourite browser plugins and extensions. No prizes for guessing which one I chose!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>First Macslocum&#39;s recommendations:</p>
<blockquote><p>Firebug (Firefox) &#8212; I can’t believe this thing is free. It’s hands-down the best HTML/CSS testing tool I’ve ever used. It’s also incredibly handy when I can’t remember my own CSS naming conventions.</p>
<p>ClickToFlash (Safari) &#8212; This automatically disables any Flash-based elements. But unlike strict ad blockers, ClickToFlash gives you the option of activating Flash on a piece-by-piece basis. So if you want to watch a movie on a web page but you don’t want to see the Flash ads, just click the movie element and that Flash-based part of the page will load.</p>
<p>How about you? Which plugins/extensions do you use?
</p></blockquote>
<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I also <strong>highly</strong> recommend <a href="http://rentzsch.github.com/clicktoflash/">ClickToFlash</a> to all my Mac friends using Safari, it improves performance and reliability so much it&#39;s as if you&#39;ve just shoved an extra few gigs of memory into your system for free.</p>
<h3>My predicable answer</h3>
<blockquote><p>Without a doubt it’d have to be <a href="http://noscript.net/">NoScript for Firefox</a>. The fact no other browser has such simple blocking and whitelisting for dynamic content and Javascript ensures I won’t be switching browsers anytime soon.</p>
<p>Frankly, given all the thousands of exploits using Javascript as a vector I’m surprised (and somewhat dismayed) it’s such an unusual extension.</p>
<p><em>[For some reason text fields on the O’Reilly Network always correct JavaScript as Javascript!]</em>
</p></blockquote>
<p>As I&#39;ve enumerated here <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/noscript/">many times</a>, I can&#39;t use a browser without NoScript anymore, I feel as though I&#39;m in a car without seat bealts, a war zone without a bulletproof vest or a conference without pants when I don&#39;t have it. How people think they can be responsible internet users without such software in 2010 baffles me more than… attending a conference without pants. I suppose some people wear business skirts, just not me, surprising though that may sound. Chuck Peddle wears pants, I can tell you that much. And he invented the 6502 for heaven&#39;s sake!</p>
<p>If you have an O&#39;Reilly account, <a href="http://answers.oreilly.com/topic/1194-what-are-your-favorite-browser-plugins-or-extensions/">go over there</a> now and voice your opinion.

<p>If you haven&#39;t seen my other posts on this subject, I also talk about my other favourite Firefox plugins in these posts: <a href="//rubenerd.com/more-firefox-extensions/">More Firefox extensions</a> and <a href="//rubenerd.com/firefox-extensions/">Firefox extensions</a>. I put way too much effort into those pages! Of all the extensions, most are security related.</p>
