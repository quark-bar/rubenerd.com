<p>I get my insatiable appetite for trivia from my dear granddad. From the time I was a kid he would regale me with a particular fact, then triumphantly exclaim &quot;so there&#39;s another one to add to your vast store of useless information!&quot;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Hyundai logo, a slanted, stylized &#8216;Hâ€™, symbolizes the company shaking hands with its customer</p></blockquote>
<p>I never saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company">that</a>, but I can <em>kinda</em> see it now. Clever logos are cool.</p>
