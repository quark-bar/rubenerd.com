<p>I&#39;m starting to realise the real issue with cloud computing is not one of security or whether we trust the likes of Google to [Mostly] Do No Evil, but whether under pressure the companies running such services will feel compelled to part with our information like the information parters they are. That last bit was fairly superfluous.</p>

<h3>Closing stuff</h3>
<p>In December last year I stopped using Gmail for anything serious. There were a combination of reasons, ranging from my desire to use PGP in most of my communications, to getting frustrated at the relatively slow speeds Gmail offered when using it with a desktop email client, to wanting to use my own domain and really zippy servers with Net Solutions that I already use to host dozens of my sites and projects. Yes, I&#39;m aware all these problems could be technically overcome or tolerated if I just sucked it up. Fair enough, but I had my reasons.</p>
<p>I also deleted my Facebook account, partly because I was fed up with the antics of a few people, but also that I felt what little value I derived from it (PR speak for &quot;how much fun I had using it&quot;) was eclipsed by my distaste for what they were using my data for.</p>
<p>I have no problem with using sites like Twitter, Gowalla, 4sq and Wikipedia precisely because I&#39;m under no illusions of privacy. They&#39;re designed to allow us to broadcast our lives.</p>
<h3>I got stuck in a silo on a school excursion to a farm</h3>
<p>This latest American federal subpoena targeted at Twitter for Wikileaks&#39; supporter accounts exposes a real threat with using cloud computing applications. By having large numbers of users in one silo, sweeping and legally questionable requests can be made to access this information.</p>
<p>Twitter were good online citizens for letting us know they were being asked for information, but it leads to the inevitable question: how many other online services were compelled to divulge information about their clients&#39; data, and how many remained completely silent about doing so?</p>

<h3>I was only a kid, and that farm was big</h3>
<p>Of course this isn&#39;t negating the real possibility that a police officer couldn&#39;t kick down your door and demand to take your computer systems to access information you have stored locally instead of the cloud, or for a court to do the same, but we&#39;re <strong>kidding</strong> ourselves if we think that would scale to the same numbers as easily as it would be to just commit to some serious ninja data mining on a server farm somewhere. For one thing, there&#39;d be far fewer doors and much less kicking, which would mean more time for doughnuts.</p>
<p>Mmm, doughnuts. My favourites are the ones you buy at mum and dad bakeries in Australia. Nobody in Singapore does a good doughnut, not even those expensive Japanese bakery places.</p>
<p>I also think we&#39;re <strong>kidding</strong> ourselves if we think we can get away with not living in the cloud entirely, but for communications such as email and social networks I don&#39;t feel compelled to use any more, at least I ultimately get a say what happens to my data. At least then when I&#39;m forced to give access to my laptop to a security official at an Australian airport, I can only blame myself for all the stuff they find, such as my detailed plans for a coffee cup that leaks hot drinks on people&#39;s hands so you have a chance to escape while they treat their burns. Genius, I tell you!</p>
<h3>Can you tell me how to make one?</h3>
<p>Sure! Just drop a mug onto the floor just hard enough for cracks to form, but not have it break. Wait, why am I telling you this? You didn&#39;t read any of this. None of it.</p>
