<p>Made a few wishes out in the garden, in lieu of studying for that one minute.</p>
<p>Given it&#39;s <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/tag/binary-day/">Binary Day</a> #10<sub>2</sub> as well as being the ultimate palindrome, I took a photo and reduced it to 2 bits of colour depth. The <a href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/photo.mine.1111111111.full.png">full sized version is here</a>, if you&#39;re interested. I think it worked surprisingly well!</p>
