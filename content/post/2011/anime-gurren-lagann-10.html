<p>The first double digit episode of <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/tag/gurren-lagann/">Gurren Lagann</a> and progress seems to have stalled in solving some issues. At least they kicked arse again, quite literally this time.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p><strong>Plot:</strong> Having rescued Nia from her cryogenic chamber thingy, Simon slumps back into depression given he feels personally responsible for his brother&#39;s passing. They&#39;re confronted by Adiane, one of the Spiral King&#39;s generals, but a combination of stalling tactics and ultimately getting their Dai-Gurren ship working enough again leads them to temporary victory. Not that it matters much to Simon.</p>

<p><strong>Art:</strong> Lots of really nice clouds. I love clouds, it&#39;s why Sola was such an enjoyable (though sad) anime, and why I&#39;ve always wanted a super wide angle Tokina lens for my D60. I heart clouds, and they provided some really beautiful backdrops.</p>
<p><strong>Relationships:</strong> Strained. Despite seemingly having a crush on her in the previous episode, Simon&#39;s resurgent cold and distant emotional state renders him largely oblivious to her. Yoko&#39;s anger at what she sees as a talking down by Nia when she tries to apply logic to an emotional state only makes things more frosty.</p>

<p><strong>Tactics:</strong> A gigantic Gunmen ship&#39;s best weapon isn&#39;t its artillery arsenal (or Manchester United), but the feet it walks on and their ability to kick. Not roundhouse kick though, that&#39;s a Chuck Norris trademark. Was the Chuck Norris Facts meme around in 2008? It was, wasn&#39;t it? <strong>UPDATE:</strong> Seems as early as 2007 according to <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/mikuru-fluxbox-with-rox-filer-on-freebsd/" title="Wednesday 28th February 2007: Mikuru, Fluxbox with ROX-Filer on FreeBSD">this post</a> I wrote which features FreeBSD, Mikuru and Chuck Norris. Really.</p>
<p><strong>Technology:</strong> Despite being an advanced piece of technology, Dai-Gurren can seemingly be disabled and kick started by having a spaghetti bundle of power cords plugged in again. Reminds me of my DIY Sim Lim Square machine.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary Characters:</strong> Coco is a good cook. Coco is awesome :).</p>
<p><strong>Backfire:</strong> Despite realising she&#39;s a princess and daughter of their sworn enemy, her interrogation at the dinner table ends up being more of a language lesson for the relatively innocent Nia, and a comedic break from this otherwise heavy episode. We learn more when she confronts Adiane on the deck of Dai-Gurren.</p>
<p><img src="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/anime.gl1004.jpg" alt="" style="height:278px; width:500px;" /></p>
<p><strong>Explanations:</strong> The reason she was in a cryogenic status pod thing was what we probably all expected &#8211; she was abandoned. As such, we can only assume the Spiral King will continue to hunt them down again.</p>
<p><strong>Pride:</strong> Kamina never stood down from a fight, and seemingly the Spiral King&#39;s cronies, pawns, generals or whoever they areâ€¦ are no different.</p>
<p><img src="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/anime.gl1006.jpg" alt="" style="height:278px; width:500px;" /></p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> Simon is still understandably upset, but so much so that his fleeting interest in Nia has seemingly disappeared. The rest of the crew of Dai-Gurren seem to have warmed to her though, owing to the applause and happy faces after the retreat of their enemies.</p>
<p>Hope Simon can forgive himself soon.</p>
