<p>Its a new month, so its time for a new pointless sidebar picture! This month we have Nozomu Itoshiki from <a title="Wikipedia article on Sayonara Zetsubou-Sensei" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sayonara_Zetsubou-Sensei">Sayonara Zetsubou-Sensei</a> sporting a slightly more optimistic version of his catchphrase and primary hangup during the series. When one is dressed as fabulously as him, I doubt he has anything to worry about anyway. Shaft always has epic graphics :D.</p>
<p>The previous sidebar pictures are located, surprisingly enough, on the <a href="//rubenerd.com/sidebar-pictures/">Sidebar Pictures</a> page. I was going to call the page something completely different, like <strong>&quot;Bird is the word&quot;</strong> but I&#39;ve resigned myself to the fact most people either don&#39;t like or don&#39;t get my sense of humour, so I&#39;d spare the inevitable groans or questions for clarification ;).</p>
