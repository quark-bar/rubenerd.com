<p>You know what&#39;s creepy? When people you know discuss a topic that you&#39;re already in the process of writing a blog entry about!</p>

<h3>Followp to <em>Innocent Tiara</em></h3>
<blockquote><p>After the outbreak of the unidentified virus &#8220;Lost Christmas&#8221; in 2029, Japan has been under the control of a multi-nation organization called GHQ.</p></blockquote>
<p>See, if that &quot;multi-nation organization&quot; had been Starbucks, that would have been even cooler. Antidote Frappuccino. And they could have served it at <a title="Sunday 23rd January 2011: [Anime] Toradora Sudohbucks!" href="//rubenerd.com/anime-toradora-sudohbucks/">Sudohbucks</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Ohma Shu is a 17 year old boy who has a psychic power in his right hand. He can use the power &#8220;Ability of King&#8221; to extract tools or weapons from his friends. He has been avoiding making trouble for others but his life changes when he meets a girl Yuzuriha Inori, a member of a resistance guerrilla group called &#8220;Undertaker&#8221;, whose members pilot mecha weapons to fight against the government.</p></blockquote>
<p>Waitâ€¦ Code Geass is getting a third season? And to help them deal with the new infectious agents, they&#39;re donning Evangelion plugsuits?</p>

<h3>Kallen has a new hairstyle!</h3>
<p>Jokes aside, I&#39;m aware Code Geass is getting a third series for realsies (that is a word, isn&#39;t it?) but I&#39;m looking forward to seeing what this series is like. I typically wait until a show is in syndication before watching, but this may be one I follow during broadcast.</p>
<p>I watched Infinite Stratos, and though I didn&#39;t think it was as bad as some others seem to, here&#39;s hoping this is better! With a catchy name like Guilty Crown, they&#39;re already halfway there. Like a boss.</p>
