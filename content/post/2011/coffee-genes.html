<blockquote><p>New research suggests that individuals who carry a so-called &#8220;high-consumption&#8221; variation [in two specific genes] appear to drink more coffee.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not sure sure about genes personally; I started drinking coffee with my mum at a young age to keep awake during her early morning chemotherapy sessions. The oncology ward at Gleneagles in Singapore was always busy (a worrying sign) so we used to get the earliest appointments we could. When she moved on, I kept drinking the stuff.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, even the smell of decaffinated coffee boots my spririts and energy a little, leading me to believe there must be something else going on. A tasty placebo perhaps?</p>
