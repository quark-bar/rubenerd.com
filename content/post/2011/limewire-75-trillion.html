<p>You can read the <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/cc/PubArticleCC.jsp?id=1202486102650&#038;Manhattan_Federal_Judge_Kimba_Wood_Calls_Record_Companies_Request_for__Trillion_in_Damages_Absurd_in_Lime_Wire_Copyright_Case" style="font-weight:bold;" title="Manhattan Federal Judge Kimba Wood Calls Record Companies' Request for $75 Trillion in Damages 'Absurd' in Lime Wire Copyright Case">Law.com article here</a> for a morning laugh.</p>
<p>We can only hope such lawsuits continue to be filed. Rational copyright reform lawyers have clearly been unable to introduce common sense or logic into the fight, so perhaps letting the mafiaa [sic] unintentionally fight absurdity with absurdity may be our best hope yet of some copyright law sanity. Haha, ah, who are we kidding? ;)</p>
<p>The photo above by <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/wiki/File:Limes_whole_and_halved.jpg">NotFromUtrecht</a> on Wikimedia Commons is of two limes, which may or may not have later been drawn into filaments for use in Gnutella wires. Ruben so funny.</p>
