<p>The reasons behind the grounding of all Qantas aircraft aren&#39;t nearly as interesting or precedent than the flaw in our transport infrastructure this whole farce has exposed.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been writing essays and reports all day, so in lieu of a more detailed post I&#39;ll merely say: <a title="Wednesday 17th February 2010: We need Aussie high speed rail!" href="//rubenerd.com/aussie-high-speed-rail/">I can haz high speed rail now?!</a> Australia has several of the most crowded air lanes in the world; high speed rail wouldn&#39;t replace air travel, but it&#39;d sure relieve some of the strain. Not that it&#39;ll ever happen.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Singapore Airlines is infinitely better anyway, as I&#39;ve always said. Not that I&#39;m biased or anything. <cite>Photo by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Qantas_and_Singapore_Airlines_Airbus_A380_at_TBIA.jpg">Phillip Capper</a></cite>.</p>
