<p>It&#39;s even worse than it looks &gt;_&lt;.</p>

<p>After several years of faithful service, we bid farewell to my Compaq Armada M300 subnotebook. I <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1119/" title="Wednesday 09th April 2008: Inheriting a little Armada M300 subnotebook!">picked it up</a> second hand from my father&#39;s business back in April 2008, and was quick to <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1156/" title="Saturday 10th May 2008: FreeBSD on an Armada M300 rocks">load FreeBSD onto it</a>. While it was understandably a little slow, I dubbed it the &quot;Armadair&quot; due to its svelte size and excellent battery life.</p>
<p>It spent a month in a drawer where obviously the battery exploded, and sent acid throughout the frame and display, completely destroying the unit. I&#39;ll be harvesting as many parts as I can (wearing gloves) then sending it off to that big cloud in the sky where old computers go.</p>

<p>Throughout my life, international and domestic moves have always destroyed electronics, regardless of how well I pack things. This is the first writeoff due to battery leakage, though I suppose it was bound to happen eventually. Lesson learned: don&#39;t just remove AA batteries from remote controls, remove batteries from computers as well.</p>
<p>Where&#39;s my supercapacitor?</p>
