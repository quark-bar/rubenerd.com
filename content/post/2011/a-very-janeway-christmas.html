<p>This could very well be the greatest idea of all time: a <strong>Star Trek Voyager Christmas ornament</strong>! Not only does it look spiffy, but it can be lit up from the inside by plugging it into any standard standard string of incandescent Christmas lights!</p>
<p>I can already hear Tuvok telling me it would be illogical to get one of these.</p>
