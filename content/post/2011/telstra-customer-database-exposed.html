<blockquote><p>Detailed information about Telstraâ€™s customer accounts &#8211; including usernames and passwords &#8211; has been found to be sitting on the open web for anyone to access via a Google search. <cite>~ <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/it-pro/security-it/telstra-customer-database-exposed-20111209-1on60.html">Sydney Morning Herald</a></cite></p></blockquote>

Here&#39;s hoping they do learn from it, and implement some basic security protocols. They can start by ditching their <a href="http://mumbrella.com.au/telstra-refreshes-its-logo-and-positioning-life-in-full-colour-58095">revised coloured logos</a> and going back to their retro orange one.
