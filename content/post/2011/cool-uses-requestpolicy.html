<p>After talking about scary stuff in my <a title="Entry: CSRF, snooping, RequestPolicy for Firefox" href="//rubenerd.com/csrf-requestpolicy-firefox/">previous post</a> on the RequestPolicy extension for Firefox and other Mozilla browsers, now I get to talk about cool, fun stuff!</p>

<h3>Its an effective advertisement blocker!</h3>
<p>There are many different solutions to combating advertising on pages such as <a href="http://adblockplus.org/">AdBlock Plus</a>, <a href="http://glimmerblocker.org/">GlimmerBlocker</a> and the like, but all require the use of regularly updated blacklists to work effectively. You&#39;re probably subscribed to several lists yourself.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t even think of it when I installed it, but given the vast majority of advertising is hosted off-site (which makes it a capable attack vector, as well as being irritating) RequestPolicy also blocks this content. As the <a title="Ghostery Mozilla Firefox extension review" href="//rubenerd.com/ghostery-review/">Ghostery</a> extension does with web bugs, it also lets me see where all the advertising is coming from on a page which isn&#39;t useful in and of itself, but its still terribly interesting.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not ready to delete AdBlock Plus, but I have it deactivated for now. So far, there&#39;s very little difference. Pretty cool! ^___^</p>
<h3>Its a redirect previewer!</h3>
<p>One of the features I liked about <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">TinyURL</a> was the ability to &quot;preview&quot; URLs before you proceeded to visit them. This helps guard against people who use URL shorteners to obfuscate dodgy addresses.</p>
<p>RequestPolicy also blocks automatic redirects, instead rendering retro <code>301</code> and <code>302</code> redirect errors with a link to the new location. I can preview its address before visiting anything I may not have wanted to, and I get a sneak peak into how websites are constructed which also isn&#39;t useful in and of itself, but still terribly interesting. I&#39;ve used that same sentence somewhere before recently.</p>
<h3>It puts a red flag in the status bar!</h3>
<p>Does that make me a communist?</p>
