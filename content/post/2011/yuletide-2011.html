<p>We swapped gifts, had a turkey roast and freshly made fruit cake, played Wii games, flew a RC helicopter to scare the dogs courtesy of the illustrious <a href="http://mobile.twitter.com/omegatron">@omegatron</a>, built Lego, then took a long family walk in the park. The first real home Yule we&#39;ve had since my mum moved on, and it was absolutely wonderful :). </p>
<p>My old man and I decided to call it <em>Yule</em> given our German heritage, because the holiday was originally a winter festival before it was adapted, and because &quot;solstice&quot; isn&#39;t entirely accurate. We&#39;re precise scientific folk, you see!</p>
