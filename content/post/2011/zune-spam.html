<p>Been getting a <strong>lot lot LOT</strong> of Zune comment spam here lately. Weird thing is, they&#39;re posted on entries that have <strong>nothing</strong> to do with it whatsoever.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<blockquote><p>If you’re still on the fence: grab your favorite earphones, head down to a Best Buy and ask to plug them into a Zune then an iPod and see which one sounds better to you, and which interface makes you smile more. Then you’ll know which is right for you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well gee I&#39;d love to, but they don&#39;t sell Zunes in either of the countries I live in, nor are there Best Buys here! I &quot;smile&quot; when my pockets are relieved from not carrying two separate devices for phone calls and listening to music.</p>
<blockquote><p>The new Zune browser is surprisingly excellent, but not as great as the iPod’s. It operates nicely, but isn’t as quick as Safari, and has a clunkier interface. If you occasionally program on working with the net browser that’s not an issue, but if you’re arranging to browse the web alot from your PMP then the iPod’s bigger screen and far better browser might be crucial.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the tip, but what does that have to do with <a href="//rubenerd.com/anime-yui-socks/">Yui wearing socks</a>? Are they just spraying every post they can find with their spam? I was under the impression spammers used keyword searches to attach themselves to posts that are at least vaguely relevant.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a very exciting post, I was looking for this knowledge on the Zune. Just so you know I located your webpage when I was browsing for blogs like mine, so please check out my site sometime and leave me a comment to let me know what you think.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would, if you left a URL! They didn&#39;t leave anything. Doesn&#39;t that defeat the purpose of having a blog spam comment?</p>
<blockquote><p>Excellent submit. I learn a very important factor harder upon many different sites every day. It will always be stimulating to see content material off their copy writers and also implement a little at their Zune Marketplace. I’d intend to make usage of some using the articles on my own web site whether anyone don’t thoughts. Natually I’ll provide you with a website link with your internet website. Appreciate your expressing.</p></blockquote>
<p>That of the comment contain much the t-shirt material right there it is.</p>
<blockquote><p>Buildings are not very cheap and not everybody is able to buy it zune.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>facepalm</em></strong></p>
<blockquote><p>In Soviet Russia, Zune doesn’t buy you</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay I made that one up.</p>
<p>Are people just trying to increase the occurrence of the word on sites so when people do searches for the device they get more results? Are they just trying to spread the brown sugar around? No wait they come in other colours now, never mind.</p>
<p>By the way as a matter of disclosure, the originating IPs aren&#39;t from Microsoft. I wish I knew what they were.</p>
