<p>For over seven years I&#39;ve [largely] abstained from posting animated GIFs. Worries about being distracting aside, their file size also puts strain on my already stretched bandwidth quota.</p>
<p>I guess you could say, I found this too sweet to pass up. Yui&#39;s clothes also match my blog theme, you see.</p>
