<p>It&#39;s rather poetic in a way. These signals represent and transmit my livelihood. They facilitated a deep and obsessive interest from a young age inside me. I dedicate much of my life to using and learning about increasingly sophisticated devices that are still based on the primal signals and logic of their predecessors. These signals keep me in touch with friends here and around the world. They dutifully store my ideas, plans and dreams. I might think in decimal, breathe oxygen, eat and sleep, but these signals are just as much a part of my being. I can&#39;t imagine my life without them. </p>
<p><strong>Happy Binary Day, the first of three this month!</strong> I spent mine doing exams, and ironically I have more due for the third Binary Day, go figure! Hah, that&#39;s a pun.</p>
