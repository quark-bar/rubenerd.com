<p>Sorry I couldn&#39;t resist, <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Just_an_Illusion">it&#39;s 80s music</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway I had a point to this post, and it was regarding some photos I saw from HP today, that company that bought Palm and makes awesome calculators. Check that, <strong>used</strong> to make awesome calculators… one of my missions in life is to have a real HP-16C, not just use xcalc with the rpn option. Not to diss xcalc with the rpn option, that&#39;s still my primary calculation tool, has plety of retro awesomeness and does what I want it to.</p>

<h3>But I digress</h3>
<p>Isn&#39;t it amazing what some tapering can do to make a product look slimmer than it actually is? The laptop in the left of the photo above is from HP&#39;s press release of their new laptops, and the photo on the right is from their <a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF04a/321957-321957-64295-3740645-3955549.html">online store</a>. Granted they&#39;re not exactly the same model, but every machine in this series employs the same half-height tapering, and by taking a photo of it from above, half the bulk of the case is hidden from view!</p>
<p>Apple and other manufacturers have long since played this visual trick with their laptops and phones, now it seems HP is realising the potential of doing so! I&#39;ve seen people at uni with EliteBooks, they&#39;re absolute monsters, so anything to make them look less messive is probably a good thing… for sales ;). </p>
<p>Whatever the case (see what I did there?) my next portable machine will hopefully be the smallest thing I can get my hands on… that isn&#39;t a netbook. An <a href="http://shopap.lenovo.com/sg/en/products/laptops/thinkpad/x-series/">X series ThinkPad</a> or an <a href="http://apple.com/macbookair/">11 inch MacBook Air</a> would be schweet.</p>
