<p>Just involuntarily updated my Firefox to 8.0. So far so good, though I may need to update my update regiment. Update my updateâ€¦ it&#39;s not good English to repeat the same word in the same sentence. Wait, just did it again.</p>

<h3>The losing update battle</h3>
<p>One of the many cronjobs I have running on my headless super duper Swiss Army Knife FreeBSD server is a script to check software updates on Mozilla&#39;s servers. Whenever a new version of Firefox or Thunderbird is released, the script downloads the latest en_gb dmg. I can then go around to all the Macs in the house and install the update.</p>
<p>In Singapore I didn&#39;t bother, but with download quotas here and on an ISP that doesn&#39;t have unmetered content, it saves a small bundle of transfer which I can then blow on an anime episode. Don&#39;t worry, I didn&#39;t mean that. True story.</p>
<p>With the latest rapid-release cycle adopted by Mozilla, it seems this &quot;solution&quot; will become increasingly unworkable, and I&#39;ll just have the applications themselves download the updates.</p>

<h3>The actual update!</h3>
<p>As for the update itself, I&#39;m liking the more native-looking widgets on Mac, and it still fits in just fine on my KDE Fedora machines despite being a GTK import. Which reminds me, Fedora 16 needs to be downloaded and installed as well.</p>
<p>I&#39;d also read the horror stories about how Firefox was going to be &quot;hostile&quot; to plugins, but my laundry list of mostly security and privacy related whatsits are running just fine. The only change was the add-on selection screen, which allowed me to disable ones I don&#39;t need when Firefox relaunched. Unsurprisingly, I didn&#39;t uncheck anything.</p>

<h3>A trip down memory lane</h3>
<p>For some fun, here are a small sample of posts dealing with Firefox over the years. With this new rapid-release cycle, I think the gap between 4.0 and 7.0 you can see below will become the norm not the exception!</p>
