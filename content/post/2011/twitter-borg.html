<p>So Twitter is in the process of buying TweetDeck as well as UberMedia and Echofon, at least from what the intertubes are saying. Is their intention to assimilate every Twitter-related company out there so they have no competition and can force <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23dickbar">Dickbars</a> on all of us?</p>
<p>As long as their API remains somewhat open I suppose we have nothing to worry about for now, but their confusing messages about developers and now this leaves me a little nervous. And my name isn&#39;t even Dick.</p>
