<p>While I&#39;m not qualified to comment on the specifics of old growth forests in Tasmania, one thing I can say from watching <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/tv/qanda/">Q&amp;A</a> this evening was that Eric Abetz&#39;s take on science was a tad offensive.</p>
<p>Whether it be in the news media or general discourse, people are entitled to their own opinions, but nobody is entitled to their own facts. Asserting science and shock jocks like Alan Jones are of level footing on a supposed spectrum of ideology is simply not true.</p>
