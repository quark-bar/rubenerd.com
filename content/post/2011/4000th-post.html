<p>Granted I&#39;m more looking forward to post 4096 (2^12) in my cavalcade of <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">pointless site milestones</a>, but 4000 posts is still pretty big! To celebrate, I&#39;ve <strong>dug out a series of screenshots</strong> showing the history of the site, for those who are mildly interested. Thank you for readership and patronage! ^_^</p>

<h3>2003-2004</h3>
<p>I registered Rubenerd.com in 2003 when I was in high school in Singapore. I didn&#39;t know what I wanted to use it for, just that it was to be named after the email address I&#39;d been using since I was 12. Ruben + Nerd =  Rubenerd, it seemed super smart… at the time.</p>
<p>I created a series of tabs using Paint Shop Pro, then lined them up. This was before YouTube and Flickr had only just started, so I hosted <strong>all</strong> my material under several tabs!</p>

<h3>2004</h3>
<p>After realising a site with heaps of sections was simply too much work to maintain, I completely ditched the old site and rebooted Rubenerd.com as a blog. I had just started learning Perl so I created a simple CGI script to generate the pages. Ironically, I think this earliest version of Rubenerd.com was the best looking, go figure!</p>

<h3>2005</h3>
<p>After a few months I moved to <a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/overview/">RapidWeaver</a>, a Mac OS X client-side blogging platform. I still think it had by far the best user interface for writing posts I&#39;ve ever used, though their themes at the time left a little to be desired!</p>

<h3>2005-2006</h3>
<p>When I started studying in Adelaide, I moved from RapidWeaver to WordPress. While RapidWeaver worked great on my PowerMac G5, I couldn&#39;t exactly take it back with me when I went back to Singapore during the holiday breaks!</p>
<p>I liked the <a href="http://www.kingcosmonaut.de/blix/">Blix theme</a>, but made the colours bolder and far less attractive. Someone should really have stopped me.</p>

<h3>2006-2009</h3>
<p>Up to this point my blog had been a sporadically-updated sideshow to my podcast, but in 2006 I started blogging on a more regular basis, as can be seen in my site archive. With this in mind, I decided to take the vanilla <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/sandbox">Sandbox theme</a> and create new themes for my podcast site, and one for the blog to match. I was generally in a pretty dark mood (though not emo!) given family troubles and my mum&#39;s rapidly deteriorating health, and I suppose this was reflected somewhat here.</p>
<p>I also resurrected the logo I&#39;d designed for my &quot;business&quot; in primary school helping expats fix their printers to tap some of that youthful optimism. This logo has been on all my stuff again ever since :).</p>

<h3>2007</h3>
<p>Having been tired with a dark background for a while, I decided to start from scratch with a new lighter theme I coded myself, and on a new domain. The new site and the htaccess redirects from Rubenerd.com were live for less than 24 hours before I ditched it and went back to the previous one!</p>

<h3>2009-2010</h3>
<p>Changed themes again, also created entirely from scratch. I saw my original Rubenerd.com site design and felt a tingle of nostalgia, so I tried to recreate parts of it and match the colours of the original tabs, with mixed results!</p>

<h3>2011</h3>
<p>Obviously not a lot of progress ;).</p>
