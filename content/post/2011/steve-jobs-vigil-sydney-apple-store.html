<p>Originally I wasn&#39;t going to go, but around 11pm something snapped inside me and I took the last train into town.</p>

<p>It was misty outside with a gentle amount of rainfall, though not enough to extinguish the candles or run the ink on the notes people left.</p>

<p>Since the photo <a href="http://delimiter.com.au/2011/10/06/memorial-gathers-at-apple-store-sydney/">Renai posted on Delimiter</a> this afternoon, people have since left apples, notes, candles and even a forth generation iPod.</p>

<p>In he insight, I&#39;m glad I went late in the evening than during the day. There were still a few people crowded around, but I was able to stand there like a fanboi loser for a few minutes and pay respects without people bumping into me. The light of the candles was also rather warm and pretty in the darkness.</p>

<p>A comment my sister just made: how many other CEOs can you name would have such a fan created vigil made in their honour?</p>
