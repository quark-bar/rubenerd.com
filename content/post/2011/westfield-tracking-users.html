<blockquote cite="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/11/09/11/0038242/Global-Mall-Operator-Starts-Reading-License-Plates"><p>Westfield Group, one of the largest shopping centre operators in the world, has launched a find-my-car iPhone app. The system uses a series of license plate reading cameras dotted throughout their multi-level car parks. Westfield said police could also use it to find stolen or unregistered vehicles. (Hello, slippery slope.)<br />

<p>I take public transport, so people track me with my purchased tickets. In Singapore with proximity stored value cards, this is even easier. As a kid I went all the way out to <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Jurong_East_MRT_Station">Jurong East</a> and <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Pasir_Ris_MRT_Station">Pasir Ris</a> just to muddy and confuse their &quot;downtown expat&quot; profile of me. I was a wild, out of control teen ;).</p>
<p>As to this Westfield story, it rubs me the wrong way but I suppose it was only inevitable.</p>
