<p>Read it on <a href="http://j-walkblog.com/index.php?/weblog/posts/Youths_Drink_More_Coffee/">The J-Walk Blog</a> from Reuters, so it must be true!</p>

<h3>Coffeeâ€¦ Coffee Coffee!</h3>
<p>From the report itself, which J-Walk also quoted, which means this post may qualify for some serious Inception:</p>
<blockquote><p>Young American adults have increased the amount of coffee they drink daily in 2011, after feeling better about their finances following the global economic crisis, a survey showed on Saturday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Funny, I would have thought drinking coffee to cram for more exams to get into the fewer available jobs would be endemic of further financial difficulties and job problems. Go figure!</p>
<p>For what its worth, I started drinking coffee when I was 14, so I could stay awake during my mum&#39;s super early chemo sessions. I used to drink six cups a day, but I&#39;m down to two now and no longer get serious caffeine headaches if I miss out. Ironically, I feel I have more energy as a result.</p>
<h3>That reminds me!</h3>
<p>Having only just wrote an entry about coffee, I noticed in my PayPal inbox that <a href="https://twitter.com/roel247">Roel247</a> donated a cup of coffee to me a few days ago! I wanted to thank him personally here for being so friendly :).</p>
<p>For those who don&#39;t know, Roel was one of my most loyal supporters of the Rubenerd Show back in the day and is one of the most genuinely nice people I&#39;ve ever had the plesure of conversing with. One of these days I&#39;ll go to The Netherlands and meet him, this much is sure :).</p>
