<p>Patently Apple <a href="http://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2011/08/apple-sued-over-fast-booting-in-os-x-with-a-patent-linked-to-lg-electronics.html">is reporting</a> Apple is being sued for patent infringement with their new line of Macs. Specifically:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A method for fast booting a computer system, comprising the steps of: A. performing a power on self test (POST) of basic input output system (BIOS) when the system is powered on or reset is requested; [..] C. storing the boot configuration information from execution of the POST operation before loading a graphic interface (GUI) program, based on the checking result; [..]&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple computers don&#39;t have a BIOS, and configuration data is stored after the GUI launches.</p>
<p>Apple has infringed many patents, but this should be dismissed on the grounds of dumbness. Is that an admissible legal defence?</p>
