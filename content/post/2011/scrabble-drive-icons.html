<p>Thought I&#39;d have a theme to my posts today :). </p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>One of the pointless, nostalgic things I miss about Windows and DOS are drive letters, so this afternoon on a whim I decided to label mine with none other than <a href="http://iconeasy.com/iconset/bag-o-tiles-icons/">Scrabble icons by Marc Heatley</a>, and then for something completely different some purple and blue letter icons from <a href="http://iconeasy.com/iconset/multipurpose-alphabet-icons/">Supratim Nayak&#39;s fine collection</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, such an endeavour reminded me why drive letters were a dumb idea; in the days of DOS they made more sense given users didn&#39;t generally partition their drives, use virtual volumes and had limited physical drives themselves, but thesedays they&#39;re redundant and very limiting! I gave up with the network icons and just stuck with X, because they look XTREME.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep them for a day, if only because they took half an hour to configure that I can&#39;t get back. Tomorrow it&#39;ll be <a href="http://iconseeker.com/search/La%20Patisserie%20icon%20set%20MacPC/">back to pastries</a>. Don&#39;t laugh, these are all very important decisions for the maintainer of any modern computer system; well other than the ones that eschew (gesundheit) desktop icons.</p>
