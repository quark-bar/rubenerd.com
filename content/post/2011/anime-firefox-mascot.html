<p>Another long day of doing stuff and not much time for blogging, so instead of regaling you with a tale of yet another <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/extensions/">new Firefox extension</a>, I thought I&#39;d do something entirely pointless and compare two of the Firefox mascots.</p>
<p>Who do you think does a better job, Firefox-tan herself, or Konata as Konatan? Firefox-tan has the advantage that she already is the <em>de facto</em> Firefox mascot in the hopelessly otaku world, but Konata from Lucky Star cosplaying as the Firefox icon is simply too funny!</p>
<p>In other news, I tried Firefox 4.0 Beta 10 this afternoon. Broke a whole bunch of my plugins, but certainly looks slick. Question is, can it woo back some of the nerds who moved to Chrome?</p>
