<p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9216608/Open_source_foiled_Microsoft_antitrust_case">ComputerWorld</a> is reporting the US Department of Justice&#39;s supervision of Microsoft ends today; this ends the case that started in 1998. <a href="http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/05/11/2243246/Microsoft-Antitrust-Oversight-Ends">Slashdot</a> has a thread.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenerd/statuses/7894727848">many of us</a> have said: remember when Microsoft used to be scary? They&#39;re still abusing their market clout (OOXML), but a combination of irrelevance and incompetence has blunted the knife. After commanding the direction of the industry in the 1990s, they&#39;ve either missed the boat or played catch up to most of the important tech trends of the 2000s. </p>
<p>Granted I was a primary school kid at the time, but I said breaking up the company wouldn&#39;t make much difference. This was when I was a Visual C++ developer though ;).</p>
