<p>Happy Canada Day to all my Canadian friends, from another of Her Majesty&#39;s realms ;). I haven&#39;t yet had the pleasure of visiting your country, but friends and family members who have claim it&#39;s the most beautiful place on Earth. Well, my old man claims it&#39;s a tie between Canada and Ireland, but the point stands!</p>
<p>As I heard a guy in a coffee shop today say <em>&quot;those Canadians are just about the friendliest people in the world!&quot;</em> There&#39;s a political statement there too :).</p>
