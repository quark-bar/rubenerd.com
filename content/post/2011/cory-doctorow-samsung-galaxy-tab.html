<blockquote><p>The Galaxy has all the right parts, but theyâ€™re assembled without much care or forethought. <cite>~ <a href="http://boingboing.net/2011/07/25/samsung-galaxy-tab-10-1-android-ipad-killer-is-a-poorly-thought-through-disappointment.html">BoingBoing</a></cite> </p></blockquote>
<p>Most of Apple&#39;s hardware competitors in a nutshell. They cram in as many features as they can to tick off specification lists for reviewers, but then ultimately fail in their execution, relegating them to the ever growing pile of <em>would-be</em> iDevice killers.</p>
<p>I guess companies (and advocates of other platforms) still think they can outsell cake to non-geeks with a list of ingredients. Which is a shame, because Apple has shortfalls too.</p>
