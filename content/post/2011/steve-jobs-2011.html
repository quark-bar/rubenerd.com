<p>Like so many other people I could spend my time here conflating Steve&#39;s condition with the potential shallow short term business implications for Apple (though their recent blockbuster performance would indicate everything is better than fine!), but just sent this instead.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dear Steve,</p>
<p>Even with a similar recent family experience with health, I won’t pretend to relate with what you and your family are going through right now, particularly with a tasteless media circus chasing you.</p>
<p>Please don’t let them get to you. Stay strong, and get better in your own time, for yourself and your family. *manhug*</p>
<p>Peace, health and happiness,<br />

<p>What he&#39;s going though is damned scary. I&#39;m sure that won&#39;t stop a few tasteless jackarses <a href="http://rubenerd.com/steve-jobs-health/">making comments like this</a> though.</p>
