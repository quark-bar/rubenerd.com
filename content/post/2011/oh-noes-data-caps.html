<p>Indeed. This is why automated web backup and online video streaming services are im(practical, possible) for most Australians where data caps are the norm, and where in some cases they&#39;re actively encoraged for dubious reasons. Of course the NBN and sorely needed government investment will fix everything!!1!!!one! Right?</p>
