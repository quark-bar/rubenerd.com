<p>To my beautiful, friendly, cheeky, brilliantly talented, witty, trolling, free spirited best friend and mum who suddenly lost the battle four years ago today. I still feel your glamourously fabulous cane with Christmas lights wound around it hitting me on the head when I say something particularly nerdy or stupid, or when I sing Dean Martin off key, or when I start to doubt myself.</p>
<p>I miss you so much it hurts, but you&#39;re still my rock and in all my thoughts. I love you &lt;3</p>
