<blockquote><p>France’s new data retention law requires online service providers to retain databases of their users’ addresses, real names and passwords, and to supply these to police on demand. Leaving aside the risk of retaining all this personal information (identity thieves, stalkers, etc &#8212; that which isn’t stored can’t be stolen and leaked), there’s the risk of requiring providers to store plaintext passwords, as Bruce Schneier points out. ~ <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2011/04/11/france-to-require-cl.html?dlvrit=36761">BoingBoing</a></p></blockquote>
