<p>Yay, a K-On <a href="//rubenerd.com/anime-k-on-movie/">movie poster</a>! Judging from the open blazer and blond hair, I’d say Ritsu is #2 and Mugi is #4. Azusa and Mio wear the same black socks so I can’t tell them apart! Why are you looking at me like that?</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Just noticed the black ponytail, so Azusa is #3, which therefore makes Mio #1. I think!</p>
