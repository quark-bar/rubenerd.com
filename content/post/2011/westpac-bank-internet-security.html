From his new blog where <a href="http://rainerschade.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/banking-westpac-etal/">he reviews Westpac</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://rainerschade.wordpress.com/2011/03/17/banking-westpac-etal/"><p>Security is another concern &#8212; Westpac don’t use an external number generating dongle and only allow a simple low level 6 digit pin for on-line banking and 4 digit ATM pin &#8212; don’t know if that’s common but certainly doesn’t seem good especially for banking.</p></blockquote>
<p>No kidding. In 2011 banks don&#39;t have an excuse for not providing a third factor authentication system, and enforcing low entropy passwords. He&#39;ll be contacting them later this week, I&#39;ll be interested to hear what they say.</p>
