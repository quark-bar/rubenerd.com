<p>This story could potentially be bigger than The Gap&#39;s ill fated new logo that looked like a blue version of PricewaterhouseCoopers or however you spell it. Waterhouse sounds like a company that fixes dodgy roofs.</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>First of all, to get it out of the way because I&#39;ve heard it all before every time I mention Starbucks on Twitter, Gowalla and Foursquare.</p>
<p>Starbucks is a heartless megacorportaion, their coffee is terrible, and Ruben Schade is not only a stupid sucker and a pawn, he&#39;s also not politically correct saying he likes spending time there having caramel macchiatos. He&#39;s a poser and a fool, and spending just as much time at a local family run coffee shop in his neighbourhood does nothing to clear his super evil conscience. He should go to the Starbucks CEO and offer him sexual favours in exchange for his servitude, and just move to Seattle to pretend he&#39;s Frasier like all those other stupid people who think Starbucks is a relaxing, nice place to have a cup of coffee and get a little work done. They&#39;re all just so arrogant imposing themselves on others with their holier than thou attitude and their cups with paper sleeves. Why don&#39;t they just accept that different people like different things already?</p>
<p>Yeah yeah, whatever. Moving on.</p>
<h3>This Is The New Sh*t</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t <a title="Wikipedia article: This Is the New Shit by Marilyn Manson" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/This_Is_the_New_Shit">listen</a> to Marilyn Manson at all and think his music is terrible, but I have respect for him. Like Lady Gaga, or that guy who&#39;s always playing that weird guitar at Central.</p>
<p>I had no idea but the current Starbucks logo has been in use since 1992 when they had their IPO. I know this because I read their press release, and if information is in a press release, it must be true.</p>
<p>The updated logo isn&#39;t really new <em>per s&eacute;</em>, they&#39;ve merely removed the phrase <strong>&quot;Starbucks Coffee&quot;</strong> from the name, expanded the mermaid woodcut and changed the colour to match the aforementioned name that was once there. From their weblog post <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/blog/Bringing-the-Siren-to-Life">Bringing the Siren to Life</a>, second paragraph:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.starbucks.com/blog/Bringing-the-Siren-to-Life"><p>From the start, we wanted to recognize and honor the important equities of the iconic Starbucks logo. So we broke down the four main parts of the mark – color, shape, typeface and the Siren. After hundreds of explorations, we found the answer in simplicity. Removing the words from the mark, bringing in the green, and taking the Siren out of her ring. For forty years she’s represented coffee, and now she is the star.</p></blockquote>
<p>So that&#39;s my problem, I&#39;m trapped in a green ring that says  <strong>&quot;Ruben Schade&quot;</strong>! Maybe if I took myself out of that ring and painted myself green I&#39;d be more dynamic and synergistic. Yes, apparently synergistic is a word. <em>facepalm</em></p>
<h3>Thoughts</h3>
<p>I&#39;m of two minds about this. First, to paraphrase Einstein, I&#39;m generally not a fan of change simply for the sake of change unless there&#39;s something meaningful derived from it. This updated logo doesn&#39;t really seem to do this, at least to me as a non-graphics designer. The typeface and stars and colour balance in the current logo are just brilliant.</p>
<p>Perhaps wrapping the logo in &quot;Starbucks Coffee&quot; was part of an elaborate, two decade long scheme to get us to associate their logo with those words, much like Nike had their name next to the swoosh for a while before removing it, or Apple Computer having their retro typeface &quot;a&quot; as part of the bitten part of the logo and pple proceeding it, then having no lettering at all.</p>
<h3>Its the Illuminati, or something</h3>
<p>Of course conspiracy theorists no doubt will claim the removal of the term Coffee from the Starbucks logo is akin to Kentucky Fried Chicken changing their name to KFC because their stock was so heavily genetically modified that they couldn&#39;t legally be called chickens any more. Oh you didn&#39;t hear about that? Yeah, its all true! Its not because its so fatty I always feel green afterwards, its for THAT reason I don&#39;t eat it!</p>
<p>You see, Starbucks doesn&#39;t sell coffee, they sell coffee flavoured floor sweepings, and all those pesky truth in advertising laws would have meant a drastic logo change anyway, so they may as well disguise their products true origins as well as save themselves the hassle of adding all those extra words to the logo which is already big enough. I mean, only a Venti cup could fit a real description in the logo rather than just Starbucks Coffee.</p>
<h3>Con Clus Ions</h3>
<p>I dunno, on the one hand I&#39;m pleased they&#39;re retaining the main part of the logo, but call me a cranky old man who drinks terrible coffee or any other insult you care to throw at me, but I like the current one better. And to prove it, I&#39;m having a drink from their branch in Wynyard now as I speak. Or type, or whatever this is. Near the <a title="Wikipedia entry: Wynyard Railway Station, Sydney" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wynyard_railway_station,_Sydney">station of the same name</a>.</p>
<p>Hey, at least they&#39;re not <a title="Entry: Starbucks shuts down in South Australia" href="//rubenerd.com/p1213/">pulling an Adelaide</a> in Sydney :O.</p>
