<blockquote><p>NAB’s payments processing meltdowns were a &#8220;wake-up call&#8221; for the financial services community, […] said CGU Insurance Australia chief information officer (CIO) Ian Frew. ~ <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/nabs-it-woes-a-wake-up-call-cgu-339316424.htm">ZDNet Australia</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Of all industries, financial services should be at the forefront of security and privacy of information, and if they&#39;re not they should be brutally beaten into submission until they are. I&#39;m sorry, but this situation is abhorrent.</p>
<p>In a broader sense, why do businesses refuse to learn from others and only [promise to] implement security measures only after they&#39;ve been bitten themselves? I&#39;d hazard a guess that middle managers don&#39;t take it seriously until it&#39;s a PR issue. Heh, Sony.</p>
