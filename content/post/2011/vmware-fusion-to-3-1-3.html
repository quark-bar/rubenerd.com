<p>If you haven&#39;t seen yet, VMware just updated <a href="http://downloads.vmware.com/d/info/desktop_downloads/vmware_fusion_for_the_mac/3_0">Fusion</a> to 3.1.3. I can&#39;t see amongst the list improvements any mention of fixes for VMware Tools for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 Workstation that I <a title="Fun with VMware Fusion 3.1.2 instability" href="http://rubenerd.com/vmware-fusion-312-instability/">half-jokingly blogged about</a>, but installing just in case.</p>
<p>My previous attempts to install the VMware Tools in NT 4.0 resulted in BSoDs immediently after rebooting, but for some reason on my forth attempt it generated the same error in a modal dialogue box immediently before restarting.</p>
<p>Still no word on my <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/message/1763913#1763913">forum post</a> on the topic either. Guess the adage appliesâ€¦ you get what you pay for. Hey wait, I <strong>did</strong> pay for this!</p>
