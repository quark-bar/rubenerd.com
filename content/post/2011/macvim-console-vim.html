<p>Shortly after posting my entry about building Vim from source because Homebrew preferred I install MacVim or use OS X&#39;s outdated version instead, Ibid <a href="//rubenerd.com/mercurial-vim-mac-os-x/">commented</a> that MacVim hides regular Vim inside its application bundle. A quick check confirms that it does! This is why I blog, to learn stuff from awesome people :).</p>

<h3>My dad asked me once why I was typing &#8220;is&#8221;</h3>
<p>For those who have installed it from the binary disk image:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family:monospace;"><p>
% ls /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS<br />
MacVim* vim*
</p></blockquote>
<p>And from Homebrew, presuming you haven&#39;t symlinked it yet (reconstruct onto one line, <code>ls</code> doesn&#39;t like multi-line backslash!):</p>
<blockquote style="font-family:monospace;"><p>
% ls $HOMEBREW_PATH/macvim/[version]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/MacVim.app/Contents/MacOS<br />
MacVim* vim*
</p></blockquote>
<p>MacVim is the the Cocoa version of Vim we&#39;ve come to love, and Vim is indeed regular Vim!</p>
<h3>Chrome has longer version numbers</h3>
<p>At the time of writing, obviously this version of Vim lags a little behind what you&#39;d get from building the source yourself (<code>7.3.107</code> versus <code>7.3.108</code>), but that&#39;s certainly far newer than the <code>7.2.x</code> tree we&#39;re still on with Snow Leopard by default.</p>
<p>Unlike gvim builds of Vim which can just be called without the <code>-gtk</code> flag to render a regular emulator in the shell, MacVim is thoroughly a Cocoa application, so I presumed launching vanilla Vim wasn&#39;t possible. Building from source will give me the latest version, but I&#39;m tempted just to use MacVim&#39;s version from now on, if only so then I have one less Vim floating around my system which I otherwise keep meticulously tidy!</p>
