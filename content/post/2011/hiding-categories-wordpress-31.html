This time it <a title="Entry: Excluding WordPress categories" href="//rubenerd.com/excluding-wp-categories/">stopped my method</a> for excluding Twitter backup posts from my RSS feed. I&#39;m frightfully sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to spam you like that!</p>
<p>I frantically installed Advanced Category Excluder but its also horribly broken. Fortunately, the latest beta of <a href="http://ryowebsite.com/wp-plugins/category-visibility/">RYO Category Visibility</a> works a treat, and is far simpler than ACE.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience ^__^.</p>
