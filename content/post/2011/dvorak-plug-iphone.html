<p>Plenty of people on Twitter today were sharing a link to <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-should-pull-the-plug-on-the-iphone">this story from John C. Dvorak</a> in 2007 that was just too good to pass up ;).</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem here is that while Apple can play the fashion game as well as any company, there is <strong>no evidence</strong> that it can play it fast enough. These phones go in and out of style so fast that unless Apple has half a dozen variants in the pipeline, its phone, even if immediately successful, will be pass√© within 3 months.</p>
<p>There is <strong>no likelihood</strong> that Apple can be successful in a business this competitive. Even in the business where it is a clear pioneer, the personal computer, it had to compete with Microsoft and can only sustain a 5% market share.</p></blockquote>
<p>Imagine if John had been right and Apple ceased development after the first failed iPhone. Spare a thought for Android developers, who would be left for them to copy off? Microsoft? Would we all be using Kin-like devices?</p>
