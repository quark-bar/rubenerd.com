<p>The Post A Day 365 team recently posed the question: <a href="https://dailypost.wordpress.com/2011/08/09/explain-the-name-of-your-blo/">Explain the name of your blog and why you chose it</a>.</p>
<p>Mine was born of a simple mind from the bad old days of Web 1.0. Having decided to register for an online email account, my 12 year old brain was mortified that <em>&quot;Ruben&quot;</em> was taken. It dawned on me though that my name and the adjective <em>&quot;Nerd&quot;</em> shared a letter that could be portmanteau-ed into something terribly awkward, but unique!</p>
<p>13 years later, and I&#39;m still using a variant of that logo I designed as a kid, and the Rub&eacute;nerd handle for virtually everything. I could probably design and think of far better things now, but there&#39;s a certain childish innocence and optimism in them that&#39;s nice to have sticking around :).</p>
