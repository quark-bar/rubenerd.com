<p>There hasn&#39;t been any annoumcenet of it yet on <a href="http://blog.gowalla.com/">Gowalla&#39;s blog</a>, but it&#39;s being reported across the tubes the checkin service has been bought by Facebook. Seems I <a title="Friday 23rd September 2011: Goodbye @Gowalla" href="//rubenerd.com/goodbye-gowalla/">jumped ship</a> just in time.</p>
<p>I wish the team the best of luck in Palo Alto, and hope they do the right thing and allow us to easily export our checkins. Our <a href="http://gowalla.com/users/rubenerd/checkins.atom">Atom feeds</a> have been dead for months and their promise to &quot;<a href="http://help.gowalla.com/customer/portal/questions/42328-export-items-pins">definitely</a>&quot; develop export tools have gone unfulilled. During early 2010 I used Gowalla to track our last <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/eurotrip/">journey through Europe</a>, and would desperately like to not have that stuff lost.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Was about to take a crack at their <a href="https://gowalla.com/api/explorer/">API</a>, but then rediscovered the gloriously named <a href="http://export.synack.me">export.synack.me</a>. Got my checkin history emailed to me in a JSON file. Brilliant! <a href="http://gowalla.com/checkins/1898931">The Hairy Lemon</a>!</p>
