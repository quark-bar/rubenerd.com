<p>Given John Walkenbach is an <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/2036556743/">Excel guru</a>, on a whim this afternoon I wondered what better way to pay tribute to his <a href="//rubenerd.com/goodbyej-walk-blog/" title="Monday 17th October 2011: Goodbye to the J-Walk Blog after 9 years">ended J-Walk Blog</a> than by creating some graphs!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>We begin, above, with the number of posts we&#39;ve both written containing the name of the world&#39;s most awesomely titled location, your favourite place and mine, Saskatchewan. For this graph, I determined the number of posts containing said locale, then divided it by the total number of posts we&#39;ve written. Judging from this, we can deduce John was at least three times more interested in ice hockey than I was, and three times more likely to have a live moose roaming in his pantry.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a chart comparing the number of years the J-Walk Blog was active compared to Rub&eacute;nerd.com. For interest&#39;s sake, I also included the late Whole Wheat Radio which was an influence on both of us, and that we both blogged frequently about during its heyday. John even met the site&#39;s proprietor, something I hope to do at some point as well.</p>
<p>According to this, I have two years to match WWR, and three for J-Walk. Wonder if I&#39;ll be able to overcome this apparent 8 to 9 year itch.</p>

<p>You think I blog too much? I&#39;m a rank amateur compared to the blogging machine that was J-Walk, and who continues to be on Google+. Granted many of my posts tend to be longer than his, but given he&#39;d only been blogging a few years longer than me, that&#39;s pretty friggen amazing.</p>
<p>Check out the specific number of posts too. Aside from the 3 in the middle, the numbers are the same. That&#39;s just freaky.</p>

<p>And now we end on something that Google proposes but I still simply can&#39;t believe! Despite his order of magnitute more entries than yours truly, and despite both sharing a passion for this most perfect of constables, both in relative and absolute terms I&#39;ve mentioned them more often than he has.</p>
