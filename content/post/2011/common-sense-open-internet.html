<blockquote cite="http://delimiter.com.au/2011/05/26/conroy-trusts-publics-common-sense-on-filter/"><p>&quot;Here is an opportunity to to make your arguments. I trust to the <strong>common sense</strong> of the Australian public with respect to the classification system.&quot;<br />
~ Stephen Conroy, as <a href="http://delimiter.com.au/2011/05/26/conroy-trusts-publics-common-sense-on-filter/">reported</a> by Renai LeMay for Delimiter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr Conroy has it backwards. He can ask for our opinion, but the fact is he has repeatedly failed to prove the financial and technical feasibility of his filter, to say nothing of the threat it poses to civil liberties. In the words of Christopher Hitchens: <span style="font-style:italic">&quot;What can be asserted without proof can be dismissed without proof.&quot;</span></p>
<p>Therefore I submit the only common sense thing to do, is scrap it!</p>
