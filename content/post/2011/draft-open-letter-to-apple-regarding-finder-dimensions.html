<blockquote><p>Dear Apple Engineers,</p>
<div style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">Regarding dimensions, or a lack thereof</div>
<p>With every Mac OS X release since 10.4 Tiger (and quite possibly even earlier) your Finder application has refused to display the dimensions of certain images.</p>
<p>It is my opinion the Finder in column view sets the standard for graphical file managers that other software outfits have emulated, but never surpassed. However, this one nagging bug that has yet to be fixed in at least six years could potentially cause premature balding, and despite how attractive some men look with that style I doubt it would suit me.</p>
<p>Peace, health and happiness,<br />
