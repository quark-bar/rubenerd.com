<blockquote><p>Critics of Social Security and Medicare frequently invoke the words and ideals of author and philosopher Ayn Rand, one of the fiercest critics of federal insurance programs. But a little-known fact is that Ayn Rand herself collected Social Security. She may also have received Medicare benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Ayn Rand Center for Individual Rights also has a page on their website entitled <a href="http://www.aynrand.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&#038;id=10857&#038;news_iv_ctrl=1021">Social Security is Immoral</a>. Me thinks we&#39;ll be seeing a revision soon to include an exception clause. Sounds like if Santa was a programmer. Bad joke, sorry.</p>
