<p>Never before have I installed an extension so quickly! For <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/MurdochAlert-details/">Firefox</a> and for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moepiacmhnmbiilhpojodnaopndhddpg">Chrome</a>.</p>

<p>For those who haven&#39;t been watching this narrative unfold since the mid 20th Century, Rupert Murdoch is an Australian/American media mogul who&#39;s far reaching worldwide holdings include the very best in unbiased, factual, journalistic endeavours. Still, if you want to spare yourself the delight of reading such wonderful material, here&#39;s how you do it.</p>
<h3>For Firefox</h3>
<p>From the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/MurdochAlert-details/">Mozilla Add-Ons page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>MurdochAlert show a warning bar on Murdoch Family-controlled websites. This alerts users to the potential computer security risks of accessing Murdoch-controlled sites. Handy also for identifying the news sources controlled by the Murdoch Family.</p></blockquote>
<p>I installed the extension, and sure enough I was presented with a warning when going to The Australian and to Fox News. Which is a relief, because I wouldn&#39;t want people to know I&#39;ve been to such sites. Or Andrew Boltâ€¦ but that&#39;s another topic entirely.</p>

<p>Firefox-tan is happy ^_^.</p>
<h3>For Chrome</h3>
<p>I don&#39;t use Chrome or Chromium other than for testing, but it didn&#39;t take long for an extension in a similar spirit to MurdochAlert to be issued for it, in the form of <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moepiacmhnmbiilhpojodnaopndhddpg">Murdoch Block</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What does this app do?</strong></p>
<p>- Blocks websites owned and operated by Newscorp</p>
<p><strong>Which websites are blocked?</strong></p>
<p>- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_News_Corporation</p>
<p><strong>How is a site blocked?</strong></p>
<p>- The default list is only news and publication sites but that can be customized on the options page.</p>
<p>- When the user opens a blocked site, a warning is displayed and the user is given an option to continue to the site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Granted MurdochAlert has a more urgent sounding name that successfully conjurers up images of warning sirens, but I give kudos to these people for coming up with a term that rhymes.</p>
