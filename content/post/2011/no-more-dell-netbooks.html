<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-57343972-64/dell-says-goodbye-to-netbooks/">CNET is reporting</a> Dell will no longer be selling netbooks, due to falling demand and likely low profit margins:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dell is [no] longer interested in selling Netbooks&#8211;that category of 10-inch class laptops that saw mild success for a couple of years but is now facing a serious existential crisis.</p></blockquote>
<p>And here was Michael Dell&#39;s <a title="Monday 22nd August 2011: Foresight versus hindsight at Dell" href="http://rubenerd.com/dell-goodbye-hp/">backhanded comment</a> about HP deciding to stop selling PCs, less than 6 months ago, due to falling demand and low profit margins:</p>
<blockquote><p>Goodbye HP, Sorry you donâ€™t want to be in PCs anymore..But we do more than ever. How would you say goodbye to HP?</p></blockquote>
<p>How would you say goodbye to Dell?</p>
