<p>The UTS campus network started getting patchy around lunch time, and by early evening it was slow enough to be largely useless. My poor Cisco tutor instructed us in class to use &quot;best effort&quot; to access our online course material ;).</p>
<p>As of <abbr title="2011-08-23T12:30Z">22:00 AEST</abbr>, it seems their network problems have spilled over to their internet facing site. I hope they can get it fixed soon.</p>
