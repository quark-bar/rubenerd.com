<p><a href="//rubenerd.com/anime-yumekui-merry-05">Yumekui Merry episode five</a> is brought to you by… <strong>Citro&euml;n</strong> and <strong>Toyota</strong>! Maybe?</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>Code Geass, some sort of Railgun anime thing and Angel Beats (from what I&#39;ve been told!) had those blatant deals with Pizza Hut, perhaps JC Staff are getting a cut from automakers! It&#39;s genius! </p>
<p>Then again who needs cars when you&#39;re someone like Merry who can just jump and glide around? And for that matter, would you need cars at all in the dream world? Can dream daemons even apply for drivers licences?</p>

<p>I really should have got into Angel Beats more to satisfy my current obsession with purple. Then again, should I be basing what I watch on… a colour?! I&#39;m sensing a potential anime niche blog idea!</p>
