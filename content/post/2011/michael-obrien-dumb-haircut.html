<p>I&#39;m waiting for confirmation before believing it given <a href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/surely-this-is-a-joke/story-fn7x8me2-1226167552466">The Herald Sun</a> and <a href="http://www.news.com.au/national/surely-this-is-a-joke/story-e6frfkvr-1226167565870">The Australian</a> are reporting it, but apparently insulting the Victorian Gaming Minister <a href="http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/members/id/1660">Michael O&#39;Brien</a> will now land you a fine of roughly $12,000. I&#39;m safe given I&#39;m in New South Wales, right?</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, if you do a Google search for <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=%2412000+fine+o%27brien">$12000 fine O&#39;Brien</a>, you get to <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Billy_Porter_%28criminal%29">this Wikipedia article</a> that states that: <span style="font-style:italic;">&quot;during his imprisonment at Crow Hill, O&#39;Brien&#39;s mother died and left him $12,000.&quot;</span> I&#39;m not sure if this is related.</p>
