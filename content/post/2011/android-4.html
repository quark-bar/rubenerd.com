<blockquote cite="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/18/topolsky-nexus-s"><p>That Topolsky has no major gripes like this about the Galaxy Nexus makes me think Android 4.0 might really be the first good version of Android. Which in turn makes me think Steve Jobs wasnâ€™t far off at the 2007 iPhone introduction when he claimed the iPhone was five years ahead of the competition. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/11/18/topolsky-nexus-s">~ Daring Fireball</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Makes sense then why it&#39;s taking Microsoft an age to formulate a response with Windows Phone. Eric Schmidt was on Apple&#39;s board during the iPhone&#39;s development and had access to all that inside information, and it still took Google this long to develop a polished competitor.</p>
<p>Still, if all the reviews of Android 4 are as positive, I might give it a look again. My beloved WebOS seems to be sinking fast, and as much as I&#39;d love to have a MeeGo/Tizen phone or tablet, I don&#39;t hold out much hope for that either.</p>
