<p>I&#39;ve been studying so much yesterday and today, I had a nightmare about CSMA/CA. I had to shout down all these hallways before I could walk through them. Andrew Cox knows what I&#39;m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>And now for something, completely different</strong>. Well okay, that Monty Python joke didn&#39;t work, because <a href="http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=22625363">the image</a> I billed as being &quot;completely different&quot; <em>preceded</em> the original statement, instead of following it. I so desperately need sleep.</p>
<p>Hey, I also just realised this post had a rhyme in the heading. Swish.</p>
