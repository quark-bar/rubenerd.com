<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/02/14/ie_9_release_candidate_review/">The Register</a>&#39;s conclusions on the latest beta of Internet Explorer 9:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is a good modern browser then &#8211; but do not believe all the hype. The competition is moving faster.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good summary. Progress is being made, but it still performs relatively poorly in standards tests and still feels like too little too late in my books. A company with Microsoft&#39;s resources should have made this progress years ago.</p>
<p>The <strong>Tracking Protection List</strong> sounds like an interesting feature, though I prefer how Mozilla and Google [mostly] are dealing with the issue of advertising opt-outs. I&#39;ll be writing more on that to coincide with some uni studies I&#39;ll be performing on it.</p>
