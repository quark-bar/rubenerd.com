<blockquote><p>Brunei Darussalam is the second least corrupt nation in Asean after Singapore, seventh in Asia-Pacific and at 44th place globally with a score of 5.2, according to the 2011 Transparency International Corruption Perception Index in its report published on Thursday (Dec 1).<br />~ <cite><a href="http://www.bruvoice.com/brunei-news/2011/12/brunei-second-least-corrupt-nation-in-asean/">BruVoice</a></cite>.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s been while since we&#39;ve had a <em>Singapore first</em> and <em>Brunei second</em> story. It&#39;s hardly fair to compare them to the rest of ASEAN, given they&#39;re <strong>the only developed countries in the bloc</strong>. Still, I suppose it makes them feel good!</p>
<p>In other news, the image included is the Brunei Coat of Arms. Literally.</p>
