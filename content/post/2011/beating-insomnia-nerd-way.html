<p>Sometimes when I <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/tag/insomnia/">can&#39;t sleep</a>, I go back into the computer room and gaze at a machine doing something menial and textual for a while. I used to do this with the family DOS computer before I even started school; there&#39;s something about slowly changing characters on a screen in a dark room that&#39;s almostâ€¦ hypnotic.</p>
<p>Memtest[86+] works, SpinRite is also a good one. Back in my Windows days it used to be ScanDisk. In any event, I just watch this Matrix-style stuff go by in slowmo for a short while, and I&#39;m ready to try sleeping again.</p>
<p>Stop looking at me like that.</p>
