<p>From <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing Magazine</a>, which sounds utterly painful, though potentially entertaining for onlookers. Was never a captain, but I <strong>was</strong> in two high school chess clubs!</p>
<p>I&#39;ll admit HTML5 lets you do some amazing stuff right now, but XHTML has XML namespaces, is stricter, cleaner, predictable, makes more senseâ€¦ <strong>to me</strong>. Can&#39;t wait for XHTML5, if it ever comes.</p>
