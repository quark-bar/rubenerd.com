<p>So its April Fools Day. I was wondering how I could top my previous years when I gave glowing reviews for Windows 7 and how Whole Wheat Radio had become a commercial enterprise, but I&#39;m taking a different tack this year.</p>
<p>I will not be making any April Fools jokes on Twitter, nor reading Wikipedia&#39;s April Fools page, and I <strong>certainly won&#39;t be creating an April Fools blog post</strong>. April Fools blog posts are responsible for a shocking decline in productivity and decency this time each year, and I will not afford this nonsensical drivel any of my time here whatsoever.</p>
