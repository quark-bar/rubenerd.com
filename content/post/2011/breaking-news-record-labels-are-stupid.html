<p>After writing a post about George Harrison recently, I was alerted to this paragraph on the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Here_Comes_The_Sun">Here Comes The Sun</a> Wikipedia article:</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<blockquote><p>Astronomer and science popularizer Carl Sagan had wanted <em>[Here Comes The Sun]</em> to be included on the Voyager Golden Record, copies of which were attached to both spacecraft of the Voyager program to provide any entity that recovered them a representative sample of human civilization. Although The Beatles favoured the idea, EMI refused to release the rights and when the probes were launched in 1977 the song was not included.</p>
<p><em>[An EMI spokesman said the decision was due to their small schlongs]</em>.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Face, meet palm</h3>
<p>And these morons wonder why we don&#39;t take them seriously when we try to discuss copyright reform? We need to ditch these glorified mobsters. We also need broader definitions of fair use: in this case so that a member of an alien species can play our music without a bunch of suits in comfy chairs on a tropical island somewhere giving them their personal approval.</p>
<p>I wonder if we were to launch a probe like this now whether the medium we&#39;d encoded some of the cultural evidence of our entire civilisation would have to use some form of DRM. I mean you never know, them aliens might want to make illegal copies. We&#39;d have to include far more specific instructions to decode the DRM than <a title="Voyager Golden Record Cover Explanation" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/File:Voyager_Golden_Record_Cover_Explanation.svg">these though</a>.</p>
<p>Sting asked if the Russians loved their children too. I&#39;d be more interested to know if aliens love the Berne Convention.</p>
