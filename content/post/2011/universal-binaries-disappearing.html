<p>The latest version of <a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/download/">Transmission</a> is reporting availability as an Intel application only now. Firefox 4.0 is [officially] only available as an Intel app, and starting with 4.0.1 the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all.html">download page</a> is using the Finder icon in place of the Universal one.</p>
<p>It took five years, but it seems bigger players are now starting to leave the PowerPC legacy behind. I&#39;ll still be building for both for a while yet though, there are still a lot of souped up PowerMac G5s in use out there.</p>
