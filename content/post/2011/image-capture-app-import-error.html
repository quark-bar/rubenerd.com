<p>Do you get this unhelpful error sometimes when using Image Capture.app? The only solution I&#39;ve found is to <strong>choose a different destination directory for the imported files</strong>, then try again.</p>
<p>Even if your chosen destination folder is on a recognised, writable drive with enough space, this error still crops up sometimes. Another bug that&#39;s lingered around since 10.4 Tiger, so Apple&#39;s developers either aren&#39;t in the mood to fix it, or don&#39;t consider it a priority.</p>
