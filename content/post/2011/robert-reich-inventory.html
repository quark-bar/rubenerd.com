<blockquote cite="http://robertreich.org/post/6355770305"><p>But without more consumer spending, businesses won’t spend more. A robust economy can’t be built on inventory replacements. ~ <a title="Why the President Must Come Up With Demand-Side Solutions, And Not Go Over to the Supply Side" href="http://robertreich.org/post/6355770305">Robert Reich</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly. This is another reason why my American friends should be viewing the <a title="Statement by President Obama on Chrysler’s Repayment" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/05/24/statement-president-obama-chrysler-s-repayment">reports</a> that Chrysler &quot;paid off&quot; their governments debts six years early with nothing but scepticism. Paying off debts due to demand from governments refreshing their car fleets rather than from private consumers is tantamount to smoke and mirrors.</p>
<p>I&#39;d also argue if the US government were serious about creating jobs and helping the environment they&#39;d put people to work improving public transport instead, but that&#39;s just my no good greenie side asserting itself again.</p>
