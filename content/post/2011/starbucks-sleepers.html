<p>Now this is just too cool for words: a <a title="Starbucks Singapore: Green initiatives in stores" href="http://www.starbucks.com.sg/greencafe.html">Starbucks branch in Singapore</a> made from railway sleepers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Reclaimed railroad sleepers from around South-East Asia have been used to line this wall. Where will it live next?</p></blockquote>
<p>The store also uses LEDs for lighting, which are far nicer than those florescent tubes that buzz and make everyone look terrible.</p>
