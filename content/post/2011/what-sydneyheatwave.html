<p>Melbourne has officially exported its fickle weather patterns to Sydney! After our two scorchers (<a title="Entry: Hot enough for you Sydney?" href="http://rubenerd.com/hot-enough-for-you-sydney/">2011.02.01</a>, <a title="Entry: 42 is code for not panicking about heatwaves" href="http://rubenerd.com/42-sydney-heatwave/">2011.02.05</a>), today was a gusty 24 degrees C (75.2 F) with a wind chill factor that sent me back home to grab a jumper. Literally we went from 42 degrees and no wind at all, to 24 degrees and deeply overcast. Those are the same numbers, just in reverse!</p>
<p>From our street in Earlwood we get a pretty good view of the Sydney CBD, so this afternoon I wandered down and took this picture. As I stood there shivering I just couldn&#39;t believe the contrast, from the same vantage point yesterday the sky was blue and I got heatstroke!</p>
<p>In other news, I&#39;ve been told by my contacts in Singapore that it was 32 degrees today. As it was yesterday, and the 365 days before that! Ah seasons, how I forgot yee.</p>
