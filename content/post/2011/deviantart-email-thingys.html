<blockquote><p>Come to Austin, TX and hang out at our devMEET! OR just buy the t-shirt.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Expedia, a flight on United with one stop from Sydney to Austin is $1,636. That&#39;s a pretty expensive meetup and/or shirt ;)</p>
<p>Curiously, the cheapest flight from Singapore to Austin is on All Nippon Airways, probably goes via Narita.</p>
