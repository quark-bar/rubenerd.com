<p>Admittedly my cooking is acceptable, though not fantastic. That said, I do love baking bread, and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/hanezawakirika/status/125529401587810304">@hanezawakirika shared</a> a recipe for a so-called <a href="http://progressivebaker.com/formulas/pretzels.shtm">Soft Sweet Pretzels</a> that looks like something I&#39;ll have to try! </p>
<blockquote><p>Top egg-washed pretzels with coarse sanding sugar before baking, or ice cooled pretzels with fondant icing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their <a href="http://progressivebaker.com/formulas/sourdough.shtm">sourdough</a> also looks amazing.</p>
<p>I&#39;m just ashamed that as someone with a German father, I&#39;d never heard of sweet pretzels before! <em>Das ist sehr nicht gut!</em></p>
