<p>Everyone else already <a href="http://anago.crap.jp/">made their eels</a> days ago, but I thought I&#39;d take the opportunity to create a severely sleep deprived one for myself. I haven&#39;t uploaded it yet, what you see here is a photo of me taken mere minutes ago.</p>
<p>Of course, one would risk churlishness if the the opportunity to quote Ogden Nash were not seized here. Like a… senior manager.</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t mind eels<br />
Except as meals<br />
And the way they feels
