<blockquote><p>The company is really enthused by the increase in engagement by people who are using its Yahoo Mail Beta, which is much faster than the original and incorporates things like social networking</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead of adding social networking to email (which <a title="Google Buzz was a Google Facebook moment" href="http://rubenerd.com/google-buzz-facebook-moment/">Google Buzz</a> and <a href="http://rubenerd.com/goodbye-google-wave/" title="Was Google Wave the SS Great Eastern 2.0?">Wave</a> proved people don&#39;t want), I wish they spent their time implementing the option for HTTPS. Gmail uses it by default and even Live Mail offers it… <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/03/microsoft-shuts-https-hotmail-over-dozen-countries">in some places, some of the time</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had a similar experience to Steve Gibson, when I&#39;ve tested Firesheep in cafes, unsecured Yahoo Mail accounts are by and away the most prevalent. Yahoo especially owes their paid customers some sorely needed action on this; John and Jane Doe won&#39;t fire up a VPN just to check their email in a public place, nor should they be expected to. I do, but I&#39;m a tin-foil-hat nerd.</p>
