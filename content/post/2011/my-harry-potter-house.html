<p>Having just come back exhausted from it, I decided to post my photos from <a href="https://plus.google.com/103111529237727959050/posts/ZJwb2qFmBGk">SMASH!</a> tomorrow, and to write a brief <em>post of the day</em>. To celebrate the fact my friends are off to see the last Harry Potter tonight, I did <a href="http://www.thealmightyguru.com/Reviews/HarryPotter/Docs/Quiz-House.html">this quiz</a>.</p>
<p>I gave up on Harry Potter after I found <em>The Order of The Phoenix</em> to be a long winded, watered down disappointment (in my opinion), but I can live with Ravenclaw!</p>
<p>One of the questions I had as a kid was whether I could be a renegade, or be in my own house. Why should I have to conform to one in particular? Needless to say, nobody thought it was a good idea.</p>
