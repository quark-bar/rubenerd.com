<p>Been trying the FreeBSD 9.0 release candidate for several days now, and I&#39;ve been absolutely blown away.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>So simple and lovely!</h3>
<p>When I first read on the mailing lists that sysinstall was to be replaced with something else, I&#39;ll admit I was a little terrified. In a world of overly complex, flaky and resource heavy graphical installation tools, sysinstall was visually unappealing but it got the job done even on modest hardware. I&#39;d seen some screenshots of a FreeBSD graphical installer, and like the curmudgeon I am, I took a disliking.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the bsdinstall system that has replaced it assuaged all my fears. In a word, it&#39;s beautiful. Simple, clean, elegant, quintessentially BSD. That was more than one word, forgive me I couldn&#39;t resist. As someone who also <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/netbsd/">dabbles in NetBSD</a> from time to time, it&#39;s my opinion FreeBSD finally has an installer equally as nice. </p>
<p>Visually, the navigation is clearer and the screens more logically laid out. For someone coming from Linux the lack of a graphical install may seem jarring, but I&#39;d argue the new installer is just as easy to use &#8212; perhaps a little moreso &#8212; than any I&#39;ve used on Linux.</p>
<h3>Guided Partition Editor</h3>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/icon.freebsd-logo.png" alt="" style="height:175px; width:178px; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" class="transparent" />The new <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/bsdinstall-partitioning.html">Guided Partition Editor</a> is a pleasure to use even if you&#39;re not a beginner, for one primary reason that rhymes with &quot;kernel&quot; and &quot;blurnal&quot;. Wait, that&#39;s not a word.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve ever done that hack of setting up multiple swap partitions so you can reboot and create <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-current/2006-June/064043.html">gjournals</a>, the installer now lets you define softupdates as well as softupdate journals (UFS SU+J which has made its appearance in FreeBSD 9, more on that in a future post). TRIM support is also built in and selectable from the installer now. As I said on Twitter, I jumped up and <a href="http://twitpic.com/7dya2s">started dancing</a>!</p>
<h3>Easy to install jails</h3>
<p>I also haven&#39;t had time to check this out yet, but this one line in the BSDInstall manpage made my jaw drop.</p>
<blockquote><p>
TARGETS</p>
<p>jail destination<br />
Sets up a new chroot system at destination, suitable for use with jail(8). Behavior is generally similar to auto, except that disk partitioning and network setup are skipped and a kernel is not installed into the new system.
</p></blockquote>
<p>For those who are unaware, jails are one of the most wonderful and elegant features of FreeBSD, and the #1 thing I miss when I use Linux. I run my torrent client, web server and file servers in their own jails on my headless server, they&#39;re infinitely simpler to set up and maintain than VMs and provide excellent security. Now they&#39;ll be even simpler!</p>
<p>FreeBSD is a beautiful operating system, and with the addition of this new installer, I&#39;m hoping more people will give it a try :).</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more commentary and fun with FreeBSD 9. As I said on Twitter, I haven&#39;t been this excited by a FreeBSD release in a long while. I might even give it a try on my ThinkPad again, given the latest release of Fedora broke my graphics.</p>
