<p><a href="http://www.tipb.com/2011/06/04/apple-hires-mobilenotifier-developer-peter-hajas/">TiPb is reporting</a> that Apple has hired MobileNotifier developer Peter Hajas. A well known figure in the jailbreaking community who has long shown Apple how notifications should be done, presumably he&#39;s been hired by Apple to… show them how notifications should be done. This has always been a serious weakness in the iOS UI, and I&#39;m hoping he&#39;ll get them on the right track.</p>
<p>Meantime, the most critical and underreported aspect of this story was… his vest and jacket combination. And how I want them both. Actually, I could go for his glasses, shirt, tie, the whole ensemble. I want to look like that. Anybody want to lend me a hand?</p>
