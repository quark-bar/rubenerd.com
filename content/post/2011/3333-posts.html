<p>I reached 2222 posts in October 2009 (<a href="//rubenerd.com/2222-goodbye-geocities/">2222 posts, and goodbye to GeoCities</a>), and as I recall I spent much of <strong>that</strong> post imagining what my 3333rd post would be about. Fast forward to now, and I spent post 3333 reviewing <a href="//rubenerd.com/anime-yumekui-merry-04/">Yumekui Merry #04</a>, with <strong>no mention</strong> of 3333. Gosh darn it! Did you get me my Cheez Whiz boy? And so forth.</p>
<p>Wonder whether I&#39;ll remember 4444.</p>
