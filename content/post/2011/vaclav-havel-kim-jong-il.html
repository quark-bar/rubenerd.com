<p>In the space of 48 hours, we lost two figures so pivotal in the post-Soviet world, or as Mr Havel referred to as &quot;Post-Totalitarianism&quot;. The two men could not have been more different.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>One worked in the Czech underground forming a resistance to Soviet influence, and left behind a peaceful, democratic, developed country with the highest living standards in the former Communist Bloc. He was an author, a playwright, a poet, a visionary, a jazz man, and a humanitarian.</p>
<p>The other man, was Kim Jong Il. Sadly, the recently deceased <a title="Saturday 17th December 2011: Christopher Hitchens, 1949-2011" href="//rubenerd.com.com/christopher-hitchens/">Christopher Hitchens</a> would no doubt have had a brilliant line to describe Kim&#39;s passing. He traveled to North Korea, and often spoke at length of Kim&#39;s cult of personality. Here&#39;s hoping Korean can one day regain her peace.</p>
<p>Farewell Mr Havel. I&#39;m downloading your <em>Charter 77</em> to read on my Kindle as we speak.</p>
<p><strong>UPDADE:</strong> <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2010/s2906276.htm">Here is a transcript</a> of Mark Colvin interviewing Christopher Hitchens about North Korea in 2010.</p>
