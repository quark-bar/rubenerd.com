<p>After my fairly disparaging posts about Chrome <a title="View all posts tagged with Google Chrome" href="//rubenerd.com/tag/google-chrome/">recently</a> I was feeling bad for it, so I installed <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home">Chromium</a> on my Linux Thinkpad again, but soon realised why I didn&#39;t use it: Chromium doesn&#39;t respect GTK&#39;s font anti-aliasing settings. There could be a solution to this, but I don&#39;t really see the point when <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> works beautifully. And <a href="http://kazehakase.sourceforge.jp/">Kazehakase</a>, which I&#39;d use if I weren&#39;t so enamoured with NoScript :).</p>
<p>As an aside, I think Chrome and Chromium are really only usable (from a UI perspective) on the Mac because they&#39;re forced to have full menus. Ditto with Microsoft Office. Well, not that I use that either ;).</p>
