<blockquote><p>PayPal-founder Peter Thiel was so inspired by Atlas Shrugged &#8211; Ayn Rand’s novel about free-market capitalism &#8211; that he’s trying to make its title a reality.</p>
<p>The Silicon Valley billionaire has funnelled $1.25 million to the Seasteading Institute, an organization that aspires to launch a floating colony into international waters, freeing them and like-minded thinkers to live by Libertarian ideals.</p>
<p>Mr Thiel and his colleagues say their ocean state would have no welfare, looser building codes, no minimum wage, and few restrictions on weapons. ~ <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2024761/Atlas-Shrugged-Silicon-Valley-billionaire-reveals-plan-launch-floating-start-country-coast-San-Francisco.html">Mail Online</a></p></blockquote>
<p>A 19th century nirvana. Libertarianism: anarchy for rich people.</p>
