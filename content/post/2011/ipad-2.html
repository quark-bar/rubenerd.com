<p>Because I&#39;m a good little Apple slave, here are my thoughts.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>Ruben you such fanboy lol !111eleven!11pretzel!1!!</h3>
<p>First, Apple demonstrates once again they&#39;re the leader and everyone else is a follower… at least for now. Before the iPad, tablet computers were limited to heavy old laptops running desktop OSs with a thin layer of pen computing as an afterthought added to it. The CrunchPad JooJoo thing (that did more to damage Singapore&#39;s IT reputation overseas than anything in a long time) was perhaps a sign of things to come from at least a form factor perspective, but it was severely limited by design to be a web machine, conventional wisdom at the time dictating that its all anyone would want to do on a machine like that.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, and every man and his dog is coming out with tablet computers either running a flavour of Android or webOS that uses Plastic Fantastic instead of metal. If I may be so snarky, I&#39;m sure those manufacturers and Google was hotly awaiting the release of iPad 2 more than anyone else, so they can start figuring out ways to duplicate it.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>If they&#39;re out to duplicate features, this release shouldn&#39;t take them too much time. Or at least less than the entire year it took for Motorola to release the Zune or Xoom or whatever it is.</p>
<p>When I navigated to Apple.com this morning while getting ready for class, I was presented with a full screen graphic of an iPad 2… cover. For such an allegedly amazing new device, it struck me as odd that a so called &quot;Smart Cover&quot; would get so much advertising attention. It may be nice, but its a cover! I suppose its a &quot;magical&quot; and &quot;revolutionary&quot; cover ;).</p>
<p>Needless to say, heavily advertising a cover suggested to me that we were looking more at a 1.1 revision rather than a 2.0 product, otherwise they&#39;d be hyping a ton of breakthrough new features.</p>

<p>Mugi, you don&#39;t use a pen with an iPad! Geez ;).</p>
<p>The dual core CPU is obviously a nice addition and will do doubt drastically improve performance, though I&#39;ve always been wary of Apple&#39;s claims such as &quot;nine times faster&quot;. The technical specifications don&#39;t list memory, though I&#39;m assuming that&#39;s also been bumped up.</p>
<p>One of the criticisms I&#39;ve heard from people with iPads is once they buy an iPhone 4, the screen is so much clearer and easy to read that going back to the iPad is a bit of a shock. When one considers the iPad is 1024&#215;768 and a <strong>telephone</strong> is almost the same at 960&#215;640, the fact the iPad 2 still has the same resolution is a tad disappointing. I suppose they have their reasons, to power such a high res screen you&#39;d need pretty decent graphics that would either make it too expensive, too hot or use too much battery.</p>
<p>Cameras? Why? So people can video chat in the most unflattering way possible, or walk around taking pictures with a dinner tray as Andy Ihnatko so eloquently put it? I suppose cameras and HDMI will appease people who buy devices based on a features list.</p>
<h3>The final word</h3>
<p>You expected me to say <strong>The Bird is The Word</strong>? Really? You think I&#39;d be that predictable and actually write in a post that <strong>The Bird is The Word</strong>? I&#39;m as shocked as I am appalled. Hey, wait a minute.</p>
<p>Overall it looks like a solid update, and as much as I&#39;d love one, I still won&#39;t be buying one. I just splurged on a refurbished Mac Pro, I won&#39;t be buying any new hardware for a LONG while yet. Besides my MacBook Pro, ThinkPad X40 and iPhone 4 are wonderful travel companions, so I don&#39;t need one. I&#39;m also still a Palm fanboy, so I would actually really love one of their TouchPads. Don&#39;t tell anyone.</p>
