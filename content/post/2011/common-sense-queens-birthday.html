<p>Hope you had a properous Queen&#39;s Birthday, if you were in [most of] Australia. Folks in WA, the UK, Canada and New Zealand already had theirs. As I <a href="//rubenerd.com/queens-birthday/">said in 2009</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don’t you just love living in a commn [sic] sense monarchy? :)</p></blockquote>
<p>Dang typos. Speaking of mistakes, I&#39;m also 99% sure that isn&#39;t a picture of Her Majesty. Maybe someone from Ireland can help me out, didn&#39;t she just visit you?</p>
