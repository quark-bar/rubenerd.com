<p>Are you Alaskan and worried that your country&#39;s credit rating may spill over to you? Not to fear, according to the graphic above from <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2011/08/06/news/international/sp_rating_countries_with_aaa/index.htm" title="Ouch! U.S. booted from Triple-A debt club"> CNN Money</a> at 2:52 PM Eastern US time, you&#39;re still AAA! I&#39;m still awaiting confirmation from Bloomberg and CNBC.</p>
<p>In other news, I love that Singapore is represented in &quot;The AAA Club&quot; with <strong>a single dark pixel</strong>. Very generous, considering its land area barely qualities it for a subpixel rendered on the edge of a glyph let alone an entire pixel. Must be all that land reclamation.</p>
