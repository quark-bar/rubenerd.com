<p><strong>Ichi.</strong> While messing around in MySQL this afternoon, I accidentally duplicated thirty blog entries which appeared in the RSS feed and spammed you all. This has been fixed. Thank you to Andrew Middleton and <a href="http://ediblehat.wordpress.com/">@edible_hat</a> for telling me!</p>
<p><strong>Zwei.</strong> I merged my fun little puzzles blog into Rubenerd.com to save me time, and redirected the <a href="//rubenerd.com/puzzles/feed/">RSS feed</a>. You can view the entries in their <a href="//rubenerd.com/puzzles/">new category here</a>… if you really want to ;).</p>
<p><strong>Tree.</strong> Despite missing two days this month due to technical issues, I’m still pressing on with my <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/postaday2011">#PostADay2011</a> challenge! 363 days isn’t as cool as 365, but I’m up for it :)</p>
