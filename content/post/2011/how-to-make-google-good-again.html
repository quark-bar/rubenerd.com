<p>Earlier this month <a href="http://www.h-online.com/open/features/How-to-make-Google-good-again-1228600.html">Glyn Moody</a> wrote a great post on how Google could be a force for good again, in particular by reversing the trends in their definition of open, in Android, with OpenStreetMap, the principal behind Google Books, and with patents. I&#39;d add greater privacy controls in Chrome rather than just retorting that smart people use Chromium, bringing DoubleClick under control, and paying taxes.</p>
<p>I used to have great respect and admiration for Google (as you can tell by reading my old material here!) and I still hold them in higher regard than most companies, but cynicism regarding their do not be evil mantra set in around 2009. Unlike some though, I have every confidence they can reverse the trend.</p>
