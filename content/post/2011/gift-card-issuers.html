<p>Al Lewis of Market Watch discussing the <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/christmas-gifts-are-stupid-scrooge-economist-says-2011-12-23">alleged stupidity</a> of holiday presents:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/christmas-gifts-are-stupid-scrooge-economist-says-2011-12-23"><p>But there are some economic inefficiencies to gift cards too. Among them: About 10% of gift-card value is never claimed, Waldfogel wrote, and retailers can’t book the unclaimed cards as revenues for years.</p></blockquote>
