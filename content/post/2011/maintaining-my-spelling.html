<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/icon.tango.swissarmyknife.png" alt="" style="height:128px; width:128px; float:right;" class="transparent" /> Here&#39;s a question. How come <strong>maintain</strong>, <strong>maintained</strong>, <strong>maintaining</strong> and <strong>maintainable</strong> have an &quot;ai&quot; at the end, but <strong>maintenance</strong> just has an &quot;e&quot;? I&#39;m constantly spelling it <strong>maintainence</strong>. Is it just so spell checkers can mock me each time I spell it wrong? </p>
<p>And before anyone says &quot;because you don&#39;t say it that way&quot;, since when has the spelling of a word in English got in the way of its pronunciation? Sheesh, what a bunch of knights.</p>
<p>Our language is weird, I maintain.</p>
