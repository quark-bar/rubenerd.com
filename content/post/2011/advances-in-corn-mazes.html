<p>With 15 days left to go before closing his blog, J-Walk has already started to descend into puns with a link to a site discussing the growing trend of <a href="http://j-walkblog.com/index.php?/weblog/posts/Advances_In_Corn_Mazes/">corn mazes</a>. Yes, actual corn mazes. I&#39;ll admit, it grew on me.</p>
<p>In any case, those interested in maizes (darn it, now he has me doing it) should be a <a href="http://maps.google.com.sg/maps?q=Kuala+Lumpur,+Federal+Territory+of+Kuala+Lumpur,+Malaysia+@3.139003,101.686855">pedestrian in Kuala Lumpur</a>. The shape and intersection of their road network could be used as a source of high entropy random numbers.</p>
