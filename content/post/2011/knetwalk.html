<p>Since <a title="Saturday 27th August 2011: Iâ€™m back on KDE again" href="http://rubenerd.com/back-on-kde-again/">moving back to KDE</a>, I&#39;ve been reacquainted with a lot of my old favourite applications, and perhaps none are as awesome as the <a href="http://games.kde.org/">KDE Games</a>, <a href="http://games.kde.org/game.php?game=knetwalk">KNetWalk</a> in particular. If you&#39;ve ever played Pipe Dream from the Windows Entertainment Pack days, the gameplay should be a little familiar. Essentially, you&#39;re connecting all the chips to the power source.</p>
<p>Insanely addictive. If you&#39;re a KDE fan, install KDE Games from your package manager and launch it from the <em>&quot;Tactics and Strategy&quot;</em> menu.</p>
