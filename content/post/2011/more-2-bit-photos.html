<p>I had so much fun rendering that 2 bit photo for my Binary 11:11 11/11/11 post, I thought I&#39;d do the same thing for 23:11 11/11/11. For those 12 hour folks, that&#39;s 11:11pm you see ;).</p>

<p>Obviously a mixed success! I suppose it was too dark to get a good shot of the UTS building, having just finished my last exam there for the semester. Irony is, my first major test was on the 01/11/11. </p>

<p>Then it was off to Starbucks for a celebratory Toffee Nut Latte. As I mentioned on Twitter this evening, TNLs were one of my favourite Christmas treats growing up in Singapore, and now I can get them here :&#39;)</p>

<p>Because I&#39;m a loser, the first thing I did having done my exam was to jump onto my laptop with the coffee in my hand. Given my abject clumsiness, I&#39;m surprised how few times I&#39;ve destroyed equipment with this beverage!</p>

<p>Then it was time to take the train home from Central (with a brief stop at Circular Quay to take that first photo!)</p>

<p>From the bright lights of the city to dark suburbia. Then across the street home :).</p>

<p>Larger images <a href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/photo.mine.1111111111.full.png">look far better</a> in 2 bit than these small ones, but it was still a lot of fun! </p>
<p>I reckon you could be really creative with 2 bit colour depth if you knew how to capture the right conditions for an ideal conversion. Even compared to monochromatic photography, you&#39;d be looking for completely different things, such as ruthlessly heavy contrast and normalisation.</p>
