I&#39;d been <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Rubenerd/statuses/135536563512811520">wondering</a> on The Twitters who they might get, and whether they&#39;d have the same bad luck as the Greeks.</p>
<p>A split second search in the <a title="Mario Monti on Wikipedia" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Mario_Monti">Book of Knowledge</a> turned up this.</p>
<blockquote><p>Monti is an international adviser to Goldman Sachs</p></blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re not even trying any more.</p>
