<p>I&#39;ve been watching <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/tag/gurren-lagann/">Gurren Lagann</a> for two weeks now, and I&#39;m so thorougly absorbed in their universe. One of the great things about limiting yourself to one episode a day ^^.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>
<p><strong>Plot:</strong> An epic 13 episode journey started by a boy and a young man in a subterranean village culminates in a final showdown between the fortresses of two of the generals, and the valiant crew of the Dai-Gurren. Victory is in sight, but can they comprehend what they&#39;ve unleashed? Can <em>I</em> even comprehend it?!</p>
<p>
<p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Despite having one of the most powerful weapons in the fleet, and despite being given the biggest pounding yet, Yoko seemingly preferred to stay on the bridge of Dai-Gurren and narrate what was going on to us. Now that I think about it, often she didn&#39;t even do that, she just provided facial expressions while other bridge officers told her what was going on. Poor show Yoko ;).</p>

<p>
<p><strong>Tactics:</strong> Compared to previous episodes where an all-out offensive seems to be the winning ticket, the sheer number of enemy ships causes Simon to pull rank and fight them himself, relegating the defence of Dai-Gurren to the others.</p>
<p>
<p><strong>Art:</strong> Given the predominant theme of the episode was &quot;blow evil ships up&quot; we had quite a fireworks display. Mostly Gainax showed off their light effects, particularly when Gurren Lagann powered up to take on the millions of avian ships.</p>
<p><img src="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.gl1403.jpg" alt="" style="height:278px; width:500px;" /></p>
<p>
<p><strong>Common sense:</strong> I know The Generals have their pride to maintain and didn&#39;t want to dignify these humans with too much firepower, but why didn&#39;t they use two of their fortresses in the first place? They could have crushed these silly little humans ages ago! Pride cometh before the fall.</p>
<p>
<p><strong>Technology:</strong> Sometimes a low tech solution is better than a more sophisticated one. When a gigantic Gunmen needs to traverse water, what better thing to arm oneself with than a giantic paddle? When communication lines are down, what better thing to use than a projector aimed at a swirling cloud of dust to attract attention?</p>

<p>
<p><strong>Friends:</strong> Having inspired other humans to the surface with their antics, at a critical moment (of course!) our heros are joined by an armada of friendly ships ready to assist in taking their enemies down. A good thing, given it seemed they had no hope otherwise.</p>

<p>
<p><strong>Nostalgia:</strong> Seeing Simon use tha late Kamina&#39;s passionate rallying cry was one thing, but to see Nia show that spirit was quite another. By the way, Nia is absolutely adorable, and I&#39;m abashedly a fan ^^.</p>
<p>
<p><strong>Partnerships:</strong> I really didn&#39;t think Rossiu/Simon stood a chance piloting Gurren Lagann together after the epicness that was Kamina/Simon, but they&#39;ve turned out to be quite the formidable duo. Over the two weeks I&#39;ve been watching this series, they&#39;ve both come such a long way.</p>
<p><img src="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.gl1406.jpg" alt="" style="height:278px; width:500px;" /></p>
<p>
<p><strong>Unanswered questions:</strong> The Dai-Gurren crew have a sophisticated armada of Gunmen, but given they were all claimed from fallen enemies at some point, they&#39;re a hodgepodge mix of devices with different shapes, sizes, capabilities and epicness. When they meet their new human allies, not only do they have far more ships, but they&#39;re all uniform in shape, size, capability and epicness. Did these humans raid a factory?</p>
<p>
<p><strong>Cliff hanger:</strong> Several episodes ago I commented that the Spiral King looked as though he was standing in either a gigantic ship with columns, or a city. With the destruction of the Teppelin Capital, these giant columns with windows (slabs, if you will) proceed to fall from the sky, revealing a horrified facial expression. A homage to <em>2001: A Space Odyssey?</em></p>

<p>
<p><strong>Heart tugging:</strong> Seeing Simon and Yoko looking onto their memorial for Kamina, with his sword and cape. I hope he&#39;s able to keep that promise.</p>
<p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The known world is coming apart at the seams. What will be the implications? I have the feeling we&#39;re about to have our minds blown.</p>
