<p>Guilty Crown has copped flack (<a title="Sunday 16th October 2011[Anime] Guilty Crown" href="//rubenerd.com/anime-guilty-crown/">even from me</a>) as sounding rather like a Code Geass clone, though already they can boast having two things the other series didn&#39;t: an epic logo, and an entirely useless post written by Ruben on the train in a half-asleep daze.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>I did logo programming back in the day</h3>
<p>As is evidenced by the images in my sidebar (which are being <a title="Thursday 20th October 2011: Rubénerd.com has a mascot!" href="//rubenerd.com/rubenerd-mascot/">replaced soon</a>!) and various <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/logos/">other posts</a> on the subject, I am somewhat enamored with logos. Particularly ones that show my allegiances, such as <em>Houkago Tea Time</em>, the now infamously retro <em>SOS-Dan</em>, the Federation&#39;s <em>Starfleet Planetary Sciences Division</em>, and presumably many more.</p>
<p>Having only seen Guilty Crown in passing in the UTS Anime club (I was too busy transferring legitimately purchased content across laptops to watch), I can&#39;t be sure whether this logo is their official one or not. For all I know, someone on one of the larger image boards could be having a lend of me, which I thought only libraries could do. Bad pun sorry, I could have done better.</p>

<h3>My other point</h3>
<p>Point is, several in the aforementioned club have heaped nothing but praise, and I have every intention of watching it. Especially if the logo is that cool. I&#39;m sorry, but it has that retro futuristic vibe, the shape is eerily Star Trek-esque in it&#39;s appearance and… wait, hold on a minute. Of course a <strong>shape</strong> is something in <strong>appearance</strong>, shapes have <strong>nothing but appearance</strong>!</p>
<p>See what happens when I go for two nights with 4 hours sleep?</p>
<h3>Oh yeah that reminds me</h3>
<p>Are you still following this fractured post? If you&#39;re not, that&#39;s okay, fractured posts sound rather painful. The only time I&#39;ve ever broken a bone was in high school when a friend of mine inadvertently whacked me in the foot with a hockey stick. I earned new found respect for Canadian athletes that day.</p>
<p>So I was doing a Google search for Guilty Crown to get a feel for the art style, and one of the first results I got <a href="http://terrymarotta.wordpress.com/2011/08/14/">was this</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/room-with-a-view.jpg" alt="" style="height:216px; width:500px;" /></p>
<p>While the colour in this image is rather nice, and the house it depicts looks perfectly hospitable, unfortunately it wasn&#39;t quite what I was looking for. Judging from the text that accompanied the photo it was easy to see why I was directed to this post:</p>
<blockquote><p>AND a big head from the Crown Royal. AND a guilty conscience […]</p></blockquote>
<p>While I believe they may have a point regarding nice colours in Guilty Crown&#39;s art and character designs, I hardly think the characters have big heads. Impossible clothing maybe, but not big heads.</p>

<p>Which reminds me, Talking Heads is an awesome band. David Byrne should have learned Japanese and sung the opening theme.</p>
<p>Thank you, and goodnight.</p>
