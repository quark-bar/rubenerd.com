<p>I love travelling through Sydney&#39;s <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Museum_railway_station">Museum Station</a>, partly because it&#39;s the quietest one on the <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/City_Circle">City Circle</a>, but also for their classic advertisements from decades past, and their monthly displays. The <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Singapore_MRT">Singapore MRT</a> was only built in the late 1980s, so its a novelty for me!</p>
<p>A simple display for winter, but I like it! Can I get a print of this for our house? :D</p>
