<p>8.5 billion USD (about 1.2 million AUD) seems excessive, especially when one considers the vast majority of its customers that defenders of the deal so readily bring upâ€¦ don&#39;t pay a cent. Still, we&#39;ll wait and see how Windows Internet Phone Messenger and its seven new editions fare under new ownership.</p>
<p>My two questions are: Microsoft learned from eBay&#39;s mistake and bought the Skype protocol as well as the company right? And secondly, is SIP finally up to the task of replacing it? And thirdly, what will No Agenda and TWiT do? Wait, that was three questions.</p>
