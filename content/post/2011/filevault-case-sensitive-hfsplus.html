<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/icon.filevault.png" alt="FileVault" style="float:right; height:128px; width:128px; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" class="transparent" />If you’re a *nix nerd like me, you most likely formatted your Mac with the non-standard case sensitive variant of <a title="Apple.com: About Mac OS Extended Volume Hard Drive Format or HFS+" href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1604">HFS+</a> (ala Mac OS Extended), which FileVault doth protest too much about if you try to enable it on an existing account.</p>
<p>Fortunately there’s a workaround: simply create a new user account and click the &quot;Turn on FileVault protection&quot; checkbox. If you’re installing OS X from scratch, its simply a matter of creating a temporary account with the installer, using it to create your real account, then deleting the temporary one.</p>
