<p><a href="http://rubenerd.com/qemu-ad-lib-midi-win-31/">Speak of the devil</a>, Wikipedia has a photo of an <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/File:Adlib.jpg">AdLib sound card</a> from 1990, in all its ISA glory! </p>
<p>Granted it was merely an interface and vessel for a general PC to use the Yamaha YM3812 sound chip, but for the time it must have been pretty exciting to hear that level of detail on a PC. Home computers like the Commodore 64 already had sophisticated MOS synthesiser chips since the early 1980s, but Big Blue made <em>work machines!</em></p>
