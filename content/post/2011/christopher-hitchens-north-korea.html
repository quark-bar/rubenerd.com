<p>When I commented on the alleged <a title="Monday 19th December 2011: VÃ¡clav Havel and Kim Jong Il" href="http://rubenerd.com/vaclav-havel-kim-jong-il/">death of Kim Jong Il</a>, I lamented that Christopher Hitchens wouldn&#39;t be around to comment on it. Fortunately, we have video of him discussing North Korea at <em>Politics and Prose</em> in 2007, with his trademark wit and humility.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t begin to imagine what being a North Korean would be like. To have been born on the wrong side of the wall, even worse than my German relatives <em>almost</em> were. It depresses me no end.</p>
