<p>Sometimes I find it fun to trawl through the Rub&eacute;nerd archives and see what I thought was interesting years ago! In this case, this was what I discussed five years ago:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://rubenerd.com/first-blu-ray-disc-drive-won%E2%80%99t-play-blu-ray-movies/">First Blu-ray Disc Drive Wonâ€™t Play Blu-ray Movies</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rubenerd.com/songs-names-with-song-in-them/">Songs Names with Song in Them on Wikipedia</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting how far we&#39;ve come. BD movies still aren&#39;t supported by too many computers, and that Wikipedia article is long gone. Good thing I quoted it :).</p>
