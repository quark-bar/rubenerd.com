<p>Android may overwhelmingly be the target for malware in the mobile space, but as usual the media have got the details wrong!</p>

<h3>Kyubey has the Android logo’s eyes and ears!</h3>
<p>McAfee&#39;s Threat Report for the second quarter of 2011 (<a href="http://www.mcafee.com/us/resources/reports/rp-quarterly-threat-q2-2011.pdf">PDF link</a>) listed iOS as having no malware, and Android as having an <em>order of magnitude</em> more malware than any other platform. Understandably, the media have pounced on the latter… well, not as much as they would have if it were iOS, but still.</p>
<p>While I&#39;m not an Android fan, the problem here isn&#39;t the OS but the OEMs that distribute it. It can be an unclear distinction for most consumers who just see &quot;phones&quot; (which is why the whole iOS versus Android debate is silly) but it&#39;s important.</p>
<p>While tech savvy folk would presumably prefer an unmodified copy of Android installed on their phones (the Microsoft Signature Experience, but for Google), their third party PlaysForSure hardware manufacturers have a vested interest in differentiating their products from the competition. This may come in the form of alternative user interfaces, additional applications, and/or modified defaults and branding… all of which would need to be thoroughly tested for compatibility with any Android updates.</p>

<h3>They say Branding, she’s a fine girl…</h3>
<p>Unlike vertically integrated manufacturers like Apple and RIM that can push updates to all compatible devices as soon as they&#39;re made available, official Android updates have to be made available by these manufacturers, some of which are better Android citizens than others. </p>
<p>This middle man approach unavoidably introduces a delay, which is why a startling percentage of Android devices are still running older versions of the OS. It&#39;s not Google&#39;s fault, or the fault of consumers.</p>
<p>This potentially may have been one of the reasons why Google bought Motorola: by being the manufacturer they could ensure the latest software updates are always made available for their devices, and in a quick and timely fashion. They have experience with pushing regular updates with Google Chrome, this would allow them to do this on mobile hardware as well.</p>
<p>Given the closed direction of Android they&#39;ve started with Honeycomb, it could be another reason for OEMs to worry.</p>
