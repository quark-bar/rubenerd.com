<p><a href="http://cnet.com/">CNET</a> was one of the first websites I visited when we first got internet in the 1990s. I was horrified (mortified even) when they replaced their uniquely tech-retro typeface with a generic font a few years ago.</p>
<p>Needless to say, a horrendously egregious error seems to have finally been corrected! I applaud CNET for re-introducting their classic logo, and restoring a part of my childhood :). Now they just need to do something about the overwrought, ZDNet-esque site design, and <a href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.cnetjs.2011.png">degrade gracefully</a> when people access their site without JavaScript.</p>
