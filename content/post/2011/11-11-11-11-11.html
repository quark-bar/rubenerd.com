<p>Despite the frequent occurance of a certain digit this evening (and this morning) in certain timekeeping circles with <strong>11:11 11/1/11</strong>, today wasn&#39;t so big for me because I write my dates the Singaporean way. I grew up with it, the other way looks weird ;).</p>
<p><strong>11:11AM on the 11th of November 2011</strong> will be more exciting.</p>
