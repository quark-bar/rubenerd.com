<p>A <strong>Specialized Hardrock Sport Disc</strong>. White and chocolate/coffee brown. Haven&#39;t decided a name for her yet. Really pretty :)</p>
<p>I&#39;ve ridden bikes in the past, but they&#39;ve all been rentals or bike sharing deals. And the adage that you never forget how to ride a bike? Pure BS! Obviously I&#39;ll be re-learning before tackling anything difficult. Or mediocre. Or beginner!</p>
