<p>Presumably to satisfy some warped sense of humour, my lecturers set this week as the due date for a dizzying number of assignments and class tests. As a result, I&#39;ve had far less time to write blog posts, including my <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/gurren-lagann/">Gurren Lagann</a> reviews. By Wednesday this week I&#39;ll be free again, and rather exhausted!</p>
<p>I belabour this to say I took a quick study break to <a href="https://webifyme.org/en-US/collage/fd890471ccad/">Webify</a> myself. Aside from the car magazine instead of a <em>Linux Journal</em> or similar (see what I did there?), I&#39;m liking it!</p>
