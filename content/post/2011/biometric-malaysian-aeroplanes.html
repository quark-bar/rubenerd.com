<p>If you&#39;ll be travelling through Malaysia, what can you be expecting over the coming months for <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/10/isaac_asimov_on.html">security theatre</a> and whatnot?</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">(Screenshot is from my FreeBSD MacBook Pro when I was using it with the airport’s WiFi. It was <a href="http://rubenerd.com/kuala-lumpur-international-airport-wifi-is-sweet/">January 2007</a> and I was obsessed with the Haruhi Suzumiya anime, as I’m sure many of us were!)</p>
<h3>So here’s the problem</h3>
<p>We <a href="http://www.springwise.com/tourism_travel/malaysia-introduces-world%E2%80%99s-on-board-biometric-immigration-checks/">start our flight on SpringWise</a>, the blog for entrepreneural ideas. As George W. Bush said, its a shame the French don&#39;t have a word for those types of people</p>
<blockquote><p>Travelers around the world are familiar with the delays caused by airport immigration checks, and Kuala Lumpur International Airport’s Low-Cost Carrier Terminal (LCCT) is no exception, with wait times of over 45 minutes long during peak periods. </p></blockquote>
<p>The understatement of the Millennium, so much so I think Robbie Williams even sang a song about it. The few times I flew ValueAir and AirAsia when we lived in KL and I&#39;d visit folks in Singapore, I had to use the terminal. Aside from almost missing a flight because it&#39;s nigh impossible to find the transit bus you need to take from <a href="http://rubenerd.com/kuala-lumpur-international-airport-wifi-is-sweet/">KLIA</a>, I remember one time sitting in that massive departure hall for an hour and a half.</p>
<h3>So here’s the solution</h3>
<p>Anyway, how will you be solving this? Let&#39;s <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2011/10/30/nation/9803647&#038;sec=nation">proceed to The Star</a>, the English rag I used to read over there that managed to have a picture of <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Abdullah_Ahmad_Badawi">Pak Lah</a> on the front page of every single issue.</p>
<blockquote><p>KUALA LUMPUR: The Immigration department will introduce on-board checks in planes to ease the passenger load at the counters at the Low-Cost Carrier Terminal (LCCT) in Sepang, especially during peak travel seasons.</p></blockquote>
<p>On-board cheques? Where can I get some of these? :D</p>
<blockquote><p>The on-board biometric checks claimed by the department to be the first of its kind in the world is one of its long term measures to improve operations at the LCCT.</p></blockquote>
<p>Uh oh, we&#39;ve experienced a sudden loss of cabin pressure and have to make an emergency landing. </p>
<p>I assume my biometric data will be kept on an ultra secure medium that could never leak out, right? Because that&#39;s the problem with biometrics, I can&#39;t change the password on my finger. Funny how often people forget that.</p>
<p>Will be keeping an eye on this. I&#39;d very much like to avoid the low cost terminal there at all costs, but one can assume once the government has declared the trial a raging success they&#39;ll introduce it across all flights arriving and leaving the country. Selamat Datang ke Creepyness!</p>
