<p>Now that Ruben has his <a title="Entry: MacTheKnife is back in bidness!" href="//rubenerd.com.com/mactheknife-is-back-in-bidness/">MacBook Pro back</a>, he decided to try a new &quot;theme&quot; kinda thing.</p>
<p>While he thought <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/tag/bakemonogatari">Bakemonogatari</a> was an interesting show, what he really did love were the graphics and character designs, and while <em>Sengoku Nadeko</em> wasn&#39;t his favourite spirit-possessed character, the colours in this background were too gorgeous to pass up. As a bonus, they match really well with Terminal.app&#39;s &quot;Red Sands&quot; theme which he&#39;d never used before. They&#39;re all like the colours from Ubuntuâ€¦ only classy!</p>
<p>As a matter of disclosure, Ruben uses <a href="http://www.sabayon.org/">Sabayon</a> and <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a> as his Linux distros of choice, and only talks about himself in the Third Person occasionally. Like a boss.</p>
