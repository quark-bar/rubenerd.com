<p>I&#39;m appalled at the suggestion that the HP Envy is an <a href="http://www.apple.com/sg/macbookpro/">Apple hardware knockoff</a>. For one thing, the optical drive is on the wrong side, and the power button looks entirely different. It also doesn&#39;t run Android, at least not without an emulator.</p>
