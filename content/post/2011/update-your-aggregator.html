<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/icon.feed.64px.png" alt="" style="height:64px; width:64px; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px;" class="transparent" />Every year or so I like to remind people that if they&#39;re still subscribed to my old web feed to please update their blog aggregator:</p>
<p><a style="white-space:nowrap" href="http://rubenerd.com/feed/">rubenerdshow.com/blog/feed/</a> &#8594; <a style="white-space:nowrap" href="http://rubenerd.com/feed/">rubenerd.com/feed/</a>.</p>
<p>In April 2009 I <a href="http://rubenerd.com/we-are-back/">moved domains</a>, and two years and one month later Google Reader is still reporting 45 people are subscribed to the old feed. I appreciate your readership more than perhaps life itself, but if you could do me a favour and resubscribe with the new address, then unsubscribe from the previous one, I&#39;d really appreciate it! Why doesn&#39;t Google do this for us <a href="http://rubenerd.com/reader-feed-update/">automatically</a>?</p>
<p>I&#39;ll still keep it registered, but one of these days I&#39;d love to retire that old domain with all its redirects, and stop paying my webhost to park it for me.</p>
