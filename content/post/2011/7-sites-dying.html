<blockquote><p><a href="http://news.discovery.com/tech/seven-popular-website-dying-110825.html">7 Formerly Popular Sites that Are Dying</a>: Indications are that Slashdot, Blogger, Digg and other sites are on their way out.</p></blockquote>
<p>As too is Discovery&#39;s arithmetic: they listed eight bullet points. I guess it&#39;s to be expected, they&#39;re on the spurious &quot;Twitter killed blogs&quot; bandwagon.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> According to the site, the &quot;content&quot; is &quot;provided&quot; by FoxNews.com. That makes even more sense.</p>
