<p>Never in a million years would I have reckoned I&#39;d go to JBOX to have a literary adventure… in English?</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>Browsing-ishness</h3>
<p>When time permits, I browse the <a href="http://www.jbox.com/">JBOX</a> site not necessarily for the ultimate purchasing of goods, but merely to ascertain if there&#39;s anything cool. Of all the online retailers of Japanese goods, they&#39;re the best mob I&#39;ve dealt with, and <a href="https://twitter.com/jlist">Peter Payne</a> is a really nice guy.</p>
<p>Granted Mio is my least favourite character from the series, but in scrolling through the search results for <a href="http://www.jbox.com/search/all/keion">K-On material</a>, the description for one of her figures caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote><p>Figure maker Alphamax presents this adorable new look at Akiyama Mio from the hit TV anime and manga K-On (Keion). Mio is sporting a blue bikini and looks <strong>diagonally with a coquettish pose</strong> at the viewer [..]</p></blockquote>
<p>My first thought when I read that was… how does one look <em>&quot;diagonally?&quot;</em> Is it a form of observational relativity whereby if I tilt my head I cause your eyes to align diagonally to my plane of vision? Judging from her pose I surmised this had more to do with how she was positioning her head relative to her body, not in her eyes specifically, so I figured this warranted no further attention. See what I did there?</p>

<p>Evidently Mio didn&#39;t!</p>
<p>The second term that struck me was <em>&quot;coquettish&quot;</em>, which given I had yet to sup led me to think of <em>&quot;croque-monsieurs&quot;</em>, those delectable French grilled cheese sandwiches. Ironically the best <em>croque-monsieur</em> I&#39;ve ever had was in Austria. There are large numbers of French speakers in Switzerland, but Austria is overwhelmingly Germanic, though I concede there isn&#39;t necessarily a correlation to one&#39;s tongue and whether one can cook regional cuisine, despite the critical role said organ plays in the consuming of comestibles. If it were true, I&#39;d be exemplary at cooking… German kangaroo in haggis?</p>
<p>Which reminds me, do you recall when I used to refer to <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/grilled-cheese-sandwiches/">grilled cheese sandwiches</a> constantly here?! Such was the extent of my obsession some of your even submitted recipes and suggestions and used them in your comments! I think <a href="http://makinitupasigo.com/blog2/?p=455">Sparx took the cake in 2009</a>… or the sandwich :)</p>

<h3>But I digress-ishness</h3>
<p>Upon consultation, my media university student sister knew of the term, so I just assumed it was another meme I wasn&#39;t cool enough to understand. Using Wiktionary &#8212; <em>The Free Dictionary That Anyone Can Edit</em> &#8212; to uncover the meaning of the term lead me to this definition:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Croque-monsieur"><p>A <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Croque-monsieur">croque-monsieur</a> is a hot ham and cheese (typically emmental or gruyère) grilled sandwich. It originated in France as a fast-food snack served in cafés and bars. </p></blockquote>
<p><em>Emmental</em> is one of my favourite hard French cheeses! Hey wait a minute, not only was that the incorrect term, it was also derived from Wikipedia and <strong>NOT</strong> Wiktionary. Let me just say it for you: Ruben, you&#39;re not being very coquettish.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wiktionary/en/wiki/coquettish"><p><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wiktionary/en/wiki/coquettish">coquettish</a> (comparative more coquettish, superlative most coquettish): As a young, flirting girl.</p></blockquote>
<p>In her capacity as my literary advisor, my sibling claimed that while this definition may have been relevant in the past and spoke to the term&#39;s origins, it was insufficient to describe how the term is used online today. She alleges it refers to a girl who only flirts a little, but cutely.</p>
<p>She also claims the word is used heavily in cheesy romance novels, which makes sense given the word&#39;s startling resemblance to the culinary dish referred to as <em>croque-monsieur</em>.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this whole escapade has left me feeling rather lacking in literary perspicacity. Oh well, it&#39;s always in the last place I look.</p>
<h3>Ende-ishness</h3>
<p>We end with another picture, this time not necessary with much coquettish-ness (I&#39;m still unsure about that term) but with all of them looking happy. Mio has perhaps the most extreme version of the <em>&quot;New KyoAni face&quot;</em> I&#39;ve seen in this one!</p>
<p>It&#39;s so cold in Australia right now &gt;_&lt;.</p>
