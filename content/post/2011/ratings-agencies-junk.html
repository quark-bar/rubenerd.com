<p>Remember my recent post about <a title="Sunday 31st July 2011: Nothing but fantastic Irish economic news!" href="//rubenerd.com/fantastic-irish-economic-news/">Ireland&#39;s economy</a>, and how <a title="Wednesday 06th July 2011: Not paying attention to Moodyâ€™s?" href="//rubenerd.com/portugal-moodys/">I rated as junk</a> the ratings agencies themselves?</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Rob Delaney <a href="http://robdelaney.tumblr.com/post/8540226018/bought-some-us-stocks">said it much better</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>[Ratings agencies] maintained AAA ratings for companies run by abject criminals who knowingly, consciously, and systematically lied to US citizens and citizens of the world at large. Thus, they are culpable in the collapse of many banks (my own included) and their actions, among other things, drove thousands of families from their homes. As such, their opinion is worthless to me and it should be worthless to you.</p></blockquote>
