<p>I know why AOL Tech canned the <a title="Farewell, Internet" href="http://downloadsquad.switched.com/2011/04/12/farewell-internet/">DownloadSquad</a>: <strong>their old logo was cooler</strong>. In all seriousness though, if we needed any further proof that being bought out by AOL is tantamount to EOL, there it is. How long do we give TechCrunch and HuffPo?</p>
<p>It&#39;s just like Cisco&#39;s canning of Flip. Why do these companies buy other companies, then ditch them and their employees? I suppose we have the power of hindsight, but in both these cases it didn&#39;t make sense to me even at the beginning. Oh well, <em>se a vida &eacute;.</em></p>
<p>I read <a href="http://gigaom.com/">GigaOm</a> anyway, and so should you.</p>
