<p>If you&#39;re covering WWDC 2011, I most likely have a nit to pick with you. Apple has not resumed honouring <strong>Mac developers</strong> as you are claiming, they&#39;ve started honouring <strong>Mac App Store developers</strong>. </p>
<p>Don&#39;t worry, even the pros are making this mistake, but there&#39;s a huge difference. I trust this [un]intentional obfuscation on your part will be resolved ;).</p>
