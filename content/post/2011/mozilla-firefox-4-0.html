Like <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/freeed/5551404638/">this cake</a> ;).</p>
<p>I’ve been using the RCs for several weeks, and other than a few stability and tab issues I’ve been enjoying the improved performance and cleaner interface.</p>
<p>I’ve been swamped with work and studies as of late (I still haven’t uploaded my photos from the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/seeing-weird-al-yankovic/">Weird Al</a> concert!) but I hope to have a more detailed review up in the coming days, particularly some of the new extension sandboxing, DNT headers and other goodies. Stay tuned :).</p>
