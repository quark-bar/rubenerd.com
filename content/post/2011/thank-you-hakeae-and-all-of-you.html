<p>I’d like to take this time to thank <strong>Hakeae</strong> for <a href="//rubenerd.com/buy-a-coffee/">buying me a cup of coffee</a> on Monday, but even moreso for the lovely comments, particularly on my dedication page. I’m glad I was able to help, and that you appreciate what I do :)</p>
<p>While I’m on this train of thought, I’d also like to thank the 95 (51+44) of you subscribed to my new and old feeds in Google Reader. I’m humbled that out of the millions of blogs out there, you value mine highly enough to subscribe and read it. Also a ton of thanks to those of you who so regularly share my entries there to promote the site, it’s hugely appreciated!</p>
<p>You guys and girls are all the epitome of awesomeness, in case you didn’t yet realise. Thank you so much :’)</p>
