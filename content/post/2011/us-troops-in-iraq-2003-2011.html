<blockquote><p>The last convoy of U.S. soldiers pulled out of Iraq this morning, crossing into Kuwait and ending the American withdrawal nearly nine years after the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>The military intervention began in March 2003 with missiles striking Baghdad and closes with Iraq a fragile democracy still facing insurgents and sectarian tensions. ~ <a href="http://www.rte.ie/news/2011/1218/iraq.html">RTE News</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I remember sitting having lunch in high school in Singapore when the invasion was announced. Little did we know.</p>
<p>US soldiers may be leaving, but <a href="http://original.antiwar.com/updates/2011/12/12/iraqi-critics-questions-size-of-us-embassy-staff-in-baghdad/">in their place</a> are investment bankers and a whopping 15,000 embassy staff. Make no mistake, the occupation isn&#39;t over.</p>
