<p>I&#39;m late to the party on this, but was going through my spam folder this afternoon and saw an email report on <a href="http://www.astaro.com/blog/sophos-to-acquire-astaro">this announcement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Several months ago Sophos approached Astaro with the idea to bring the two companies together [..] we have now signed a definitive agreement to be acquired by Sophos.</p></blockquote>
<p>I used a beige box with ASG on it for years before switching to a VMware appliance. I wish them the best, though the history of IT mergers, buyouts and takeovers aren&#39;t on their side.</p>
