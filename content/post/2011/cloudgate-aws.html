<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/blog.icon.cloud.90px.png" alt="" style="height:90px; width:128px; float:right;" class="transparent" />Ben Parr on Mashable asking the question: <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/04/22/amazon-cloud-collapse/">What We Can Learn From Amazon’s Cloud Collapse</a>?</p>
<p>Simple. While arguably cheaper, simpler and more accessible from different devices for clients, cloud services aren’t the more reliable, robust replacements for software we were sold. Just like every other complex transaction-based computer system, Google and Amazon’s systems aren’t perfect and suffer outages. Relying upon centralised systems only exacerbates the issue.</p>
<p>If anything, I hope people’s expectations become more realistic after this alleged &quot;cloudgate&quot; These are billion dollar companies, and even they can’t keep their services up. Oh my.</p>
