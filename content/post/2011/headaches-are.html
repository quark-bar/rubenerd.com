<p>Normally I refrain from self-absorbed blog entries, but today marks the three week anniversary of having these recurring headaches. They feel like I&#39;m wearing a tight band around my head, and just as they seem to go away, another one starts in their place. It&#39;s like there&#39;s a sine wave in my head.</p>
<p>While they haven&#39;t impacted my work and studies as much as the migraines I tend to get, suffice to say they&#39;re starting to wear me down. I have a followup visit to the doctor on Monday to see what&#39;s going on; given family history the hypochondriac in me assumes something awful, though I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a reasonable explanation.</p>
<p>Thank you for letting me vent :).</p>
