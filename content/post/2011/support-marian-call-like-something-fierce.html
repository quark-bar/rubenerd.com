<p>For those of you who want to support the web’s nicest, spunkiest, coolest, talented-est (is that a word?!) musician, <a href="https://mariancall.wordpress.com/">Marian Call</a> still has some swag to sell to support her production efforts for her latest album which is Something Fierce! See what I did there, I used the title of the album in the sentence! Huh? HUH!? :D</p>
<p>But I digress! Buy some stuff and leave a generous tip on her <a href="https://mariancall.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/fundraiser-2011-releasing-something-fierce/">Fundraiser 2011: Releasing Something Fierce!</a> page. Can’t wait for her next album, this is going to be <strong>sweet</strong>! Not that I’m biased or anything :).</p>
