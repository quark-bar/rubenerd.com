<p>I make it a habit of going outside to watch sunsets from our suburban bunker here when I can. This evening the whole sky was obscured by cloud, but the light dyed them a really vivid, pretty colour.</p>
<p>I know nothing about professional photography, but it was as if the clouds were acting as a light diffuser. I felt like I was wearing tinted glasses walking around outside, everything was bathed in a pinkish-orange glow. Didn&#39;t last for long, but it was fun :)</p>
