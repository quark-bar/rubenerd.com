<p>Ironic considering I just talked about <a title="Entry: DNS Rambling" href="//rubenerd.com/dns-rambling/">this issue</a> recently, but it seems <a title="Joe Maller" href="http://joemaller.com/2577/itunes-slowdowns-with-google-dns/">several</a> <a title="John Gruber" href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/12/29/itunes-store-dns">folks</a> are having issues with their Apple TVs when using Google Public DNS. I reverted back to my ISPs DNS servers here and have noticed far better performance, even though by some accounts I shouldn&#39;t be. Go figure!</p>
<blockquote><p>Last night we tried to rent an iTunes movie on our newish Apple TV. Instead of starting right away, the Apple TV said it would be 2+ hours before we could start watching. I’ve got a healthy 15-20Mb/s connection and a clean wire to the Apple TV, so this shouldn’t be happening.</p>
<p>A little bit of research turned up a surprising fix: Don’t use Google [Public] DNS.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect a Google TV conspiracy. They want their boxes to look like they perform better than Apple TVs. Yeah, that must be it.</p>
