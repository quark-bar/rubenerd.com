<p>Chuck Norris doesn&#39;t <a href="http://wonkette.com/444199/chuck-norris-plagiarizes-in-his-column-all-the-time" title="Wonkette: Chuck Norris Commits Plagiarism In His Column All the Time">plagiarise</a>, he writes his columns then roundhouse kicks them through subspace into the past for others to publish first. If that isn&#39;t a <a href="//rubenerd.com/chuck-norris-facts/">Chuck Norris Fact</a>, it should be.</p>
<p>As a matter of disclosure, the enclosed image is of Bruce Schneier&#39;s head superimposed on Chuck Norris, for my <a href="//rubenerd.com/bruce-schneier/">Bruce Schneier Facts post</a> from 2006. One of the Bruce Schneier facts you may not be aware of: Bruce Schneier fully discloses his own vulnerabilities: <em>none</em>.</p>
