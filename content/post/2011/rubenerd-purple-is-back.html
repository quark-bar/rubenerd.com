<p>For those of you lucky enough to not have to ever see my horrible blog design give read the <a href="//rubenerd.com/feed/">RSS feed</a> (or <a href="//rubenerd.com/feed/rdf/">RDF</a>… really?), you may not have noticed the sudden change to purple a few days ago! Purpleness!</p>
<p>I&#39;ll admit it, purple has secretly been my favourite colour since I got my hands on some Sun hardware when I was a kid, though in primary school I was informed by a well meaning teacher that perhaps I shouldn&#39;t make that fact well known for its… shall we say, social implications. Now I&#39;m older and simply don&#39;t care what people think about my appearance or tastes, so I figure if Andrew Cox can <a href="//rubenerd.com/strusta-lake-desktop/#comments">admit to it</a> being his favourite colour, I can too!</p>
<p>I&#39;m still working on getting the schade (sorry, bad pun) right, but for the time being let me know what you think :). <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/yumekui-merry/">Merry Nightmare</a>, <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/bakemonogatari/">Senjoughara Hitagi</a> and Hotaru/Sailor Saturn would approve!</p>
