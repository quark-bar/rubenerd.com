<p>Admittedly these version updates were bigger news before Mozilla got Chrome envy, but still <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/download.html?product=firefox-7.0">Firefox just got updated to 7.0</a>. I just downloaded it for my Macs, and I&#39;m sure the tireless maintainers of the FreeBSD Ports system and Fedora repositories are hard at work at adding it.</p>
<p>I&#39;d already been using the 7.0 nightly builds given I was one of the unlucky few bitten by the <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/questions/874804">severe memory leaks</a> and CPU hogging with 6.0.2, as you can see in the screenshot above. </p>
