<blockquote cite="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/05/19/big-mac"><p>Dan Gorske has eaten 25,000 Big Macs over 39 years — close to two per day, every day. My first thought when I heard about him was that he must be either an idiot or an asshole. But now I think not. I think maybe he’s a lucky man — someone who found the perfect food to suit his taste, an obsessive who never tires of it, and it happens to be cheap and readily available almost everywhere in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s a lucky man because he&#39;s still alive.</p>
