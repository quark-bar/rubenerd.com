<blockquote><p>In the past few years, the global count of supercentenarians—people 110 and older—has leveled off at about 80. And the maximum age hasn’t budged. Robert Young, senior gerontology consultant for the Guinness Book of World Records, says, &#8220;The more people are turning 110, the more people are dying at 110.&#8221;</p>
