<p>When I came across the above graphic on <a href="http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=17468096">Pixiv</a> and chuckled to myself in the same way I chuckled about the <a title="Tuesday 10th May 2011: Bakemonogtari Magica!" href="//rubenerd.com/anime-bakemonogtari-magica/">Bakemonogatari crossover</a>, I had no idea that <strong>Asusa as Madoka</strong> was a meme! I&#39;m a lousy okaku ;)</p>

<p>From <a href="https://jakesanimeblog.wordpress.com/2011/03/08/k-on-fanzine-magica-mahou-shoujo-azusa/">Jake&#39;s Anime Blog</a> from all the way back in March 2011:</p>
<blockquote><p>A K-ON!! fanzine has appeared in Akihabara with Nakano Azusa from the anime/manga franchise K-ON! in a role from the anime series Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica</p></blockquote>
<p>And the accompanying photo:</p>

<p>I have to say I&#39;m without a doubt a Mugi fanboy with Yui a close second, but Azusa is terribly cute and fits the roll well, at least from what I&#39;ve seen so far.</p>
<p>Now I just need to actually <strong>finish</strong> Madoka Magica, lest someone get angry that I&#39;m posting about a series I haven&#39;t watched all the way through yet! I cop enough flack for having figures and wall scrolls for unfinished shows. There just aren&#39;t enough hours in the day!</p>
