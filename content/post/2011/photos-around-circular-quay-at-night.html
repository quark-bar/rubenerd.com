<p>After giving a talk at uni this evening, I took the train a couple of stops to Circular Quay and just wandered around for a while. Whipping out my cameraphone to take a picture of a very colourful paddlewheel boat thingy, I just felt the urge to keep taking grainy, awful photos! It was fun though :)</p>

<h3>Wandering around</h3>
<p>The Rocks area is really pretty at night, kinda like wandering around Marina Bay in Singapore at night only with way more music and a bit more chewing gum on the footpath ;).</p>

<h3>Grabbing an evening snack</h3>
<p>Yes, Starbucks. I happen to like them. If you don’t, that’s great, exercise your free will and let others do the same :). They even gave me a free cranberry and vanilla muffin, and it was super tasty!</p>

<h3>Catching the train home</h3>
<p>In the late evenings CityRail usually only operates trains every fifteen minutes or so to the places you want to go, but fortunately by sheer chance I stepped onto the platform almost as soon as the train was due. Surprisingly, it was on time too!</p>
<p>I really do miss Singapore a great deal and hope to return there, but this birth country of mine is slowly growing on me again :)</p>
