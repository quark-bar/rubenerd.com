<p>All you need to know. Or you can read my vented frustrations!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>Comprehensive broken keyboard insurance!</h3>
<p>This Victorian number (03 9945 7300 in local Aussie number reference) has called my handphone once or twice a day for just shy of a month now. Granted they&#39;re more considerate than other marketers, at least they don&#39;t call during dinner or in the wee hours of the morning like I used to get on my old Aussie number. It&#39;s still unwanted though!</p>
<p>Doing a quick Google search returned <a href="http://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-039-945-7300">these results</a>. When I read the number is allegedly from telemarketers working for Insurance Line, I wasn&#39;t surprised. The bane of morning TV with their painfully scripted &quot;infomercials&quot; I&#39;ve had to sit through while in offices or caf&eacute;s that play TV, Insurance Line are the exploiters of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.insuranceline.com.au/AboutInsuranceLine.aspx">more individual fears</a> that I&#39;ve ever seen from an insurer. <em>Cancer insurance?</em> <em>contains rage</em>.</p>
<p>Needless to say, their insidious telemarketing will insure (see what I did there?) that even if I were considering them for insurance before, I wouldn&#39;t now. I suppose companies that indulge in this behaviour can justify it financially otherwise they wouldn&#39;t do it, but next time they call, I&#39;ll answer in silence. If they want to call me, they can waste their money.</p>

<h3>The Trace is The Race</h3>
<p>Aside from the frustration this number is causing me, what I&#39;d like to know is how they got my number in the first place. The only organisations I [knowingly] gave my number to are DBS/POSB, NUS and SingTel in Singapore, and Westpac and UTS in Australia. I&#39;ve never entered &quot;contests&quot; (aka: marketing gathering exercises) nor have I ever called a &quot;premium&quot; number with it. I&#39;m on the Australian Do Not Call list. The Bird is The Word.</p>
<p>I tell you what, I love my iTelephone, but a webOS or Android phone with third party software to block certain numbers sounds awfully appealing right now. Optus won&#39;t let me block numbers.</p>
