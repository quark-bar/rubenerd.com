People who don&#39;t encrypt their personal files before sending them off to a public, shared server clearly want their data to be read in the clear, so who cares?</p>
<p>Yes, I&#39;m being a little tongue in cheek ;). While I lament the fact some people are so blas&eacute; and loose with their data, the fact Dropbox doesn&#39;t automatically encrypt files for their users is a bit worrying. We&#39;ve also known for a couple of weeks that allegedly their <a href="http://dereknewton.com/2011/04/dropbox-authentication-static-host-ids/">login system</a> leaves a lot to be desired, but then again if you personally encrypted your data before uploading, you&#39;d be fine anyway.</p>
<p>All cloud services have potential, you just have to be smart in the way you use them and recognise their weaknesses.</p>
