<p>So you&#39;ve set up <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/">NetworkManager</a> on your <a href="http://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> laptop to easily use wireless networks, but it doesn&#39;t appear in your desktop environment&#39;s notification tray, nor do the networks themselves work. You&#39;ve probably just been dumb like me ;).</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>First, to made sure it&#39;s not NetworkManager itself that&#39;s faulty, attempt to run it as root, including the camelCase.</p>
<blockquote style="font-family:monospace;"><p>
# NetworkManager
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you get a notification that it loaded successfully, chances are you loaded it in the <code>DAEMONS</code> line <strong>before</strong> <code>dbus</code> in <code>/etc/rc.conf</code>, as I stupidly did! Make sure they&#39;re in the right order:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family:monospace;"><p>
DAEMONS=([..] dbus networkmanager birdisword [..])
</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, some Arch installations I&#39;ve used haven&#39;t needed this, but sometimes its worth adding <code>dbus-launch</code> to your <code>exec</code> line in <code>~/.xinitrc</code>, presuming you start X by typing <code>startx</code> because you have as little patience for GDM, SLiM and its ilk as I do. This also has the effect of silencing some permission issues with memory keys.</p>
<blockquote style="font-family:monospace;"><p>
exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch startxfce4
</p></blockquote>
