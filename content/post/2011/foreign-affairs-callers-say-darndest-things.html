<p><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/12/28/canada-consular-services.html">From the CBC</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>So while embassy officials can provide you with list of lawyers and information on local laws, they cannot arrange a helicopter to rescue your son from a German prison yard after he was arrested on drug charges, as one family requested.</p></blockquote>
<p>A friend of mine who&#39;s father worked at the <a href="http://www.australia.org.sg/">Australian High Commission in Singapore</a> told me a common question was which stores carried Vegemite. People actually called the High Commission to find that out!</p>
