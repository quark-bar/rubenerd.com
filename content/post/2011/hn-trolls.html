<p>In other news, the reason why their site looks crap on *nix is due to their use of Verdana in their <abbr title="cascading style sheets">CSS</abbr> with no fallbacks, not even the standardised <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/fonts.html#sans-serif-def">sans-serif</a> identifier. Perhaps their web designer is a hipster, and knowing their target market did it ironically.</p>
