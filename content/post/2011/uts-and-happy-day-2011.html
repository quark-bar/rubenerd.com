<p>Speaking of good news, I just got my acceptance letter from the <a href="http://www.uac.edu.au/">UAC</a> for my followup degree at <a href="http://www.it.uts.edu.au/courses/postgraduate/index.html">UTS</a>!</p>
<p>After studying briefly at another institution (which we won&#39;t bring up in polite conversation!) and repeatedly putting everything on hold for extenuating family circumstances, the staff at UTS have been nothing but supportive. My application was complex, but they put it through, and I&#39;m just so overjoyed!</p>
<p>UTS, my Michael Franks CDs arrived (a post for tomorrow!), I got a coffee from Hakeae, this will be dubbed Happy Day 2011 :)</p>
