<p>When I want to comment on news stories but they&#39;re not worth dedicating an entire post to, I&#39;ll be collating them into a nonsensically titled Rubenerd News Network post! Today we have <strong>Brazilian cable cars, huge baby bonuses, and IT spending</strong>.</p>

<h3>Cable cars over Rio’s Favelas</h3>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/icon.tango.train.92px.png" alt="" style="height:92px; width:92px; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" class="transparent" /></p>
<blockquote><p><a title="Rio de Janeiro’s Transit Solution: Cable Cars Over the Favelas" href="http://www.wired.com/magazine/2011/02/st_riogondola/">Wired 2011.11.28:</a> There’s nowhere for public transit to go [in the slums of Rio de Janeiro]. Nowhere, that is, but up. </p>
<p>The government says that 152 gondolas will carry 30,000 people a day along a 2.1-mile route over the neighborhood, transforming the hour-and-a-half trudge to a nearby commuter rail station into a 16-minute sky ride.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Wired article also explains the real impetus for construction: the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics aren&#39;t all that far away. I suppose its more realistic to expect this than money being used to actually help people living in poverty stricken neighbourhoods.</p>
<h3>Quick poll on Channel NewsAsia</h3>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/">Channel NewsAsia 2011.03.07:</a> A straw poll showed more women will be convinced to have a child if given a baby-bonus carrot of $500,000 per child, said an MP. Should Singapore adopt the idea?</p></blockquote>
<p>So far 45% voted yes, 22% said it&#39;d be too expensive, and 33% said money can&#39;t solve Singapore&#39;s fertility problem. I&#39;d put myself in the latter; if I were a woman I&#39;d want societal concerns addressed rather than just being told I can be bought off. I&#39;d also worry about pushy husbands demanding their wives have kids for cash, that&#39;s a bit icky.</p>
<h3>IT spending up in 2010</h3>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/icon.tango.dollar.92px.png" alt="" style="height:92px; width:92px; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" class="transparent" /></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2011/03/06/idc_it_spending_2010_2011/" title="IT spending higher than expected in 2010">Channel Register 2011.03.06:</a> The IT sector turned in its best growth since 2007, according to the analysts at IDC. That&#39;s good news, and the news kept getting better as 2010 went on. Maybe 2011 won&#39;t be so bad if the world settles down a little politically.</p></blockquote>
<p>I disagree. When people are nervous, governments hand out more lucrative defence contracts, and enterprise IT companies are there to eat the pork. <em>&quot;We&#39;ve always been at war with <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Nations_of_Nineteen_Eighty-Four">Eastasia</a>.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Not sure whether I&#39;ll keep doing these news posts, but fun for an experiment :).</p>
