<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/12/04/marco-ereaders">John Gruber</a>, on <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/12/02/kindle-touch-vs-nook-simple-touch-kobo-touch-kindle-4">Marco Arment&#39;s</a> Kindle comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>His surprising (to me, at least) conclusion: &quot;The low-end, non-touch Kindle 4 is actually my favorite e-reader today.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve used my old man&#39;s iPad to read books, and I&#39;ve read books on my iPhone and my computers. The lowest end Kindle can&#39;t do everything an iPad can (or the Kindle Fire, or those <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/11/fun_with_numbers">other tablets</a>), but it has the single best form factor, controls, weight and display for long form reading. It&#39;s as simple as that.</p>
