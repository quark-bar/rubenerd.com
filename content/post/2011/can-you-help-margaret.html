<p>When I wrote a post in 2006 about the <a title="Entry: The Hinton Train Disaster" href="//rubenerd.com/the-hinton-train-disaster/">Hinton Train Disaster</a> and a <a href="//rubenerd.com/the-hinton-train-disaster-revisited/">followup post</a> in 2007, I never expected them to be some of my most commented on and read entries, let alone appearing <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=hinton+train+disaster">#3</a> in Google for the search term. This <a href="//rubenerd.com/the-hinton-train-disaster/#comment-2522">latest comment</a> was left by Margaret, a student at Carelton University in Ottawa:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m writing an article on the Hinton Train Disaster and would love to speak with anyone who can provide me with information and insight into their own experience. If you can help, please send me an email at <strong>omrshll[AT]gmail[DOT]com</strong>. Thank you very much in advance!</p></blockquote>
<p>Republishing her comment here if you can help her out. Much appreciated ^__^</p>
