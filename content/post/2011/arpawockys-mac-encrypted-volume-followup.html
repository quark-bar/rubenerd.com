This afternoon, Arpawocky wrote a brilliant followup with his own recommendations and experience, and even donated a cup of coffee!</p>
<p>I&#39;m sending my humble thank yous to Arpawocky, and encouraging you to read the <a href="//rubenerd.com/mac-encrypted-disk-images/#comments">comments section</a> of the aformentioned post if you&#39;re serious about using Disk Utility encrypted volumes on Mac OS X with good passphrases.</p>
