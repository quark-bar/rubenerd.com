<p>In hindsight I should have used ISO 800 instead of 1600 and one of my faster lenses, but given I finally have a <a title="Tuesday 21st June 2011: A cheap solution for my Nikon D60 battery?" href="//rubenerd.com/nikon-d60-cameragrip/">working battery</a> on my D60 now, on a whim I headed down to the park adjacent to Sydney Airport and just shot some stuff. I could have phrased that better, particularly given you&#39;re not supposed to make jokes about airport security near airports.</p>
<p>Enjoy :)</p>
