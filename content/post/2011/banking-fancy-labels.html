<blockquote cite="http://beyond-school.tumblr.com/post/2578215810/the-age-of-american-predominance-is-over-our"><p>Our leading bankers looted the state, plunged the world into deep recession, and cost us 8 million jobs. And now many of them stand by with sharpened knives and enhanced bonuses â€“ also most willing to suggest how the salaries and jobs of others can be further cut. Think about the morality of that one.</p></blockquote>
<p>No doubt on my mind, my American friends were robbed blind. And its happening around the world. I suppose they suspect the middle class are still too preoccupied fighting amongst themselves over who&#39;s a conservative or a progressive or any other convenient label to put up a fight against the real enemies here. And they&#39;re right.</p>
<p>Heck, I&#39;ve got into enough trouble just saying I&#39;m an atheist humanist greenie liberal with libertarian leanings. That&#39;s a lot of words.</p>
