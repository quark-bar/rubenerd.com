<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/enlightenment_logo_gold.png" alt="" style="height:240px; width:181px; float:right;" class="transparent" />Be still my beating heart. <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/p.php?p=news/show&#038;l=en&amp;news_id=28">Enlightenment E17 is at 1.0</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>Finally after a long time coming, we are pleased to announce the 1.0 release of the core [Enlightenment Foundation Libraries] (With the exception of Eet at 1.4).</p></blockquote>
<p>In my opinion, Enlightenment is the most beautiful window manager for *nix systems, hands down. Long before Compiz and KDE4, Enlightenment squeezed out some pretty darn impressive graphics out of modest hardware.</p>
<p>In the bad old days, I moved from it to Xfce purely because I used mostly GTK+ apps and wanted visual consistency. Always had a soft spot for Enlightenment though, think it&#39;ll be getting an install again :).</p>
