<p>Back when I used to watch lots of Microsoft keynotes, I always noticed how awkwardly Steve Ballmer held his arms; at times it made him look practically ghoulish! Judging from <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/19/microsoft-rebuts-intels-claims-about-windows-8-calls-them-fac/">this photo from Engadget</a>, he&#39;s still doing it.</p>
<p>We can&#39;t all be Jobs or Ellison when delivering sales pitches; heck I twitch and flail my limbs all over the place when speaking! Still, as the CEO of a company trying to shed its evil overlord image, perhaps he could stand to gain from some lessons!</p>
<p><strong>I… love… this… company! Developers developers developers developers!</strong> Sorry, it had to be said.</p>
