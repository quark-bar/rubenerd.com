<p>Ruben… the FreeBSD guy? Yes!</p>

<blockquote><p>Just thought I would take a moment to remind Fedora folks that <strong>even people outside of our project are rooting for us.</strong> We are going through growing pains, and quite possibly an identity crisis. This is normal, things improve. Take a breather folks; relax a bit (I promise you – that will really help things quite a bit.)</p>
<p>We have the Four Pillars to help here, as well as the beautiful simplicity of *Be Excellent* to each other. Folks in other parts of the FOSS universe could not help but overhear some of the debates currently happening. We do so much for Linux/FOSS in general- that our health is very important. Most can see this.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m still at heart a FreeBSD and Mac user, but when I deploy Linux I deploy Fedora, just as I did Red Hat Linux back in the day. Its well maintained, has an enthusiastic developer and support community, RPMs for a ridiculous amount of software are readily available, and the releases are reliably scheduled and polished.</p>
<p>Fedora&#39;s improvements have a trickle down effect and benefit us all. For example, on my FreeBSD machines I run much of the same software, plus I benefit from the push towards open drivers and upstream improvements to desktop environment usability and software security patches.</p>
<p>I’ve been following several of the issues in the Fedora community on their mailing lists, not least the skirmish regarding the UI future of Gnome 3 which I&#39;ve commented on. Ultimately I hope these issues are resolved and everyone grows stronger from the shared experience. One of the strengths of the free and open source software movement is democracy.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t even poke fun at the fact that rooting in Australia means something else entirely.</p>
