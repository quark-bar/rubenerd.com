<blockquote><p>Google recently released Google+, a new social network. Do you think you need another social network? <cite>~ <a href="https://dailypost.wordpress.com/2011/06/30/do-you-need-another-social-network/">The Daily Post</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<p>You mean, another <em>Google</em> social network, or another social network in general? I&#39;ve had revolutionary Orkut, Knol, Jaiku, <a href="//rubenerd.com/goodbye-google-wave/">Wave</a> and Buzz accounts that went nowhere, so it&#39;s hard to muster enthusiasm for yet another of <a title="Thursday 05th August 2010: Google canâ€™t internalise empathy" href="//rubenerd.com/google-cant-internalise-empathy/">this company&#39;s efforts</a>. If it gains some traction I&#39;ll look into it further.</p>
<p>One thing&#39;s for sure, Facebook sorely needs some competition. I&#39;m uneasy about trusting Google with my personal information (<a href="//rubenerd.com/subpoenas-cloud-computing/">not necessarily their fault</a>), but I trust them far more than Facebook. Then again, I&#39;d trust Diaspora more.</p>
<p>As for the name, it&#39;s <em>almost</em> as lame as Apple&#39;s Ping, but not as bad as Qrocity!</p>
