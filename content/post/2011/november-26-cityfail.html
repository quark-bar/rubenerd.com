<p>Trackwork across almost all lines <strong>and</strong> a derailment! Our tax dollars at work.</p>
<p>Makes me think there&#39;s more to this than trackwork. Perhaps there&#39;s a more serious issue, like a malfunctioning control system. One would think the CityRail folks wouldn&#39;t be short sighted enough to have effectively scheduled trackwork across the entire network at the same time.</p>
