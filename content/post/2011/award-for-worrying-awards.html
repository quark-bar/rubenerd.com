<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but the category of &quot;most improved airline&quot; doesn&#39;t instil much confidence! Photo is from the <a href="/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/home/">Jakarta Globe</a>. They&#39;re also on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/thejakartaglobe">@thejakartaglobe</a>.</p>
<p>I might just be jittery given the only time I flew Garuda part of the plane&#39;s landing gear failed on the tarmac. I was only 2, but my parents long since told me about it and how many people around them were injured. I guess, they have <em>improved!</em></p>
