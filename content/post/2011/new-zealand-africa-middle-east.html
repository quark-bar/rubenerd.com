<p>Revolutions, unrest and violence in Northern Africa and the Middle East, and now news of a huge earthquake and not one but nine aftershocks in Christchurch before they&#39;ve even had enough time to recover from their last quake. Jeepers.</p>

<p>Also helps to put our own problems into perspective, doesn&#39;t it?</p>
