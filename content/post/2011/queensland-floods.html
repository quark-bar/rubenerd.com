<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Sending my thoughts out to the victims of the Queensland floods as they continue their march through Brisbane now. I lived there for a couple of years in the mid 1990s growing up, and seeing the photos people are sending in on Twitter with the <a href="https://twitter.com/#search?q=%23qldfloods">#qldfloods</a> hashtag of the flood waters over South Bank and the Riverwalk… its pretty scary :O. Hope you&#39;re all keeping safe, or as best as you can.</p>

<p>I&#39;d advise putting your donations through Bing Lee stores, they&#39;re using the tragedy to get people to like their pages on Facebook. Does that count as looting?</p>
