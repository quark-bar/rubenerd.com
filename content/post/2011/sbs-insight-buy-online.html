<p>Are you a fan of <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/insight/">SBS Insight</a> in Australia? Their Big Sell episode on internet shopping just went to air, and they&#39;re asking for your input into what <a href="http://news.sbs.com.au/insight/article/index/id/557328/h/Poll">you&#39;ve bought online</a>.</p>
<p>I checked &quot;electronic goods&quot;, &quot;books&quot;, &quot;music&quot; and &quot;other&quot;. Was surprised &quot;services&quot; wasn&#39;t an option.</p>
<p>For those in Singapore, I&#39;m not referring to the <a href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/">transport company</a>.</p>
