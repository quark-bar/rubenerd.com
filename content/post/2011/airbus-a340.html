<p>Not the sharpest <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smirne76/4917769416/">Creative Commons licenced photo</a> I could find, but the juxtaposition (I really hate that word) of those typically German buildings with the jet was too good to pass up!</p>

<h3>If itâ€™s on the Internet, it has to be true</h3>
<p>Straight from the <a title="Wikipedia article: Airbus A340" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/A340">Book of Knowledge</a>, having seen it <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/search/a340">trend on Twitter</a> an hour ago.</p>
<blockquote cite="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/A340"><p>Airbus announced on November 10, 2011, that the A340 program was terminated.</p></blockquote>
<p>With the stubbornly high cost of fuel of late, I&#39;m surprised the A340 wasn&#39;t cancelled earlier. The more economical, sleek twin engined Boeing 777 (and to a far lesser extent the A330) has been eating the A340&#39;s lunch for a long time now.</p>
<h3>It was a friggen long aeroplane</h3>
<p>Despite having flown a lot, as far as I can remember I&#39;ve only been on an A340 once, on a Lufthansa trip to Germany. Lufthansa to Germany, really? Who would have thunk it! It had four engines, but it didn&#39;t seem much noisier than other planes I&#39;d flown on.</p>
<p>The thing that struck me when I used to observe planes at the public Changi observation area (I was an exciting teenager!) was just how <strong>long</strong> the A340 was; photos don&#39;t do it justice. Until recently, the later generation A340s were the longest civilian aircraft in the world, longer even than the venerable Boeing 747 that even non-aviation nuts can recognise.</p>
<p>Obviously Airbus is banking (sorry, bad pun) on the new double-decker A380 for its high capacity routes. What I&#39;ll be interested in is how they&#39;ll compete with Boeing on the long distance routes. As far as I can tell, the proposed A350 is more to compete with the Boeing 787 for ultra efficient medium-capacity travel. Will the A330 be getting an overhaul?</p>
