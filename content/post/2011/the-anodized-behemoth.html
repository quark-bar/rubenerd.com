<p>Whenever I install a new hard drive, pointless ritual dictates I must give it a new custom icon. Not being artistically inclined (as evidenced by the site you&#39;re viewing), I often lend myself the use of the fruits of other artists&#39; labours. That was an entirely pointless sentence, as was this one. You know what, forget this whole blasted paragraph. It never happened.</p>
<p>On the left is the default Mac Pro icon in OS X, the right was drawn by Parthiban Mohanraj entitled <a href="http://kamikaze00x.deviantart.com/art/The-Anodized-Behemoth-94138415">The Anodized Behemoth</a> over at DeviantArt. Apple should hire him for all the icons in 10.7 Lion. Given their less than attractive <a href="https://twitter.com/itunes10icon/status/22890145371">new iTunes icon</a>, they desperately need him.</p>
