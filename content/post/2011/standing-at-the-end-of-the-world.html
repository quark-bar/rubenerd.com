<p><a title="Photo of the Australian landscape just outside Bathurst" href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/photo.me.20110224.01.jpg"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/photo.me.20110224.01.thumb.jpg" alt="Photo of the Australian landscape just outside Bathurst" style="height:335px; width:500px; display:inline;" /></a></p>
<p>Just got back from a <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/dubbo-trip-2011/">short trip</a> to the Taronga Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo, about 408 kilometres inland from Sydney. I&#39;ll post some of the billions of photos I took tomorrow.</p>
<p>To tide you over until then, this unedited photo was taken just outside Bathurst on the highest hill we could find. There wasn&#39;t a trace of civilisation to be seen anywhere save for the road itself and a few telegraph poles. The landscape and colour of the sky was just incredible, and… there wasn&#39;t a sound. No kidding, it felt like we were standing at the end of the world.</p>
<p>I like that shade of blue… not that you would have noticed ;).</p>
