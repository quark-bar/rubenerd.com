<p>Allegedly it <a href="//rubenerd.com/hot-enough-for-you-sydney/">wasn&#39;t hot enough for us in Sydney</a>! It was another scorcher today, it felt like stepping into a warming oven as I opened the front door. And to make matters worse, our central air conditioning died! As I type this, myself and our two little white fluffy animals that the vets assure as are dogs are camped out in my home office computer room thingy with a portable air conditioner set to stun. Marge, can you set the oven to <a title="Wikipedia article on The Simpsons epsiode 1 from season 6" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Bart_of_Darkness">cold</a>?</p>
<p>What I was most peeved about though was earlier today the temperature hit <strong>42 degrees Celsius</strong> (<strong>107.6 Fahrenheit</strong>), which from a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7283155.stm">DON&#39;T PANIC</a> perspective would have made a brilliant screenshot, and 107.6 sounds like a trippy radio station. Just saying.</p>
