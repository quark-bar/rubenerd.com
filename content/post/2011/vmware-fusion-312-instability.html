<p>Want to regularly emulate a guaranteed system crash or even a BSoD? Install VMware Fusion 3.1.2 build 332101 and follow me!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<h3>Windows 95</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a new VM and install any version of Windows 95</li>
<li>Select Install VMware Tools from the Virtual Machine menu</li>
<li>Wait for the VMware Tools CD to automount and autostart</li>
<li>Budda boom! Kernel crash!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Windows NT</h3>
<p style="font-style:italic;"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This issue has since been resolved in version 3.1.3, as I <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/vmware-fusion-313-winnt-4/" title="Friday 01 July 2011: VMware Fusion 3.1.3 and Windows NT 4.0">talked about here</a>!</p>
<p>A simple crash dialogue box like that not enough? Well how about a fully blown kernel panic blue screen of death!</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new VM and install any version of Windows NT 4.0 and either the high or regular encryption version of SP6.</li>
<li>Select Install VMware Tools from the Virtual Machine menu</li>
<li>Install any combination of the available VMware Tools youâ€™d like</li>
<li>Reboot, enjoy the show!</li>
</ol>

<p>As I <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/just-bought-vmware-fusion/">blogged about in 2007</a>, I&#39;ve been a paid VMware Fusion user since Version 1 and have bought all the upgrades. Glad to see these new features being introduced :).</p>
<p>Seriously though, it sucks that I have to have VirtualBox on my Macs to run OSs that a product from a premier company like VMware should be able to handle, but lately can&#39;t. Tested the same configuration on my Mac Pro, my MacBook Pro and my sister&#39;s MacBook with the same results. Oh well.</p>
