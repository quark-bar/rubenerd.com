<blockquote><p>Laugh all you want, but as of the end of September, AOL still had 3.5 million subscribers to its dialup Internet access service […] And the decline from last year — about 630,000 subs — was AOL’s smallest Q3 shrinkage yet. ~ <cite><a href="http://www.splatf.com/2011/11/aol-dialup-charts/">SplatF</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not laughing, I&#39;m more interested in seeing how many of these people are still maintaining their accounts specifically for their email addresses. We kept our Pacific Internet account for years after we moved to SingTel Magix and SCV/StarHub specifically for this reason. With their dwindling profits and market share, maybe a premium email forwarding service might be a new source of revenue for them ;).</p>
