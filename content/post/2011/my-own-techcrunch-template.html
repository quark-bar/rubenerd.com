<blockquote><p>Dear TechCrunch Readers,</p>
<p>Our site has a new design. Rather than deferring all questions and comments to the designers themselves, I decided to patronise my readers who’s advertising viewership pays my salary because:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[ &nbsp; ]</span>&nbsp; I’m not a fan either but I’ll mock you for thinking the same<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">[ &nbsp; ]</span>&nbsp; It’s not as bad as Gawker!<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">[ &nbsp; ]</span>&nbsp; Because its &#8220;too early to tell&#8221; that design elements are misplaced</p>
<p>I assert only professional designers are fit to critique designs because:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[ &nbsp; ]</span>&nbsp; Designers are the only people who consume our content<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">[ &nbsp; ]</span>&nbsp; As a journalist I only critique other journalism</p>
<p>I believe these mock forms are still funny because :</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[ &nbsp; ]</span>&nbsp; They’ve never been done before<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">[ &nbsp; ]</span>&nbsp; They haven’t been done enough<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">[ &nbsp; ]</span>&nbsp; I’m being ironic lol!</p>
<p>The new site design is fantastic. And if you don’t like it you can:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">[ &nbsp; ]</span>&nbsp; <del>leave a comment</del> leave a comment if you’re on Facebook<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold;">[ &nbsp; ]</span>&nbsp; go to <a href="http://tcfast.com/?t=ot">http://tcfast.com/</a> which doesn’t support us
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;m off to read <a href="http://gigaom.com/">GigaOM</a> :).</p>
