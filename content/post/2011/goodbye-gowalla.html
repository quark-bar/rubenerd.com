<p>Gowalla have removed the one feature I enjoyed the most with their latest iteration, so it&#39;s time for me to <a href="https://gowalla.com/users/rubenerd">give up my account</a> of many years, and move <a href="https://foursquare.com/rubenerd">exclusively to Foursquare</a>. We had some great times!</p>

<h3>Easter egg hunts for adults</h3>
<p>Like most of my Twitter friends, several years ago I moved from Brightkite to Gowalla to satisfy my check-in obsession. Gowalla was more reliable, and offered some great new features such as badges you would earn for various activities, and beautiful unique graphics for different location categories.</p>
<p>The most interesting twist Gowalla introduced though was the concept of items tied to locations. Like a scavenger hunt, you would find items upon checking into places which you could keep, swap with other items people had left in different places, or use them to &quot;found&quot; places.</p>
<p>While I started using Foursquare last year and concurrently checking into places with it given my friends all use the service, I was an obsessive Gowalla user until this afternoon. I used it to check into my favourite coffee shops in Adelaide at the time, then Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Sydney where I found myself living, then and around Germany, the Czech Republic, France and Ireland on our last holiday. <a href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.gowalla.pinsplaces.jpg">It was lots of fun</a>!</p>

<h3>Uh oh, spaghettioes</h3>
<p>This all seems to have changed however. With their latest software update, Gowalla has introduced their new Guides feature which promises a curated tour of various different cities. To their credit, their graphics are just as great as ever.</p>
<p>Gone however are our earned items and badges. They&#39;re not anywhere in the new application, and API calls return nothing. Call me old fashioned or inexperienced when it comes to cloud computing, but I tend not to trust services that delete our data, particularly data that we&#39;ve collected in world travels and such. I&#39;m also reluctant to contribute material to sites that will delete my data, this has happened far too many times already and I&#39;m tired of it. Is it any wonder I blog on my own domain and web server?</p>
<p>I&#39;ll admit, it was starting to get irritating checking into both Gowalla and Foursquare at the same time<sup>[1]</sup>, and I was starting to look for an excuse to ditch one of them. This change in focus with Gowalla has provided the impetus I needed to move to Foursquare exclusively, which I&#39;ve <a href="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd/status/117144500773732352">now just done</a>. My last Gowalla check-in was at the <a href="http://gowalla.com/spots/2388288">Euro Coffee Bar</a>, the location that surpassed the <a href="http://gowalla.com/spots/52207">Boatdeck Caf&eacute;</a> in Mawson Lakes, Adelaide as my #1 check-in location. Seemed fitting.</p>

<h3>So long, and thanks for all the fish [items].</h3>
<p>Good luck with your new focus Gowalla team, thanks for the fun times. For those of you who have followed me on Gowalla, you can now <a href="https://foursquare.com/rubenerd">find me on Foursquare</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Despite the API not returning anything, I downgraded the app back to 3.3.0 on my iTelephone, and my pins and items were still there. Perhaps they&#39;ve just closed access to them, or stored them on my phone. In that case, may it still be possible to export my stuff then?</p>
