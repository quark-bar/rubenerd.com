<p>Andy’s Answers: <a href="http://smartblogs.com/socialmedia/2011/12/06/andys-answers-how-microsoft-is-influencing-the-influencers/">How Microsoft is influencing the influencers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Microsoft is carefully constructing a network of credible, motivated digital evangelists to spread the word about its products, says communities director Nestor Portillo. That’s allowing the company to scale up its outreach, and to build relationships with customers around the world. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Technology may have created new ways to engage audiences but industry players say success boils down to something tried-and-tested &#8211; a good, engaging storyline.</p></blockquote>
