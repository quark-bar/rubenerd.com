<p>What a month. We had HP <a title="Saturday 20th August 2011: An ode to HP desktops and PDAs" href="//rubenerd.com/ode-to-hp/">retiring</a> their PC and Palm hardware divisions, Michael Dell being <a href="//rubenerd.com/dell-goodbye-hp/" title="Monday 22nd August 2011: Foresight versus hindsight at Dell">smug</a> about it, Steve Jobs <a title="Thursday 25th August 2011: Goodbye Steve" href="//rubenerd.com/goodbye-steve/">retiring</a> as CEO of Apple, a <a title="Friday 26th August 2011: We donâ€™t need fibre optic and power cables!" href="//rubenerd.com/australia-nbn/">tutor</a> from my technology uni saying broadband in Australia is fast enough, and now we learn that <a href="http://cmdrtaco.net/">CmdrTaco</a> is <a title="Rob 'CmdrTaco' Malda Resigns From Slashdot" href="http://meta.slashdot.org/story/11/08/25/1245200/Rob-CmdrTaco-Malda-Resigns-From-Slashdot">leaving Slashdot</a>?</p>
<p>I started Slashdotting relatively late in the game (though I did get one of the last 6 digit UIDs!), but it&#39;s been an essential part of my mornings ever since. In a sea of rigged, inflated, ego driven news aggregation sites that are as fleeting as they are difficult to read without your brains turning to mush, Slashdot has been a pleasant, mildly ego driven news aggregation site with some fascinating conversations over the years.</p>
<p>Apple will live on without Steve, HP will survive without their PC division, and Slashdot will still be churning out stories without CmdrTaco. Whether it&#39;ll ever be the same is another question.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the hard work Rob. Hope we gave you enough fish.</p>
