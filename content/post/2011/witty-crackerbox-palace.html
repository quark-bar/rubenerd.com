<blockquote><p>&quot;I was so young when I was born&quot;<br />
<cite>~ George Harrison, Crackerbox Palace</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>In high school I used to tell people I was born at a young age. I thought I was being so original and witty. Son, I am disappoint. <cite>Photo by <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/wiki/File:George-Harrison-playing.jpg">Steve Mathieson</a>, who didn&#39;t disappoint.</cite></p>
