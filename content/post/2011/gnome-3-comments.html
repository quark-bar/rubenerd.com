<p>I got some great feedback from people on my <a href="//rubenerd.com/review-of-gnome-3/">Gnome 3 review post</a>, which in itself was a comment in a way. Is that GTK3+ Inception?</p>

<h3>Arnold on Gnome 3 and KDE 4</h3>
<blockquote><p>I tried to use GNOME 3 when I was utterly disappointed by Unity in Ubuntu 11.04. And after three days of trying it still felt very wrong to me and too many functions were missing. I ended doing the unthinkable (at least for me) and tried Kubuntu with their latest KDE desktop. I was completely shocked. Everyone was telling me before how bad KDE is and then I was finding out more and more how very wrong they were. After a couple of days of getting used to it and discovering different ways of doing things with KDE I actually find it even better than the good old GNOME 2. Looks like KDE will be a keeper for me.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s funny, I had the exact opposite response with KDE4 and Gnome3! I guess that’s one of the strengths of having multiple environments, each to their own :)</p>
<h3>dai1313 on Gnome 3 issues</h3>
<blockquote><p>Nice review.</p>
<p>Wow, there is a lot of glitches there, and I got it when it hit testing.</p>
<p>Also, I usually don’t do this shameless plug thing here – but I wrote a review too if you want to read it. <a href="http://ignorance.kokidokom.net/2011/04/gnome-3-review/">http://ignorance.kokidokom.net/2011/04/gnome-3-review/</a></p></blockquote>
<p>A much better review than mine, and by a guy who also blogs random infocomm stuff laced with a solid dose of anime goodness. Or is it the other way round? Either way, his desktop background rocks.</p>
