<p>You ain&#39;t seen nothing until you see it represented by an application that isn&#39;t Y2K compliant! I suppose the developers figured nobody would be running their otherwise awesome software in 2000, let alone 2011 ;).</p>
<p>The screenshot is of Brown Bag Software&#39;s PowerMenu System for DOS, released in 1987. Obviously the date was stored as a two digit integer, but instead of resetting to 0 after 1999, that two digit number just kept incrementing! Curiously, its almost as if they expected this behavior, because the clock&#39;s &quot;frame&quot; even expanded to fit the extra digit.</p>
