<p>If there was any remaining doubt in our minds that winter is on its way, they were erased after today&#39;s freezer! More dramatic than the temperature itself though has been how suddently the snap startedâ€¦ I took those two pictures within days of each other. With a low of 4 predicted tonight, suddently the 15 I was whinging about on Sunday seems practically luxurious!</p>
<p><a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Luxembourg">Luxurious</a> would have pretty cold winters. Would still like to go there though one day. I hear they export dentures. Do dentures chatter in the cold like my teeth are right now?</p>
