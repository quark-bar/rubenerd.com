<blockquote><p>Dr Tony Tan has been voted Singapore’s seventh president, in a race that had just 7,269 votes separating him and runner-up Dr Tan Cheng Bock. [..] 35.2% of 2.1 million voters threw their support behind the former deputy prime minister. ~ <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/The-Big-Story/The-Big-Story-1/Story/STIStory_706809.html">Straits Times</a></p></blockquote>
