<blockquote cite="http://shop.nordstrom.com/s/starbucks-alexander-wang-unisex-tee/3228567"><p>The iconic Starbucks logo is reimagined by designer and 2008 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund winner Alexander Wang on a soft knit tee. The exclusive style was designed to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the iconic coffee company.</p></blockquote>
<p>The only catch: it&#39;s AU$91. I suppose its true what they say, Starbucks coffee is good, though a little overpriced ;). Still, a brilliant design, and I&#39;d also feel less conspicuous if I spilled coffee on it in public.</p>
