<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/icon.mac.imagecapture.png" alt="" style="height:128px; width:128px; float:right;" class="transparent" />I was going mad trying to figure out why <a title="Wikipedia article on Image Capture" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Image_Capture">Image Capture.app</a> wasn&#39;t saving any images from my scanner this afternoon. Turns out the destination drive I&#39;d selected was <strong>completely out of of drive space</strong>. I would have appreciated at least some error or warning from either the Finder or Image Capture, but at least I figured it out eventually!</p>
<p>Passing this nugget of information on for what it may be worth if you&#39;re having/had/sandwich a similar issue.</p>
