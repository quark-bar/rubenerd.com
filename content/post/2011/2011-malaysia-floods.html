<p>Some <a title="MalaysiaKini: More flood evacuees return home" href="http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/155464">good news</a> from Malaysia. Well sort of, 24,000+ people is still a heck of a lot.</p>
<blockquote><p>The number of flood evacuees in Johor and Malacca has dropped to 24,712 this morning as floodwaters continue to recede in the affected areas of the two states.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Brazil</strong>, <strong>Malacca</strong> and <strong>Johor</strong> in Malaysia, <strong>Queensland</strong> and <strong>Victoria</strong> in Australiaâ€¦ all in the space in a month. And then there were those floods in Singapore last year (<a title="Entry: An Irish sandwich refuge in Singapore" href="http://rubenerd.com/obriens-singapore/">#1</a>, <a title="Entry: How rude: Singapore flashes a flood" href="http://rubenerd.com/singapore-flashes-a-flood/">#2</a>). There&#39;s definitely something going on.</p>
