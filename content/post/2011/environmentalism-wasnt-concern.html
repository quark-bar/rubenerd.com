<p>They were out in full force this weekend in <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Earlwood,+NSW,+Australia">Earlwood</a>. Over two days I had flyers handed to me about an End of The World seminar by the Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, a Baptist pledge drive and an invitation for a &quot;dianetic reading&quot; for the low, low price of $1500. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo0Ijfea9NA">Pieces of Sweet Stars Yoko</a> couldn&#39;t wait!</p>
<p>Ironically, just as people did with material from The Greens, these flyers were littered all around the street shortly after. Seems <em>&quot;Ruining The Earth&quot;</em> is a self fulfilling prophecy.</p>
