<p>On Twitter this afternoon <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Rubenerd/status/123284932834496512">I said</a> I couldn&#39;t justify posting a moe picture here for <em>Moe Day 2011</em> given I&#39;d only just posted <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/anime-can-i-have-one-too-please/" title="Friday 07th October 2011: [Anime] Can I have one too please?">this picture</a> of Mugi-Chan recently. <a href="http://mobile.twitter.com/sebasu_tan/status/123285221939486720">@Sebasu<em>tan</a> and <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/hanezawakirika/status/123285295021047808">@hanezawakirika</a> would have none of that however, and told me to post another one anyway. Then I was sent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pixiv.net/member</em>illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=21336350&quot;&gt;the adorable picture</a> you see above, and was encouraged to blog about it!</p>
<p>This could very well be the first entirely crowdsourced blog post in Rub&eacute;nerd.com&#39;s 4054 post history. I need more of these ^_^.</p>
