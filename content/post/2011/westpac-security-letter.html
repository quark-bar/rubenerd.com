<p>After <a href="http://rubenerd.com/westpac-bank-internet-security/">recently voicing my concerns</a> about their internet banking policy here, Westpac sent me a cover letter and pamphlet this morning that discuss card and internet banking security.</p>
<p>My old man and sister are also Westpac account holders, but neither received a letter like this which leads me to two possible conclusions. Either I was statistically chosen at random based on the fact I use their internet banking services and debit cards, or someone at Westpac reads my blog and wanted to appease me. Because the latter is more fun, I&#39;m going to assume it.</p>
