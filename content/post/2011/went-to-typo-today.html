<p>I didn&#39;t licence my name under the GPL, Richard Stallman stole it! True story.</p>

<p>Posters aside, I haven&#39;t bought decorative things in a long time, I&#39;ve been trying to reduce the amount of stuff I own. Every now and then though, it&#39;s worth it :).</p>
<p>For those not in the know, <a href="http://typoshop.com.au/">Typo</a> is a store in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore that advertises itself as a <em>&quot;one stop concept store&quot;</em>, whatever that means. What I do know is its quite possibly the greatest stationary and design shop out there, even if admitting this will have certain people label you a hipster. They shouldn&#39;t bother, they can just buy labels at Typo.</p>
