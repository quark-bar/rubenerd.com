<blockquote cite="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/09/why-you-should-root-for-college-to-go-online/244834/"><p>If tuition costs slow their fierce rise, it will be because we figure out how to take some elements of college and put them online. How’s that going? Slowly. Very slowly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Leaving aside their unfortunate use of the word <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=root">root</a>, such stories that serve to promote the idea of online education always miss one critical point. Particularly for IT, what you learn is secondary to the connections in academia and industry you make.</p>
<p>The author also assumes that tuition fees will be more affordable if classes are taught online, presumably because cost savings will be passed on. Methinks they&#39;re being a little na&iuml;ve.</p>
