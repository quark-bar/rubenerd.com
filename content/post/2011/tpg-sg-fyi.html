<blockquote><p>TPG to move Australia head to Singapore: Report</p></blockquote>
<p>TPG? Really? Would his head be moving to Singapore to learn how to run efficient ISPs, presumably with the rest of his body?</p>
<blockquote><p>SINGAPORE &#8211; US private equity firm TPG is relocating its Australia head Ben Gray to Singapore from Sydney as it seeks growth in Asia, the Dow Jones reported Thursday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, so it&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPG_Capital">this TPG</a> not <a href="http://www.tpg.com.au/">this TPG</a>. Another pitfall of registering your company with a TLA, or to a lesser extent with an ETLA. IMHO.</p>
