<p>Certainly with regards to Facebook: nah. At least, not long term anyway. I&#39;d stake my reputation as the most respected person on Rub&eacute;nerd.com on it. None of the other writers here have anything on me.</p>
<p>That said, Wall Street doesn&#39;t need to worry about being profitable, they&#39;ll get a bailout if they screw up, right? Its corporate welfare which (unlike those super evil commies that want it for regular people) is totally okay! Not that I&#39;m cynical or anything. Or cyclical, I don&#39;t have a bike yet.</p>
