<p>Yesterday&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Picture_of_the_day/October_2011#October_5_-_Wed">photo of the day</a> on Wikipedia is an amazingly detailed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bangkok_Night_Wikimedia_Commons.jpg">night shot of Bangkok</a>, taken by Benh Lieu Song. More desktop background material!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been to Bangkok heaps of times: on school camps, en route to other places, and for holidays. If you follow the Thai-Malay Peninsula, its the next city along from Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. It&#39;s an overwhelming place, its so gigantic and busy and loud and colourful. There are huge, modern buildings alongside museums housing the King&#39;s royal barges and ancient temples. The people are friendly and the food is amazing. One step down the wrong street, and you can become completely lost. </p>
<p>It&#39;s a shame how many (most?) Westerners only think of the sex trade and pretty boys when Bangkok is brought up.</p>
