<p>Was a &quot;flat filing cabinet&quot; for weeks while I was feeling ill. I actually have space now!</p>
<p>Next step, some more cable ties. The IKEA racks that keep the cables tidy under the desk are starting to max out. Not that I&#39;m trying to think of another excuse to go to IKEA, mind.</p>
