<p>It&#39;s sad, now that I&#39;ve actually <strong>seen</strong> Madoka Magica, I can&#39;t bring myself to have Kyuubee in the same desktop backgrounds as any of the girls! Which is a shame, because the series has generated a huge amount of really beautiful art, much of which is perfect for backgroundisation! Is that a term?</p>
