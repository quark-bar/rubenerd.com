<p>Anyone else notice Wikimedia Common&#39;s <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/wiki/Commons:Picture_of_the_day">Picture of the day</a>  today?</p>

<h3>No Ruben, do tell!</h3>

<h3>Okay then, so what?</h3>
<p>Aside from being a really colourful and creative image in its own right (love the light coming in through the trees onto the Shinto gate), I applaud the editors at Wikimedia for not only allowing material like this, but gracing their homepage with it for a day and tagging it as <span style="font-style:italic;">&quot;a featured picture on Wikimedia Commons&quot;</span> and  <span style="font-style:italic;">&quot;This image has been assessed using the Quality image guidelines and is considered a Quality image&quot;</span>. Seriously!</p>
<p>I think it speaks volumes about our culture that images like this warrent a <abbr style="border-bottom:1px dotted" title="not safe for work">NSFW</abbr> warning, but gory violence where people are graphically maimed or killed is perfectly acceptable, or at the very least is more leniently censored. I have my suspicions as to why that is, but at the risk of getting into further trouble, I won&#39;t discuss it here!</p>
<p>This was the first &#8212; and will be the last &#8212; NSFW image on Rub&eacute;nerd.com. I hope I didn&#39;t offend, or at the very least scar you for life!</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It seems the image isn’t the picture of the day anymore, in the time I wrote this it changed to something completely different. There’s a Monty Python reference in there somewhere. Anyway, dang timezones, I keep forgetting their servers are in the US! There’s probably an archive of previous pictures of the day somewhere on their site.</p>
