<p>I don&#39;t play many games, I prefer working on projects and blogging personally :). So when a friend of mine wanted to install Steam on my Mac Pro, it was more than willing to accommodate my wishes by not installing.</p>

<h3>The procedure on not working</h3>
<p><strong>1.</strong> When installed in <code>/Applications</code>, complain when it discovers the file system is set to case-sensitive HFS+.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> When installed in a virtual disk image formatted with case-insensitive HFS+, complain when it installs its Application Data files in the user&#39;s Library folder, which is of course located on the aforementioned case-sensitive HFS+ file system.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> When a symbolic link is created between the Steam data folder and a folder on the disk image to accommodate these two problems:</p>
<pre>
% cd ~/Library/Application Data
% ln -s /Volumes/SteamStuff/Steam ./Steam
</pre>
<p>… then take an age to load, and finally crash.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>
<p>So it seems Steam and most Adobe products <strong>refuse</strong> to run on case-sensitive file systems, and many of my *nix software either <strong>prefer</strong> or <strong>mandate</strong> they run on case-sensitive file systems. No prizes for guessing which I choose to accommodate!</p>
<p>That&#39;s not to say I&#39;m not glad other Mac users with more orthodox file system and software choices are able to play games, just personal preference.</p>
