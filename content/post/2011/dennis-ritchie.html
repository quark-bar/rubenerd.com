<p>Whereas there are those that shine in the limelight and are celebrated in the general public for their contributions, there are the quieter ones in the background who&#39;s wisdom and genius benefit all of humanity.</p>

<h3>His legacy is the amazing tech world we have now</h3>
<p>Dennis Ritchie was one of the true computing pioneers. He was the R in the K&amp;R C Programming Language; a tome which all computer science students and programmers have studied, language designers have used as inspiration, and upon which much of the world&#39;s software has been developed. The descendents (direct and indirect) of the UNIX operating system he co-developed power the world&#39;s fastest supercomputers, the Internet, workstations, phone networks, and quite possibly the handset in your pocket. </p>
<p>C and UNIX haven&#39;t been without their critics or detractors, but it&#39;s hard to imagine the world without them, or argue that they haven&#39;t have a profound effect not just on our industry, but the entire world. Its a testament to his principals that decades later we&#39;re all still using this language and descendents of this system even in our latest generation of devices, software and networks that are continuing to make our world a smaller, more connected place.</p>
<p>We have truly lost one of the world&#39;s greatest minds today. I will miss his brilliance, but also his famed modesty and gentle good nature. On a personal level, he was a teacher and mentor whom I never got the chance to meet, but whom I&#39;ve looked up to since I was a child first wanting to explore computing.</p>
<p>I hope as he lay his head down to rest for that one final time that he appreciated just how many lives he has touched.</p>
<h3>Most fitting way I can think of</h3>
<p>I&#39;ll anger the standards bodies for this, but derived from his definitive work.</p>
