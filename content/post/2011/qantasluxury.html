<p>How to further destroy a brand, show how utterly and bafflingly out of touch you are, and create a subject that generates <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTCwPlWzZnQ">video parodies</a> in less than 12 hours, within weeks of grounding your entire fleet over a pay dispute after your CEO rewards himself with millions.
