<p>The illustrious, talented and super friendly <a href="http://www.esthergolton.com/">Esther Golton</a> in Alaska. Independent singer songwriter, hammer dulcimer player and flutist. Floutist? Fluteist? Flautist? Ah okay, the spell checker liked that last one.</p>
<p>I have <strong>Unfinished Houses</strong> and <strong>Aurora Borealis: A Conversation with Alaska&#39;s Northern Lights</strong>, signed and everything! ^______^ When was the last time you got that from a commercial, mainstream artist I ask you right now?!</p>
