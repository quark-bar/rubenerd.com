<p>It&#39;s been more than a year since we were told about her… is she ever going to appear?</p>

<h3>Akane who?</h3>
<p>For those who don&#39;t remember who haven&#39;t been subscribed to my blog for very long [you&#39;re a wise person] back in March 2010 <em>K-On!</em> fans were treated to a series of character profile images depicting a new character in the form of Miura Akane.</p>
<p><a title="Saturday 13th March 2010: [Anime] A new K-On character with a… tuba!?" href="//rubenerd.com/anime-kon-tuba/">I posted them on Rubenerd.com</a> at the time, and commented that a tuba player in the Light Music Club playing a tuba was simply too awesome for words. A number of you left comments echoing my sentiment!</p>
<p>As I said at the time, not only would the idea of having an adorable moeblob character playing an instrument that&#39;s almost as large as she is would be highly entertaining to watch, it&#39;s such an unconventionally bizarre and wonderful instrument to have in a pop music group! As I&#39;ve been saying since I got into jazz and swing in my late years of primary school:</p>
<h3>Everything sounds better with brass!</h3>
<p>It&#39;s true. Prove me otherwise. I dare you.</p>
<p>So we return to the present. Wait, how does one return to the present, if we were talking about the past? I&#39;d make a lousy time traveler, I&#39;d barely be able to form sentenced discussing where I was, let alone operate the devices used to transport me. But I digress.</p>

<p>Where is Akane Miura? Whatever happened to her? Has she appeared in the manga yet? Apparently, I haven&#39;t been the only one thinking about this… leave it to the demotivational poster folk to come up with this ;).</p>
<p>I wonder if she&#39;ll appear in the movie? <em>Miura Akane</em> doesn&#39;t seem like a very British name!</p>
