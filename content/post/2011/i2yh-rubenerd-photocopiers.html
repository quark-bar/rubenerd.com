<p><a href="https://twitter.com/i2yh">Neal</a> from the <a href="http://www.intoyourheadpodcast.com/aaaapodcastblog/">Into Your Head</a> and <a href="http://onsug.com/archives/category/neal">Over Your Head</a> shows on his first experience with photocopiers:</p>
<blockquote><p>@Rubenerd No but he once let me photocopy a drawing of a cat on office equipment after hours. Donâ€™t tell the newspapers. <a href="https://twitter.com/i2yh/status/62850447521742849">#</a></p>
<p>@Rubenerd That was back in the early eighties. Photocopying was like going to the moon back then. Especially if you were six years old. <a href="https://twitter.com/i2yh/status/62850901370609664">#</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Granted my first experience with photocopying stuff at my dad&#39;s office was in the mid nineties, but as he was I was captivated by this almost magic machine that could take a picture and make tons of identical copies of it! I also liked how smooth and glossy the toner felt compared to the crappy colour dot matrix ink from our Fujitsu printer at home ;).</p>
<p>Ten years later I was in high school and using the library&#39;s photocopier to reproduce chapers from borrowed books to put in my so-called &quot;Photocopy Folder of Ruben&#39;s Interests&quot;. By which I mean I cleared the rights for copyright in advance. Yeah, that&#39;s it.</p>
