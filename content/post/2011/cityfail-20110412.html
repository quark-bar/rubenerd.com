<p>It was a good thing I didn&#39;t need to go into uni today given two dreaded words from CityRail: <strong>Major Delays</strong>.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic">Apoliogies for the crappiness of the picture, I took it with my iTelephone with HDR in broad daylight with the sun shining directly on the displays. Only by distorting it like this did the words become readable!</p>
<h3>Let me tell you a tale</h3>
<p>Since I was young enough to venture out into this big world by myself, I&#39;ve preferred trains to buses. They&#39;re infinitely smoother, quieter, I can read on them without getting car sickness, and given the direction of their travel is fixed I feel safter knowing the driver won&#39;t suddently change course or decide to take me somewhere different. I&#39;m a terribly socially awkward person you see, so anything to reduce the number of variables when I&#39;m in that giant room with the blue ceiling is welcome.</p>
<p>While all that is true (at least in my opinion) they&#39;re certainly no less or more reliable than buses. While I&#39;ve had my fair share of bus breakdowns, trains in Sydney especially seem to have a mind of their own. We can&#39;t go for a month or two without some form of trackwork, and sudden disruptions because of reason XYZ.</p>
<h3>The Tale… of Alan A’Dale</h3>
<p>Today&#39;s disruption was due to <em>&quot;signal equipment repairs&quot;</em>, and it wasn&#39;t planned. Turns out due to a fault in the signaling systems, commuters across the network (including on our line) suddently found their trains not moving for over an hour; would have been wickidly fun if you were trapped underground for that time period.</p>
<p>On the surface, my fellow train travellers and I watched the time tick by while we waited for trains, all the while with this sign on the electonic notification screen thingy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Major Service Disruption: There is major disruption on the network due to essential signal equipment repairs. More information will be provided when available.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jacob Saulwick from The Sydney Morning Herald had <a title="Solution to smooth tracks five years behind schedule " href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/solution-to-smooth-tracks-five-years-behind-schedule-20110412-1dcq6.html">this to say</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>YESTERDAY was one of the worst days on Sydney’s train system for six years, triggered by multiple signal failures during the morning peak hour at a critical junction on the network.</p>
<p>The problems started at 7.40am when two signalling systems at Sydenham control centre stopped working.</p>
<p>Trains on the Bankstown, Inner West, South, Airport, East Hills, Eastern Suburbs and Illawarra lines were immediately brought to a halt; some at platforms, some stuck between platforms.</p></blockquote>
<p>And if you want to see some incredible pictures, <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/hardware-failure-triggers-sydney-train-chaos-20110412-1dbhk.html">this article</a> by Georgina Robinson has them. Wow, just wow.</p>
<h3>The phew is the flew</h3>
<p>So I went to our local station to take that terrible picture, then came back home again to keep working on my assignments and whatnot. Glad I didn&#39;t have to commute today, that&#39;s for sure.</p>
<p>Hey <a href="//rubenerd.com/one-layer-of-leaves-after-the-elections/">Barry O&#39;Farrell</a>, weren&#39;t you going to fix this?</p>
