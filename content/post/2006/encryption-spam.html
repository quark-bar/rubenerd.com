<p>That&#39;s precious! Military Grade Encryption? If this bulk email is an example of how a business builds awareness of their &quot;Military Grade Encryption&quot; I wonder if government agencies send their encryption information to millions of people through insecure email? Oh boy.</p>
<p>And they&#39;re concerned with my comfort levels? Comfort???</p>
<p>These spammers <strong>are</strong> as stupid as they look.</p>
