<p><strong>Typing as we speak in the Boat Deck Cafe in Mawson Lakes. Coffee is good.</strong></p>
<p>Okay people, so I&#39;ve decided to revive the blog again. Lets just say that without it for a few months I was missing being able to spontaneously add stuff whenever I want, instead of waiting till the next episode of the <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">Rubenerd Show</a>.</p>
<p>I am changing the direction of this blog though I think to be more of a link blog than an article blog, if you get my drift. I post all the time to my <a href="http://del.icio.us/rubenerd">Del.icio.us</a> link account and so often I find I want to write a longer description or add a picture.</p>
<p>If you found this blog through Google or Vivisimo (my new favourite search engine) or some other engine, you can find the Rubenerd Show at <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">RubenerdShow.com</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, long story short, it&#39;s good to be back in the blogosphere :).</p>
