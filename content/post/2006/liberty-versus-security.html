<p>The version I knew was &quot;Those who would sacrifice liberty for security will <strong>achieve</strong> neither&quot;, but this passage seems even better. :)</p>
<p>It&#39;s a real shame that Australia is following the way of the United States in terms of &quot;national security&quot;. The way I see it, if we radically alter our lives by making them more complicated and difficult, the terrorists have won already.</p>
<p>I remember listening to <a href="http://lessig.org/blog">Lawrence Lessig</a> give a talk on <a href="http://itconversations.com/">IT Conversations</a> about copyright law and how a restrictive change can be implemented very easily, but it can take a very long time to undo. I think the same applies to this as well.</p>
