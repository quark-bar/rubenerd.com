<p>So Apple has released an official working beta of a software program that will let users <strong>install Microsoft Windows XP</strong> on a Mac, and it&#39;s called Boot Camp.</p>

<p>I think Windows is a piece of trash but I would like to install it on my MacBook Pro so I can play games :). I won&#39;t connect the Windows boot partition to the internet though… and to think Windows users type credit card numbers in to their machines, it&#39;s seriously frightening.</p>
<p>Anyway, as usual I expected Apple to take a few shots at Microsoft Windows, and they didn&#39;t fail me :D …</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>EFI and BIOS</h2>
<p>Macs use an ultra-modern industry standard technology called EFI to handle booting. Sadly, Windows XP, and even the upcoming Vista, are stuck in the 1980s with old-fashioned BIOS. But with Boot Camp, the Mac can operate smoothly in both centuries.</p>
<h2>Word to the Wise</h2>
<p>Windows running on a Mac is like Windows running on a PC. That means it’ll be subject to the same attacks that plague the Windows world. So be sure to keep it updated with the latest Microsoft Windows security fixes.
