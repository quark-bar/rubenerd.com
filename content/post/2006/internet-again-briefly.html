<p>Rubenerd Blog on location! Har Har :)</p>
<p>Coming to you from some random McDonalds in the middle of nowhere between Canberra and Sydney… my first time I&#39;ve had internet access since my last post!</p>
<p>Trip so far has been great, crossed a timezone, been to Melbourne and Canberra and taken a ton of photos, but I don&#39;t have time to upload any right now, and this wireless network isn&#39;t the fastest thing in the world!</p>
<p>Rubenerd Shows will be coming to you again when I arrive in Adelaide, got a ton of audio footage I&#39;m going to play, is going to be awesome so stay tuned :).</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
