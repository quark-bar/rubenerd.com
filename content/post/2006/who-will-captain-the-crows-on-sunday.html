<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/media.250px-Adelaide_Crows_logo.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>WHO CARES? Am I the only Aussie who honesty doesn&#39;t give a damn about AFL? I believe so. Why do I not give a damn about AFL?</p>
<ul>
<li>Its primitive &#8211; grab balls, run, kickâ€¦ must have a pretty high IQ for that</li>
<li>Why do I want to watch jocks in tiny little shorts groping each other?</li>
<li>It came from Victoria!</li>
</ul>
<p>Enough said.</p>
