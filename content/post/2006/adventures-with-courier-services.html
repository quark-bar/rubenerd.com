<p>So I put an electronic item on eBay recently, and I wanted to send it to someone in Sydney NSW. Due to me residing in Adelaide SA I wanted to courier it instead of posting it seeing as it was fragile, but could I get a straight answer from anyone? Let&#39;s recap.</p>
<p><strong>First Candidate: DHL Australia</strong></p>

<p>DHL is pretty well known, and reputable, so I thought I&#39;d give them a shot. After jumping through several hoops to actually talk to a real person, a recorded voice chimed that I should call back during their office hours of 9am to 5pm. It was 4:35pm. I wasn&#39;t impressed with this &#39;reputable&#39; message, so I gave them the flick.</p>
<p><strong>Second Candidate: Star Track Express</strong></p>

<p>Star Track Express is an Aussie courier and frieght business so I thought I&#39;d support local! I gave them a call, and after going through the usual button pushing, I was put onto a customer service personidge. He collected all the details of the package, my phone number and name, my address and what my hobbies are, then FINALLY asked what company I represented. I said I was an individual. &quot;Sorry, this is only for business. CLICK&quot;. Thanks for wasting my time.</p>
<p><strong>Third Candidate: Australia Express</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/media.courier_ae.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>So I was getting a bit agitated with all this courier stuff, so I decided to try a local business from here in Adelaide, seeing as Australia Express had a subsidery called: AdelaideExpress! I gave them a call and went through the entire debarkle again, in the end she told me to call TNT. Fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>Forth Candidate: TNT Australia</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/media.courier_tnt.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>From experience, apparently because I&#39;m an individual I&#39;m the bird flu for corporate couriers, so I asked up front if they would send my package seeing as I was an individual. &quot;Nup&quot;. Okay then, do you know someone who will? &quot;Um… err… well there&#39;s… no wait… um… yeah… theres… Pack n Send, I think&quot;. Okay do you know their number? &quot;Nope&quot;. Thanks for that.</p>
<p><strong>Pack and Send</strong></p>

<p>There are humans on the other end of call centre phones! I could not have had such a positive experience. I should have jotted down her name so I could tell her supervisor, but she couldn&#39;t have been more helpul. I didn&#39;t need to give her every scrap of personal detail, all I needed was the weight and size of the box, and the postcode I was going to send it to. I got a confirmed cost, a confirmed address drop off (which is just down the street!). My faith in humanity is restored!</p>
<p><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong></p>
<p>Don&#39;t waste your time with all those other courier services who couldn&#39;t give a damn, give <a href="http://www.packsend.com.au/mainlink/prod_serv.htm">Pack and Send</a> a go :).</p>
