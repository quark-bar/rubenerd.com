<p>I use the wireless network at the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf at <a href="http://www.suriaklcc.com.my/">KLCC</a> (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) quite regularly while sipping away at the greatest beverage in the universe (I&#39;ll give you three guesses, it&#39;s not tea, and the last two guesses don&#39;t count).</p>
<p>I came home though and when I was looking through my browser history for… um… let&#39;s call it a page on how to be a better person… yeah that works… and I found the address of the login page that the browser on this machine automatically comes up with when you connect to the wireless network. I clicked on it and you can still access it!</p>
<p>So if you want to pretend you&#39;re in a Malaysian WiFi hotspot, get yourself a nice tall cup of coffee or (<em>teh tarik</em> works too!), change your desktop to a picture of Taman KLCC, <a href="http://203.115.193.232/upload/rlogin.aspx?loginurl=http://hs.airzed.com:8080/goform/HtmlLoginRequest">and surf over to the AirZed wireless page</a>!</p>
