<p>The Queen is here now for the Commonwealth Games, and according to the British media, the trip will be her last.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A smiling Queen Elizabeth II showed no sign of fatigue as she arrived in Australia for what some say will be the ageing monarch’s last overseas trip.</p>
<p>This week’s visit &#8211; to open the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne &#8211; is her 15th since the then newly-crowned Queen first visited Australia with her husband Prince Philip in 1954.</p>
<p>With the monarch turning 80 next month, British newspapers have speculated that she will hand over more of her duties to her eldest son, Prince Charles, including her travel.</p>
