<p>So here&#39;s the dillema: I have two email addresses, my gmail account for general use, and the university email address forâ€¦ university use!</p>
<p>Both email systems are web-based, which has two downsides: it means I have to login to two seperate websites several times a day, which is a right royal pain in the rear end, so ultimately what I&#39;d like to do is to have my uni email AND the Gmail email (that sounds cool) download into one mail client, either Mozilla Thunderbird or the Apple Mail.app program.</p>
<p><img src="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/media.logo2.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>But herein lies the problem: the uni network uses the incredible, open standards, open source software suite called Microsoft Exchange (note the sarcasm), which is impossible to get working with anything other than Microsoft&#39;s own proprietary-protocol compatible programs, such as Craplook or Craplook Express. So that rules out use with Thunderbird and Apple Mail.</p>

<p>Plus, apparently, you can set up Gmail to use POP3 to download your messages into a mail client of your choice, but as of yet neither Thunderbird or Apple Mail have been able to make a successful connection.</p>
<p>Now with the internet back online at home (???) I&#39;m going to try again. Wish me luck, it looks as though I&#39;ll need it!</p>
