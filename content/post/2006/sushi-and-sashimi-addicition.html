<p>I used to think I liked Sushi and Sashimi.</p>
<p>Then I thought I really liked it.</p>
<p>Now that I&#39;ve started dreaming about it and having it sometimes twice a day, I think addiciton is probably a more fitting term!</p>
<p>Kevin (my room mate) and I just came back from a Sushi Bar in Northgate (shopping centre in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, as the name implies) for my fourth serve of the stuff in one and a half days. My favourites by far are the salmon sashimi and sushi with tuna. The sushi with avocado atop the seaweed is also tantalising, but can be a tad filling after you&#39;ve had a few!</p>
<p>I think I&#39;m training myself to take a bit more heat too, the Rubenerd Wasabi/SoySauce Ratio is narrowing every time, though I make sure to only dab a minute amount on as not to smother the flavour of the sashimic goodness.</p>
<p>The girls at the sushi bars here are very friendly and nice too, haha!</p>
