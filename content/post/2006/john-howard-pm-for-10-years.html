<p>John Howard has now been the Prime Minister of The Commonwealth of Australia for 10 years.</p>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/media.howard.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Let&#39;s see what he&#39;s achieved for this great country during his decade term in office:</p>
<ul>
<li>The worst environmental record of any Australian government for over 50 years</li>
<li>Throwing out any chance of Australia becoming a republic during his term, keeping the Queen of the United Kingdom our head of state. We are not an independent country, just a &#39;self governing Commonwalth nation&#39;.</li>
<li>Sucking up to the US and making Australia a mere state of the US in the eyes of the global community</li>
<li>Involving Australia in the illegal war in Iraq, a decision most Australians opposed, and many argue has made Australia more of a terrorist target not less</li>
<li>Reforms to higher education funding making studying expensive, despite the fact the finance minister Peter Costello received free university education himself</li>
<li>The GST</li>
<li>The removal of university textbooks from the GST excemption list</li>
<li>Supporting the mandatory detention of refugees in horrendus conditions despite the fact it is in breach of the United Nations human rights code</li>
</ul>
<p>Good work Mr Howard, looking foward to the next 10 years :).</p>
