<p>If you watch any form of commercially syndicated television, you no doubt would have seen many (many, many, many) times their latest advertisment talking about how Coles Supermarkets &quot;give discounts on the products that really matter&quot;; in this case baby products such as nappies etc.</p>
<p>The problem is, all the kids are being cared for by their mums, the mums are doing the grocery shopping and the checkout chicks have all the jobs at the… checkouts.</p>
<p>No dads anywhere. Because dads are blubbering ingrates who know nothing about raising children, or grocery shopping.</p>
<p>Hey, while you&#39;re at it Coles, get the dad in the next scene to come home from work and demand a home cooked dinner from the wife after she&#39;s finished ironing all his shirts for the next week.</p>
