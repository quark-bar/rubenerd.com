<p>I&#39;m sure if you&#39;re anywhere near as obsessed about operating systems as me you would have seen this graph from the <a href="">ComputerWorld website</a> floating around before, but I thought I&#39;d post it anyway:</p>

<p>While as a 6 year user of Apple I agree with the placement of Mac OS X, I&#39;m not sure I really agree with some of these other rankings. I really don&#39;t think Windows XP improved usability over Windows 2000; in fact (as anyone who reads this blog knows) I still use Windows 2000 for my Windows apps because I think it&#39;s more stable, usable (and easier on the eyes) than XP. And I think Vista is a hell of a lot worse than both of themâ€¦ having to wait 10 seconds for a new Windows Explorer window to appear just so it can have some tizzy eye candy? How does that improve usability?!</p>
<p>And what&#39;s with BeOS? Sure it didn&#39;t have many drivers but it was surely more usable than that. And is CP/M really that much worse than DOS? It sure as hell seemed more reliable to me than DOS! And where&#39;s Amiga Workbench? It would have to have at least a 6.5 ;). Or GeOS for the Commodore 128? Ah to hell with it, what about the BASIC interpreter for the VIC-20? Okay, scrap that last one.</p>
<p>I guess we&#39;ll have to agree to disagree with these rankings.</p>
