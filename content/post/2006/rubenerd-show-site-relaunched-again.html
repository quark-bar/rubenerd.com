<p>The Rubenerd Show website has been redesigned again! I&#39;m not sure which version I&#39;m up to, version 7 I think? Not sure. I&#39;ve honestly lost count!</p>
<p>Anyway the new site reflects the different recording locations, now Adelaide, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur so I thought saying Rubenerd Show Australia was a bit misleading.</p>
<p><strong>Episode Update:</strong> There are episodes coming to you soon; I have been having an insane amount of difficulty uploading shows but recently I might have found an alternative method of uploading, so stay tuned! Get it, stay tuned? We&#39;re talking about a radio show? Tuned!? Ah shaddup.</p>
<p>Hope you like the new site :) any feedback is appreciated!</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
