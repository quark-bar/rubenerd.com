<p>Just finished Israel&#39;s latest posts on The Overnightscape forums, he&#39;s now on his Japanese holiday. I&#39;m so green with envy I could walk through particularly lush foliage and be completely camouflaged.</p>
<p>He&#39;s got some interesting shots of the landscape around the apartment he&#39;s in, and they look surprisingly like Singapore (sans-powerlines). I won&#39;t post them here because he&#39;s moving them to his ImageBucket account at a later date, but if you want to see them for yourself, head over to the thread.</p>
<p>Israel Brown is the guy who does the <a href="http://crapandstuff.com/">Crap &amp; Stuff</a> podcast by the way: the &#39;sponsor&#39; of the latest Rubenerd Show for the 26th Feb 2006! ;).</p>
