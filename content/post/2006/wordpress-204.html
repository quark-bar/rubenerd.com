<p>Just upgraded my two WordPress powered sites to version 2.0.4. The <a href="//rubenerd.comshow.com/">Rubenerd Show</a> went from 2.0.3 to 2.0.4, and the <a href="//rubenerd.com/">Rubenerd Blog</a> went from 2.0.1.</p>
<p>If you <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress">read the instructions</a> (aka: RTFM) upgrades can be painless. I was very impressed, this was my first WordPress upgrade :).</p>
