<p>Is it just me or does anyone else flinch when the word &quot;freedom&quot; is mentioned these days?</p>
<p>Before you get any funny ideas I&#39;m in full support of democratic systems of government and capitalism (well, sort of) and I believe the idea of freedom is noble, but I think in the United States they&#39;ve said &quot;freedom&quot; so many times it&#39;s sadly become an overused cliche to us in the rest of the world. Say the word too many times, and it loses it&#39;s meaning, know what I mean?</p>
<p>Anyway enough yakking, where the hell are my freedom fries? :D</p>
