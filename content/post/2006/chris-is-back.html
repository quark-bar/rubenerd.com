<p>Just came back from the airport, the Chris is back! He actually just came back from Kuala Lumpur, just like me.</p>
<p>Though the flight scheduling was fun. His flight was supposed to arrive back around 0730-ish, but MAS being MAS had the flight delayed and delayed again… suffice to say we left the airport at 5 minutes to midday. Midday… 0730… close enough.</p>

<p>Has anyone else had adventures with Malaysia Airlines?</p>
