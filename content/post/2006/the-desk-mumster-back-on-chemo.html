<p>Today has been a real bummer. After a few months without chemotherapy, last week the mumster went down to KLCC to have a blood test. The results are in today, her tumour markers <em>have doubled</em>. We&#39;re not too sure whether this will mean she&#39;ll have to start treatment again this week or whether we can hold off till next week. Whatever the case, she&#39;ll be tired and in pain again for the next several months. She&#39;ll be sick during her anniversary and Christmas. F.U.S.</p>
<p>She has now been on treatment on and off for 10 years. I remember back in 1996 (or it could have been 1995) when I came out of school and she was there to walk us home. She said she had been to have an examination because she was a bit suspicious about a lump on her chest. And here we are in 2006 and it&#39;s still going. Sometimes it makes me upset, sometimes it makes me so <em>angry</em> I want to punch a hole through the drywall.</p>
<p>As for &quot;The Desk&quot;, I&#39;ve had a log on my machine since 1999 but now that I have been using WordPress on the <a href="http://rubenerdshow.com/">Rubenerd Show</a> and this blog for a fair while now I think it makes more sense to post them here. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll import the existing entries… that&#39;s roughly 365 per year (give or take a day or two I missed each month) since 1999… I&#39;m not sure that would be so wise… information overload!</p>
