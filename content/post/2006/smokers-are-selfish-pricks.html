<p>If I get one more lungfull of exhaled cigarette smoke from another ignorant, stupid, selfish, &quot;too cool for school&quot; person I will not be held responsible for my actions.</p>
<p>Get it into your fat heads, you&#39;re not cool, you don&#39;t look smart; wise up, or get out of my face.</p>
<p>And don&#39;t get me started on the filth of discarded cigarette butts which you seem unable to extinguish except if they come in contact with the soles of you shoes. Hey, here&#39;s an idea for you smart people, why don&#39;t you put them out on your face; then you can see what your body tissue looks like on the <em>inside</em>.</p>
<p>And Ruben ends his rant here!</p>
