<p>Okay, it&#39;s time one and for all to silence all those people who claim Windows XP is a great OS and that the only reason it&#39;s targeted is because most people use it!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/security_report_windows_vs_linux/#myth1">http://www.theregister.co.uk/security/security<em>report</em>windows<em>vs</em>linux/</a></p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/media.The_Register_r.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>These are my favourite bits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most oft-repeated myth regarding Windows vs. Linux security is the claim that Windows has more incidents of viruses, worms, Trojans and other problems because malicious hackers tend to confine their activities to breaking into the software with the largest installed base. This reasoning is applied to defend Windows and Windows applications.</p>
<p>This reasoning backfires when one considers that Apache is by far the most popular web server software on the Internet. Only 21% run Microsoftâ€™s Windows-based IIS.  IIS has long been the primary target for worms and other attacks, and these attacks have been largely successful. Yes, worms for Apache have been known to exist, such as the Slapper worm, but Apache worms rarely make headlines because they have such a limited range of effect, and are easily eradicated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And something regarding the kernel itself and why Windows will inveitably collapse upon itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Viruses, Trojans and other malware make it onto Windows desktops for a number of reasons familiar to Windows and foreign to Linux:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows has only recently evolved from a single-user design to a multi-user model</li>
<li>Windows is monolithic, not modular, by design</li>
<li>Windows depends too heavily on an RPC model</li>
<li>Windows focuses on its familiar graphical desktop interface</li>
</ul>
