<p>If you&#39;ve been hanging out for Rubenerd Show #69, it is coming, don&#39;t worry! I&#39;m not sure whether it&#39;s the Servage FTP timing out or whether it&#39;s our [hopefully temporarily] unreliable ADSL connection, but I get within 88% of uploading the latest show and it times out.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an offer to the Liberal Party, Labor Party, The Greens, The Democrats, Family First, Nick Xenophon, if you can promise me reliable internet in the South Australian elections next month, I&#39;ll vote for you.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe not the Liberals because they&#39;re right wing bastards. And scrap Family First too, the name is designed to hide their dangerous conservative agenda.</p>
