<p>It&#39;s so refreshing to get a more personal conformation email that isn&#39;t just &quot;You registered as XYZ. Please confirm.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m in the process of downloading the Mac OS X version of the <a href="http://opml.org">OPML Outliner</a>, it&#39;s going to be very interesting.</p>
