<p>Aside from the fact I can&#39;t stand not being able to even use a simple SSH session with my Servage account, it seems that Servage and WordPress just don&#39;t get along. Reading is fine, but I&#39;d say when I create a new post, WITHOUT FAIL every time it doesn&#39;t give me a confirmation message etc, it just throws me an error:</p>
<blockquote><p>ERROR</p>
<p>The requested URL could not be retrieved</p>
<p>While trying to retrieve the URL: http://rubenerd.com/wp-admin/post.php</p>
<p>The following error was encountered:</p>
<p>Zero Sized Reply</p></blockquote>
<p>So I roll my eyes each time, close that tab in Camino and, lo and behold, the post has been published.</p>
<p>Now I know it isn&#39;t just a corrupt installation or files, because I have three WordPress blogs running on Servage, and they ALL have this problem, not to mention the Rubenerd Forum throws a Zero Size Reply error occasionally too.</p>
<p>Anyone else on Servage have this stupid problem?</p>
