<p>I don&#39;t use Movable Type, but for the benefit of those of you who do:</p>
<blockquote><p>Movable Type 3.3 is now available. Current users of 3.0+ versions are entitled to update to Movable Type 3.3 at no cost. <a href="http://sixapart.rsc01.net/servlet/cc5?kHQSSYAQSRVjmILgkJoHKLxnuHptQJhuVaVS">Update today</a> to get these and many more great new features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tags: Readers can find content more easily and subscribe to custom feeds.</li>

<p>I&#39;ve been using widgets on the <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">Rubenerd Show</a> site which uses <a href="http://warpspire.com/hemingway">Hemingway</a> theme for <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and they&#39;re a great idea.</p>
