<p>Big band and swing music is too good!</p>
<p>I thought some of these lyrics from &quot;Drunk Daddy&quot; by the Cherry Poppin&#39; Daddies were pretty smart.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You arm is too short to box with God&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Okay dad you can beat me but youâ€™ll never beat me!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
