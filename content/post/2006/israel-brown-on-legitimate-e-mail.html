<p>Just a warning message, if you are not a human being don&#39;t email Israel Brown:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m still concentrating on other things right now. I just wanted to pop up for a bit to comment on something I received as e-mail recently. I say that I always answer my e-mail, and it is true &#8211; I answer legitimate e-mail from *people* who don’t talk like spam-bots.</p>
<p>If you write to me and say something like &#8220;hey dude, hows the crap an stuff hangin. r u japanese???hmm?&#8221; as one &#8220;person&#8221; did, I’m probably not going to say anything in reply.</p>
<p>However, if you have a real question to ask or want to discuss something, I’ll be more than happy to carry on a conversation! Oh, and if you don’t speak English too well or something, please say so, or else I’ll just assume that your message is spam or that you’re some idiot playing around.</p>
<p>If you haven’t heard all the shows, please give them a listen. Also, feel free to comment on anything. I always answer my legitimate e-mail.</p></blockquote>
