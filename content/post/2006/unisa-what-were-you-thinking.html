<p>To think I&#39;m going to a tech university that uses Microsoft ASP.net and Microsoft IIS… it makes me sick to my stomach.</p>
<p>Especially in this case because I just tried to check my uni email account, and for the seventh time in a row got this greeting:</p>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/media.unisawhoops.png" alt="IIS ASP Error" /></p>
<p>Where&#39;s the BAMP stack when you need it?! (BSD, Apache, MySQL and Perl, prefer to Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP… but both are much better than this crud they&#39;re serving up at my uni!!!)</p>
