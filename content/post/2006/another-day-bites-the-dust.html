<p>Well another day has come and gone; it&#39;s exactly 03:30 and I really should be going to bed now. You might be wondering &quot;wow Ruben stayed up on a Saturday night! He must have partied pretty hard there!&quot;</p>
<p>If by party you&#39;re referring to finishing this blog, putting the finishing touches on The Rubenerd Show website (the parent site to this blog), talking to Chris about uni courses and laughing my ass off with Kevin while watching a delayed telecast of David Letterman (episode from Friday in the US) then, yeah.</p>
<p>Good stuff :).</p>
