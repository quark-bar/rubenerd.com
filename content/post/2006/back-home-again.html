<p>As of one hour ago, the troops and I finally made it back to the outskirts of Adelaide, felt pretty good. We&#39;ve done a ton of stuff:</p>
<p><em>Links are to artciles in Wikipedia if you need clarification :)</em></p>
<h3>Melbourne (2 days)</h3>

<li>Driven along the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Ocean_Road">Great Ocean Road</a></li>

<li>Shopped in the CBD</li>

<li>Visited <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patterson_Lakes">Patterson Lakes</a> where I grew up over 12 years ago, very emotional!</li>

</ul>
<h3>Canberra (1 day)</h3>

</ul>
<h3>Sydney (3 days)</h3>

</ul>
<p>The Rubenerd Shows I recorded were done &#39;on location&#39; and thusly need some pretty hardcore processing before they&#39;re okay to distribute, so I&#39;ll be doing that over the next day or so.</p>
<p>Look out for photos soon too!</p>
