<p>Now this is a great idea: auction off a Ducati 999 decked out with Aussie Socceroos colours and decals for charity.</p>
<p>I&#39;d place a bid if it weren&#39;t for two critical problems: 1) that I don&#39;t have that much money, and 2) that I don&#39;t have a motorbike licence! But don&#39;t let me get in the way, bid and help people out.</p>
<blockquote><p>You are bidding for the chance to own a very special machine &#8211; the Ducati Superbike 999, custom finished to celebrate the Socceroos 2006 World Cup campaign. Hailed by the press as the best Twin ever produced, the new 999 has proved to its riders its power to win on tracks around the world. A look under its fairing confirms the 999’s state-of-the art technology. Ducati’s goal was to create a Ducati Superbike of stunning design that improves rider ergonomics, makes maintenance easier, reduces complexity of the motorcycle and offers performance second to none. The aerodynamics, mechanical and electronic components, chassis and running gear were developed first and styling followed.</p>
<p>The 999 features a fully adjustable suspension system. Upside-down 43 mm Showa forks with low friction TiN treatment and a Showa rear shock provide a smooth ride on all road and track conditions. And even more, the 999 is equipped with a new aluminium alloy rear swing-arm, like that on the 999 Factory racebike.</p>
<p>This auction will be run in conjunction with The 2006 Bandage Bear benefit night on August 19th. The night helps to support Illawarra Kids with Disabilities as well as cancer research at The Children’s Hospital at Westmead.</p>
