<p>Just saw another ad on television for another Kmart 20% off sale.</p>
<p>And my question is: does anyone out there really take notice of 10 or 20% off sales? Because when I see ad after ad for &quot;whopping 10% off mens clothing at Kmart&quot; I just groan. 10% off a $15.00 t-shirt (which would have been $2 after forex in Kuala Lumpur) is really no big deal.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/media.200px-Kmart.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Do Kmart have any statistics to prove that these &quot;whopping&quot; 10 to 20% off sales actually do anything for sales? Or is the whole thing just a cheap way of getting their brand out to the country? If it&#39;s the former, I guess it makes sense, but it sure doesn&#39;t affect my buying habits, and I&#39;m pretty sure masses of people don&#39;t swarm in with their &quot;incredible 10 to 20% off sales.&quot; If it&#39;s the latterâ€¦ well I guess they&#39;ve won over me if I&#39;m posting this!</p>
<p>But come on, enough with these pointless sales nobody cares about. Honesty. Give me 80% off and I&#39;ll take notice.</p>
