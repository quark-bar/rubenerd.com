<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Stewart">Song Playing: Dido, White Flag</a></strong></p>
<p>As I was typing the above line I almost put &quot;Dido, White Fag&quot;. Would have had an entirely different meaning!</p>
<p>My mum has now been on chemotherapy again for about a week. She seems to be coping a bit better with this round, though I guess &quot;coping&quot; is a relative term. She&#39;s in a lot of pain in her bones and joints but doesn&#39;t feel like being sick so I guess we can be thankful for that. As long as she takes it easy I&#39;m hoping she&#39;ll be okay.</p>
<p>She&#39;s on two separate treatments, one she&#39;s had before but also a newer one which instead of trying to attack the tumour cells and in the process doing a lot of damage to other perfectly good tissue instead attempts to block the cells blood supply. I&#39;m not sure how that works, but it is reassuring to know that new treatments are coming out all the time.</p>
<p>My dad left for Beijing last night; Shell has apparently purchased a Chinese oil company so he&#39;s over there to inspect their grease plant to see if it&#39;s useful. It&#39;s going to be -4 degrees this Thursday so sounds like fun! He says its surprising how some Singaporeans and Malay Chinese have a lot of difficulty communicating with Mainland Chinese because their work ethic and the way they use the language is so radically different. I was surprised, I just assumed that Mandarin Chinese was Mandarin Chinese.</p>
<p>Time Passesâ€¦</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m sitting here in my mum&#39;s bedroom with my MacBook Pro, she&#39;s on the iBook. It&#39;s 11:31 PM and I&#39;ve just made a cup of coffee, awesome! We&#39;re sitting here talking and typing away, it&#39;s nice.</p>
<p>She&#39;s saying now that she&#39;s been in contact with Dr. Fuad and that she&#39;ll be getting some stronger pain killers next time she goes into the hospital which I&#39;m sure will be a relief. I&#39;m worried about the pain she&#39;s feeling, is this normal for this medication? I worry way too much about these things, I&#39;m sure its fine but in the back of my head it worries me. Am I weird?</p>
<p>Anyway this coffee is getting cold and I can&#39;t stand typing with only one hand and drinking coffee with the other.</p>
