<p>I&#39;ll be 20 years old in exactly 10 days! So then I can safely say &quot;I hate teenagers&quot; without being a hypocrite ;)!</p>
<p>Anyway just watching that horrid TodayTonight show while doing my C++ and these were the tips I managed to pickup about Teenangers and coping:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Helpful tip for good parenting</strong><br />
Don’t argue over trivial things; it’s counter-productive</p>
<p><strong>What’s the number 1 drug that is used to spike drinks?</strong><br />
Alcohol</p>
<p><strong>When does the human brain fully develop?</strong><br />
At the age of 23!</p>
