<p>It seems our favourite <a href="http://newtimeradio.com/">New Time Radio</a> show presenter Frank Edward Nora now has one of these new-fangled blog things, almost the same time as I started the <a href="http://ruben.sg/">University Chronicles of Ruben</a>. That&#39;s spooky!</p>
<p>He has some of his YouTube submissions, as well as some of his <a href="http://theovernightscape.com/">Overnightscape</a> show episodes.</p>
<p>I rememeber for a while this very blog also had links to the latest <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">Rubenerd Shows</a> here too, but now the <em>Blog</em> and <em>Show</em> are two seperate projects with seperate content, rather than an aggregation blog which I think is what Frank is doing.</p>
<p>He&#39;s using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> (yeah!) with the black <a href="http://www.chait.net/index.php?p=228">WordPress DarkNight</a> theme.</p>
