<p>I went to bed at just past 11:30pm. I probably slept for about 1 hour, and I&#39;ve been tossing and turning in bed ever since 12:30. It&#39;s now 4:30 and I just jumped out of bed, thinking &quot;That&#39;s it! Enough of this crap!&quot;</p>
<p>Wonder if that whole &quot;warm milk&quot; thing does any good. I&#39;m so tired, but I can&#39;t sleep! :(</p>
