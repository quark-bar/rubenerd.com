<p>Reporting to you at the moment from the uni network because the internet at home is down… again!</p>

<p>Everything computer related is just going so fantastically for me!</p>
<p>I tell you what though, today is SO cold! The last week it&#39;s been in the high 30s, now it&#39;s late morning and the mercury hasn&#39;t risen to above 17 yet. I need a cuppa.</p>
