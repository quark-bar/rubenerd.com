<p>Just found myself at About.com through a Google search and was presented by this dialog box:</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/media.about.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>They say I need to update to the latest version of Safari. I&#39;m running the latest version of Safari, on the latest version of Mac OS X (10.4.5), on the latest version on Ruben&#39;s Brain.</p>
<p>Who coded this? :D</p>
