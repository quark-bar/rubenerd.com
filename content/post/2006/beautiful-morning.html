<p>In stark contrast to yesterday when insomnia ruined my whole day, today I had 9 hours of sleep, and woke up at 6:00am to a beautiful sunrise. The sky is very overcast and the mercury is sitting on about 12 degrees C, but the air is crisp and there are birds chirping in the trees. I&#39;m sitting here with my MacBook Pro looking out the opened window with a steaming cup of coffee, and life is great!</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#39;m just having a high in my biploar cycle, but whatever it is I&#39;m going to enjoy it while it lasts! I love this world!</p>
