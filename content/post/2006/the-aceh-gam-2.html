<p>I watched a fascinating and moving documentry on SBS about Aceh, the disputed state in nothern Sumatra, Indonesia. They were talking about GAM, or in English the Free Aceh Movement.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Free Aceh Movement (Indonesian: Gerakan Aceh Merdeka or simply GAM), also known as the Aceh Sumatra National Liberation Front (ASNLF), is a separatist group seeking independence for the Aceh region of Sumatra from Indonesia. The armed wing of the organisation has reportedly been dissolved following 2005 peace agreement with the Indonesian Government. The Indonesian government called the group the Aceh Security Disturbance Movement.</p>

<p>Those poor people, the civil wars, the struggle, then the tsunami to top it off.</p>
