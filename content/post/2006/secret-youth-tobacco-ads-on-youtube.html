<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/whiff-of-tobacco-firms-on-net/2006/11/17/1163266787563.html">The Sydney Morning Herald</a> website is reporting that <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a> has been flooded with videos depicting young people smoking. While there appears to be no direct evidence that these videos have been posted by tobacco companies, the speculation is there.</p>
<blockquote><p>IS THIS the last frontier in tobacco marketing or simply a global stage for the look-at-me generation?<br />
Thousands of videos of sexy, smoking teens are appearing on the internet phenomenon YouTube, possibly being posted by tobacco manufacturers to recruit the next generation of smokers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quite frankly I don&#39;t have a problem with cigarette advertising. The way I see it, with all the information and evidence available thesedays about how dangerous smoking is, if you&#39;re stupid enough to start the habit you deserve all the medical consequences. I like to think of it as natural selection at work ;). The only thing I resent is when our tax dollars have to pay for these people&#39;s self inflicted damage in hospitals.</p>
<p>Hey I just got the pun too: YouTube… cigarettes… cigarettes are tubes! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_internet_is_a_series_of_tubes">Just like the internet</a> ;).</p>
