<p>Tonight at 12:00 Kevin, Singapore Eugene, Chris, the three guys from Malaysia and I are off on a road trip to Melbourne, Canberra and Sydney for the easter holidays!</p>
<p>This means the next Rubenerd Show will be coming to you from one of these cities above, not Adelaide. I&#39;m not sure how easy I&#39;ll be able to access internet in the next week, so this also means the next episode will also be delayed a bit, so hang in there.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be talking to you guys soon.</p>
