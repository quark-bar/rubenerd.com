<p>Well the seller I sold (seller being sold something? Wonders never cease!) the iLife &#39;05 set to is coming over in just under 45 mins to pick it up. We figure cash in hand and pickup saves the trouble of crappy postal services and the evil black hole that is commercial banking.</p>
<p>I like the way Bob put it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Will pay cash when I pick it up &#8211; that way you get money straight away and we donâ€™t have to wait while it goes through banking blackhole from my account to yours &#8211; learnt the other day this was not instantaneous as one would expect &#8211; took over 24 hours or more.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And I thought I was the only one who had bad expereinces with this! I&#39;m not sure whether this is reassuring (ie: not just me) or disturbing!</p>
