<p>Can anyone make out what this message is supposed to be?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;One please.&#8221;</p>
<p>My friends call me ~The Powerhh0use~ I suppose<br />
due to my short height but big energy! I need<br />
someone that can match my enerrgy!</p>
<p>&#8220;Might I help you make up your mind?&#8221; the inspector asked, and pressed a button on the wall. The portal into outer blackness squealed open once again, and the robot grabbed Bill and started to push.</p>

<p>I did not edit ANY of this message! What&#39;s the point of cryptic spam? Isn&#39;t the whole point of spam to try to coax money out of me?</p>
