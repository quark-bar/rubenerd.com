<p>I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ve done, but I just posted my last entry and some of the style information has vanished! All the background colours, link-styles are gone,  but the sizes of all the elements and the locations of all the stuff are still intact.</p>
<p>Just typing this it&#39;s occured to me… in the Blix theme (and I&#39;m assuming most others; I&#39;m VERY new to WordPress!) the general page layout and the page colours etc are in two seperate CSS files, so perhaps the layout CSS is fine but the &#39;flavour&#39; CSS file isn&#39;t.</p>
<p>The question is though; why would the flavour CSS file get corrupted simply by posting an entry? This is probably my lack of WordPress experience speaking… but I&#39;m baffled.</p>
<p>Operation WTF has begun.</p>
