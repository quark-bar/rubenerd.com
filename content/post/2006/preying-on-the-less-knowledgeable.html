<p>The problem with all these services is that they prey on people who don&#39;t know much about internet security. You can &quot;mostly&quot; protect your computer with free services and software, you don&#39;t need to pay money to someone else.</p>
<p>Plus people who claim they can provide &quot;Total Internet Security&quot; are scammers. It&#39;s like a company saying their new miracle spray will prevent your car crashing, or a shipping line saying their ship is &quot;unsinkable&quot;.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;…If you really are concerned about privacy, the internet is a horrible place for you to hang out. There is no such thing as privacy on the internet and anyone who tries to assure you that they can cloak your activities is lying. If you’re really concerned, we suggest you stay off…&#8221; &#8211; Jim Kloss</p></blockquote>
<p>Ironically, this advertisement was on the same site that <a href="http://rubenerd.com/?p=187">claimed that left wing people are amoral</a>.</p>
