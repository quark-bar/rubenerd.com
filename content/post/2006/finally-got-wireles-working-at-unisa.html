<p>I think the AirPort card in my trusty-retro iBook G3 must have been stuffed, because I could never make a wireless connection at uni at all, but since getting this MacBook Pro I&#39;m on the internet typing this post as we speak from the library, fasctianting stuff!</p>
<p>The uni&#39;s policy is that while they <strong>allow</strong> the use of wireless networks on Mac OS X and Linux, they only <strong>support</strong> Windows 2000/XP. Charming.</p>
<p>Anyway there are a few quirks to get the wireless connection working at uni and their site only really details setting up in Windows, but I figured it out under Mac, so here&#39;s how to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open <strong>Internet Connect</strong>, choose <strong>AirPort</strong> from the toolbar</li>
<li>Connect to the UniSA network, no username/password required</li>
</ul>
<p>This will give you access to the uni network and the local intranet (such as uni email and course homepages) but if you want full internet access, you need to establish a VPN connection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open <strong>Internet Connect</strong> again, choose <strong>VPN</strong> from the toolbar</li>
<li>Choose the <strong>PPTP</strong> radio button</li>
<li>For <strong>Server Address</strong>, type 192.168.12.1</li>
<li>Type your UniSA username/password in the respective fields</li>
<li>Click <strong>Connect</strong></li>
<li>Close <strong>Internet Connect</strong>, open <strong>System Prefrences</strong></li>
<li>Choose <strong>Network</strong>, then double-click the new <strong>VPN (PPTP)</strong> connection</li>
<li>Click <strong>Proxies</strong>, then check the <strong>Web Proxy</strong> and <strong>Secure Web Proxy</strong></li>
<li>With each, type &#8220;www-proxy.unisa.edu.au&#8221; 8080</li>
<li>Click <strong>Apply Now</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Whew, done :).</p>
