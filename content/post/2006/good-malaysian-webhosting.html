<p>I guess two questions are coming up:</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why are you looking at webhosts when you have one already?</strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> Servage&#39;s upload and FTP speeds are HORRIBLE… which for podcasting and blogging is impossible!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Okay, so why a <em>Malaysian</em> webhost?</strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong> The rest of my nuclear family lives in Malaysia and if I was still in high school I would be there too. Plus South East Asians KNOW computers! Oh yeah, and the Ringgit exchange rate is VERY appealing!</p>
<p>So far <a href="http://exabytes.com.my">Exabytes</a> looks the best. 5GiB disk space, 50GiB of bandwidth… RM149 a year!</p>
