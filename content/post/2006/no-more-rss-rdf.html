<p><strong>UPDATE 2009:</strong> I changed my mind. Nuts to Atom, Iâ€™m stcking with RSS.</p>
<p>With all the different subscription links on the main page of Rubenerd I thought it was all a bit confusing; and redundant. With RDF and RSS 0.9x now depreciated and no longer in development, and with RSS 2.0 being frozen, Atom seems like the most logical next step, and every half-decent blog aggregator supports it now.</p>
<p>If by a WILD chance you&#39;re blog software <strong>doesn&#39;t</strong> support Atom feeds, you can still subscribe using the older style feeds below:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="//rubenerd.com/feed/"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/media.xml_rss2.png" alt="RSS 2.0 Feed"/></a></li>
<li><a href="//rubenerd.com/feed/"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/media.xml_rss092.png" alt="RSS 0.92 Feed"/></a></li>
<li><a href="//rubenerd.com/rdf/"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/media.xml_rdf.png" alt="Classic RDF Feed"/></a></li>
</ul>
<p>These feeds are kept up to date with the WordPress software, but I personally won&#39;t be checking them anymore.</p>
