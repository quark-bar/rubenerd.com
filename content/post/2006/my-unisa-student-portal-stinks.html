<p>Oh MyUniSA Student Portal, why do I hate thee? Let me count the ways.</p>
<h3>IMAP Microsoft Outlook for Student Email</h3>
<p>Whoever thought that was a good idea is insane. Not only does it limit native access to Windows users, but the web based Outlook is horrendously difficult to use, ugly and slower than molasses. And I don&#39;t care what anyone says, IMAP email that is stored on a remote server and has to be refreshed every time you do <strong>anything</strong> is not superior to POP/SMTP.</p>
<h3>MyUnisa Slow as Molasses</h3>
<p>Today to access the MyUniSA homepage after logging in took just under 2 minutes. On a weeknight it can be up to 7 minutes. This is unacceptable.</p>
<h3>Enrolment Still a Pain</h3>
<p>All the posters say that painful enrolment procedures are a thing of the past with their new internet enrolment system. Yeah, right. A counter-intuitive interface, the inability to see subjects as a grid before making final changes, and the dreaded &quot;This subject you&#39;ve chosen clashes with another you have already enrolled in&quot;. What a joke.</p>
<p>Believe me there&#39;s more, but I have real work to do now ;).</p>
