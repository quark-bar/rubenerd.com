<p>In one of my courses at uni I&#39;m learning object-oriented programming in C++. Coming from a VB, Perl, PHP, C background OOP is pretty difficult to fathem, let alone trying to learn C++ as well.</p>
<p>This website is the best I&#39;ve found so far to start you off on C++. It assumes basic programming knowledge, but is great for beginners. It had my back ;)</p>
