<p>The problem with these kinds of messages is not so much the fact that they&#39;re obviously fake and a scam, but in the way they&#39;re presented. They could net so many more &quot;clients&quot; if, oh I don&#39;t know, did a grammer and spell check, maybe make it look a touch more formal… why do they intentionally make their messages look rubbish? :D.</p>
<p>I guess the more unbelievable they are, the less people they&#39;re going to draw into their scams, which can only be a good thing! Shows though that the people doing these mass mailings are either pretty thick…  or script-kiddyish. Is kiddyish a word?</p>
