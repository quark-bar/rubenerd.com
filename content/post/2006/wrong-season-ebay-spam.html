<p><em>Ruben picks apart the useless spam he receives from the spamming spammers who spam him with their spammingly spammish spam. For all the spam he has picked apart, visit the <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/?cat=13">spam category</a>â€¦ sounds like a Monty Python routine.</em></p>
<p>Got this message from eBay a few days ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your registered name is included to show this message originated from eBay.</p>

<p>Come on peoples, I&#39;m in Australia right now (aka: Southern Hemisphere) where it is the dead of winter! And it wouldn&#39;t take much effort to see that I&#39;m registered with eBay Australia!</p>
<p>Not that I can stop this torrent of &quot;official&quot; spam from eBay, I&#39;ve visited ebay.com.au and &quot;unreigistered&quot; four times already without any success. Cheapskates.</p>
