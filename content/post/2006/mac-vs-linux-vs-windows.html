<p>Have been having an interesting discussion on the ONS forums about Mac versus Linux vs Windows… this is what a bloke called PaulV had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the PC has its advantages including but not limited to marketshare and the sheer quantity of software and the Mac has the user-friendly and admitedly better GUI, my friends, fancy polished software and beautiful interfaces can not match the raw computing power of a linux box.</p>
<p>I have used Macs for video and audio work, I use a PC for Pro/E and my Finite Element Analysis, but in all seriousness, when I want to compute the big numbers of Computational Fluid Dynamics the only economic viable solution is Linux.</p>
<p>The thing that I do not like about Macs is the nature of the closed architecture. I can’t go in and play around with hardware easily.</p>
<p>The thing I don’t like about Microsoft: Microsoft. And while XP and 2000 give hope that Vista, I pray will be a decently stable and useful OS, it’s expensive and patched together.</p>
<p>I’m not a real fan of either becuase their source codes are such closely gaurded secrets. You can’t really customize the inner workings of them.</p>
<p>Linux is open source which rocks. You can get the source code, make changes and create an entirely customized version of your OS to fit your needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And my reply to his post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I agree with some of what you said PaulV, the power of Linux part I have a differing opinion. Darwin is based on Mach and FreeBSD, which both I have found to be FAR more stable and powerful than any Linux distro. FreeBSD actually has roots in UNIX, Linux was written to behave like UNIX… *BSD rocks</p>
<p>Though I wholeheartedly agree with what you say about customisation, I love being able to whack together a Linux box with XFce, KOffice and Flock, it’s fast, reliable… though lately I’ve ditched Linux altogether and use DragonFlyBSD with XFce.</p>
<p>I gave OpenSolaris a go too recently, aside from the irritating hoops you have to go through to boot it with the original Solaris disc, it’s actually quite a compelling product: the basic command line utilities such as ls and mv seem to be much zippier, and apparently the whole TCP/IP stack was completely rewritten and is the most memory efficient of any *NIX, apparently to reduce the latency in data centres.</p>
<p>At the end of the day though, if I write a #/usr/bin/perl program, I can pretty much run it unmodified on Linux, Solaris, *BSD, Mac OS X/Darwin, MINIX, HP/UX (had a small amount of experience with) etc… but when I come to Windows… you get the point</p>
<p>And that’s what that’s all about :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d also point out that Macs being a &#8220;closed architecture&#8221; is such a tired old cliche. Just open a Terminal.</p>
