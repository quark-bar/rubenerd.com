<p>And Kerry&#39;s rebuttal:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;… The more vibrant the economy of a city/town, the more likely it is to knock down its old buildings because they are a poor economic use of space and the more likely it is to attract McDonalds and Starbucks. A stagnant economy is actually what allows our history and &#8220;culture&#8221; to survive.</p>
<p>I suspect you can assess the economy of a town by seeing what phase of &#8220;homogeneity&#8221; has been achieved. First test: does it have a Coles or Woolworths? Second test: does it have a McDonalds? Third test: does it have a Starbucks?</p>
<p>So, while we might despair about the rise of homogeneity and the loss of historic buildings, the simple economic reality is that every time we drive to a large modern supermarket with its satellite chain stores surrounded by a large carpark to do our shopping (which almost all of us do), we are driving another nail into the coffin of historic buildings and our unique culture.&#8221;<br />
