<p>If you haven&#39;t heard yet, Cyclone Larry has been tearing his way through northern Queensland, destroying property, flattening houses and causing widespread damage to farms: 95% of Australia&#39;s banana crop is gone and thousands have lost their jobs overnight. Reports are saying the winds have been reaching 290km/h.</p>
