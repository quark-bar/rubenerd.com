<p>Okay, I&#39;ve decided to take the plunge: I&#39;m going to learn <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>.</p>
<p>I must admit as a primarily <a href="http://perl.com/">Perl</a> programmer who grew up in primary school using Q-BASIC and Pascal (and was forced to use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/">Visual Basic</a> in high school) my mind seems to been hard-wired for event driven and sequential programming. though I think I have a rough grasp of object orientation. I like how elegantly you can create an object, assign properties and tell them to do things. I&#39;m less enthusiastic when it comes to polymorphism and all that rubbish, but I think that&#39;s largely due to my lack of experience!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve wanted to for ages to learn Ruby because it comes from Japan, and of course it sounds the same as my name ;).</p>
<p>I&#39;ll let you know how I go.</p>
