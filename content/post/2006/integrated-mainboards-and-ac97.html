<p>My family has several machines that I built myself that have cheaper integrated mainboards, aka the graphics and sounds are built on the board. If you&#39;re serious about gaming or any complex work these boards are a poor choice, especially if you want to be able to run the latest <a href="http://microsoft.com/windowsvista/">Microsoft ram-guzzling, graphics-card-frying, wallet-burning bug-fest</a>, but for my mum who uses her machine with <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu">Xubuntu Linux</a> for email and light web browsing they easily provide enough power, and you sure can&#39;t argue with the price.</p>
<p>One thing I always wondered though was: what is AC&#39;97? I knew it was the on board sound, but what did it actually stand for? As usual the almighty Wikipedia has the answer:</p>
<blockquote><p>AC’97 (short for Audio Codec ’97) is Intel Corporation’s Audio &#8220;Codec&#8221; standard developed by the Intel Architecture Labs in 1997, and used mainly in motherboards (also known as &#8216;on-board’ or &#8216;integrated’), modems, and sound cards.</p>
<p>Audio components integrated into Intel chipsets consists of 2 components &#8211; an AC’97 digital controller, which is built into the I/O Controller Hub (ICH) of the chipset, and an AC’97 codec, which is the analog component of the architecture. AC’97 defines a high-quality, 16- or 20-bit audio architecture for the PC that is used in the majority of today’s desktop platforms. AC’97 supports 96 kHz in 20-bit stereo resolution and 48 kHz in 20-bit stereo for multichannel recording and playback.</p></blockquote>
<p>There you have it. Don&#39;t say you never learn anything from this blog. Unless you knew that AC&#39;97 stuff already… if so just pretend to look surprised.</p>
