<p>So Marion in the sothern suburbs is getting a new multi-million dollar olympic-size swimming complex to foster a new generation of Olympic and Commonwealth games champions blah blah blah.</p>
<p>Good thing too, because all the other ones in Australia aren&#39;t here, and we have all this money and nothing to do with it…</p>
<ul>
<li>Poorly maintained roads</li>
<li>Lack of hospital beds for elective surgery</li>
<li>Lack of childcare facilities</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>
<p>But the richest part of all, the reporter for Channel 10 reporting the event said how he couldn&#39;t understand why some of the locals didn&#39;t like the idea. I mean, just because they didn&#39;t get consulted first even though they live there…</p>
<p>Hey, but at least we can swim.</p>
