<p>See it sounds all good, but my bullshit detector is just going crazy. And why would I give personal details to someone that I have never met, have never been in contact with or even know exists?</p>
<p>With this sort of spam I like to reply using a different address and play along with them for fun until they ask for money, then I start making excuses about how &quot;oh, to do a money transfer I need <em>you</em> to send money first… or why can&#39;t you just use some of my winnings to pay for it first?&quot;. That usually lets them know I&#39;m onto their B.S., and no I&#39;m not referring to a Bachellor of Science (which I&#39;m currently doing myself).</p>
