<p>So I&#39;m sitting here watching television with my parents here in KL. We&#39;ve got cable here which is refeshing after coping with public access television in Australia (okay, it&#39;s only Channel 10 that I have an issue with, but you get the idea).</p>
<p>One problem though, my mum just channel surfed and skipped what looked liked a fascinating documentary about how they built the Petronas Twin Towers here in KL, and a show about the composition of comets and how our solar system formed, to instead watching a show about sea horses.</p>
<p>I guess you can&#39;t win them all :(.</p>
