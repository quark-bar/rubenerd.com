<p>I&#39;ve been looking around for a small, lightweight Bittorrent client for Mac OS X. So far I used the vanilla Bittorrent client and <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net/">Azureus</a> on the Mac and was fairly impressed, but the vanilla client was pretty… vanilla, and Azureus uses so many system resources! I guess because it&#39;s Java and not a true Cocoa program.</p>
<p>I tried Transmission (<a href="http://transmission.m0k.org/">http://transmission.m0k.org/</a>) and was really impressed. It&#39;s only 300 kilobytes in size (VERY refreshing after downloading Azureus!) and because it&#39;s a native Cocoa.app it works brilliantly, even on my ageing iBook G3 machine.</p>
<p>Plus I can also use it on my XFce DragonFlyBSD machine with the Linux version too, both are VERY polished programs!</p>
<p>And if you&#39;re a Windows user and want to give it a go… GET A REAL OPERATING SYSTEM! :D.</p>
<p>Below are some screenshots; I&#39;ve uploaded them onto my server so I&#39;m not leeching their bandwidth, so check out <a href="http://transmission.m0k.org/screenshots.php">http://transmission.m0k.org/screenshots.php</a> for updates. I don&#39;t think I need to tell you which one is running on Mac and which is on Linux ;)</p>
