<p>So I was looking for a picture of the Enterprise from Star Trek on Google Images when instead this picture of a retro computer came up: the Enterprise 64.</p>
<p>Now because my dad was working on IBMs at work since the early 1980s all of our computers at home were IBMs (and later compatibles) until I moved to Apple in 1999 when the Windows crashes were starting to affect my ability to maintain my sanity. Yes I know the latest Apples are x86s. Anyway the reason why I say this is because from the beginning we had IBMs at home, no Amigas, no Commodores… we were business machines all the way.</p>
<p>I had never even heard of the Enterprise 64 or 128 until I saw the image on Google Images. It was in Spanish so I went over the the venerable <a href="http://www.homecomputer.de/pages/f_info.html?Enterprise_64.html">Home Computer Museum</a> (English version) and came up with the machine&#39; vitals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Country:</strong> UK</li>
<li><strong>Most Common:</strong> UK, Hungary</li>
<li><strong>Rarity (Euro):</strong> very rare</li>
<li><strong>Year:</strong> 1985</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Zilog Z80</li>
<li><strong>RAM / ROM:</strong> 64 kB / 32 kB</li>
<li><strong>Colours:</strong> 256</li>
<li><strong>Comment:</strong> Also known as Mephisto PHC 64 in Germany</li>
</ul>
<p>If it had a Zilog Z80 chip, was it capable of running CP/M? That would be wicked!</p>
<p>Reading a bit further I found out one of the defining features of this machine was the abnormally large number of expansion ports. To save costs the ports weren&#39;t actually sockets, but rather just exposed parts of the mainboard with gold contacts.</p>
<p>You can see diagrams of the ports at <a href="http://www.museo8bits.com/enterpri.htm">Museo8Bits</a>, as well as the original advertising for the machine:</p>

<p>Blast from the past! I&#39;m off to dust off the Commodore 64c from the storeroom… from eBay a few years back!</p>
