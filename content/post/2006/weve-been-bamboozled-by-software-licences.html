<p>If you purchase a software product, you are entitled to do a lot more than what Microsoft would like you to. Their &quot;End User Licence Agreement&quot; or EULA, says you&#39;re not allowed to reverse engineer the software, modify it etc, but under most legal codes this is not enforacble as it is not backed up by law.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the United States, once you own a copy of a program, you can back it up, compile it, run it, and even modify it as necessary, without permission from the copyright holder.</p>
<p>Microsoft puts a &#8220;license&#8221; on all of its software and pretends that you don’t have the right to use the software unless you agree to the &#8220;license.&#8221; You can’t patch Windows without their permission, according to the license; you can’t use NT Workstation for more than 10 simultaneous connections; you must give Microsoft your first-born son. (Or something like that.)</p>
<p>The problem with Microsoft’s license is that it’s unenforceable. You can simply ignore it. Microsoft can’t win a copyright infringement lawsuit: you own the software that Microsoft sold you, and Congress gave you the right to use it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fascinating! Apparently the European Union also has a similar legal situation:</p>
<blockquote><p>The European Software Directive (adopted by the UK in 1992) gives users the freedom to copy, run, modify, and reverse-engineer lawfully acquired programs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Be interesting to see where Australia and Singapore / ASEAN fit into this.</p>
