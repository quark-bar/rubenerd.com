<p>I had no idea as to the existance of this command, but as I was searching through my <code>/usr/bin/</code> directory trying to see what version of Perl I had, I saw the <code>nice</code> command.</p>
<p>Typing <code>man nice</code> gave:</p>
<blockquote><p>NAME<br />
     nice &#8212; execute a utility with an altered scheduling priority</p>
<p>SYNOPSIS<br />
     nice [-n increment] utility [argument â€¦]</p>
<p>DESCRIPTION<br />
     nice runs utility at an altered scheduling priority.  If an increment is<br />
     given, it is used; otherwise an increment of 10 is assumed.  The super-<br />
     user can run utilities with priorities higher than normal by using a neg-<br />
     ative increment.  The priority can be adjusted over a range of -20 (the<br />
     highest) to 20 (the lowest).</p>
<p>     Available options:</p>
<p>     -n increment<br />
             A positive or negative decimal integer used to modify the system<br />
             scheduling priority of utility.</p>
<p>DIAGNOSTICS<br />
     The nice utility shall exit with one of the following values:</p>
<p>     1-125   An error occurred in the nice utility.</p>
<p>     126     The utility was found but could not be invoked.</p>
<p>     127     The utility could not be found.</p>
<p>     Otherwise, the exit status of nice shall be that of utility.</p>
<p>COMPATIBILITY<br />
     The historic -increment option has been deprecated but is still supported<br />
     in this implementation.</p>
<p>SEE ALSO<br />
     csh(1), getpriority(2), setpriority(2), renice(8)</p>
<p>STANDARDS<br />
     The nice utility conforms to IEEE Std 1003.2-1992 (&#8220;POSIX.2&#8221;).</p>
<p>HISTORY<br />
     A nice utility appeared in Version 6 AT&#038;T UNIX.</p>
<p>BUGS<br />
     nice is built into csh(1) with a slightly different syntax than described<br />
     here.  The form `nice +10&#8242; nices to positive nice, and `nice -10&#8242; can be<br />
     used by the super-user to give a process more of the processor.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As a long time previous DOS/Windows user that moved to Mac and BSD back in 2002, I guess its like assigning priority in the Task Manager in NT/2000/XP/2003?</p>
<p>Who cares, I can say UNIX is being nice :)</p>
