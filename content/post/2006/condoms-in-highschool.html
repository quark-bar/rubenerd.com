<p>Just finished watching Dr Phil while doing my C++ (lets face it, Dr Phil isn&#39;t exactly something you need to give your 100% attention to get!) and they were discussing whether condoms should be given out in highschools or not.</p>
<p>Heh, reminds me of all the hundreds of mock debates in English classes ;).</p>
<p>Anyway I&#39;ve always held the view that condoms should be available in schools. I say to people who claim that having condoms in highschool will promote sexual activity and that by teaching abstinence instead will erase these evil thoughts in teenagers&#39; headsâ€¦ stop being so naive!!!!!! Teenagers are teenagers and will do what teenagers do.</p>
<p>Welcome to the real world.</p>
