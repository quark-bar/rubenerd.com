<p>By using the <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/developers/downloads/jde/index.shtml">BlackBerry Java Development Environment</a> you can simulate a BlackBerry device on your Windows machine:</p>
<blockquote><p>The BlackBerry® Java™ Development Environment (JDE) is a fully integrated development environment and <strong>simulation tool</strong> for building Java 2, Micro Edition (J2ME™) applications for Java-based BlackBerry devices.</p>
<p>It is a Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP) compliant J2ME environment for developers who wish to maintain seamless portability in their wireless applications. In addition, the BlackBerry JDE provides a full suite of interfaces and utilities to take advantage of some of the unique features of the BlackBerry device.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mac or *BSD version anyone? :(</p>
