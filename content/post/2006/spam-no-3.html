<p>About 2 years ago now I downloaded <a href="http://picasa.com/">Picasa</a> which, when I tested it and found it out to be a cheap knockoff of iPhoto, I deleted it. Since then I don&#39;t even have a Windows machine anymore.</p>
<p>Yet I still get weekly &quot;newsletters&quot; from them. Why whenever I download stuff like this and have to provide an address do they automatically assume I&#39;d be interested in their junk every single week?</p>
<p>Anyway they had an unsubscribe link, and you know they usually say it&#39;ll take 24 to 48 hours before it comes into effect and you stop receiving messages? Well look at what Picasa says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please enter your email address below and click &#8220;Remove&#8221; to confirm your request to be removed from this mailing list. It will take up to <strong>10 days</strong> for your request to take effect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>10 DAYS? What justification could they possibly give for that?!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Picasa user,<br />
The monkey we hired to help us with our newsletter referrels has come down with measels and has to go back to Taronga Zoo for 10 days. Thank you for your patience.</p>
