<p>Another update from Israel in Japan:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I went to Tôkyô yesterday (Saturday) and became very lost. I think I achieved my objectives, but I don’t have any pictures (for various reasons) to prove it to myself or others.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the time I spent wandering the streets around Shibuya. I accidentally found (I think) Hikawa Jinja when I had given up and decided to try to find my way back to the train station and then I got lost trying to do that.</p>
<p>I’m going again tomorrow because I am very tired today.</p>

<p>He&#39;s posted some images from his train journey and an audio clip; check out <a href="http://s7.invisionfree.com/The_Overnightscape/index.php?showtopic=646&amp;st=0&amp;#last">The Overnightscape forum</a> for details…</p>
