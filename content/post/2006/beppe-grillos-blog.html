<p>Now this blog is interesting! It appears to be an Italian political site, but it does have an English version as well for those of us who&#39;s grasp of Italian hinges on our knowlege of food.</p>
<blockquote><p>
We discuss: Citizen Primaries, Ecology, Economics, Energy, Health/Medicine, Information, Modern Slaves, Politics, Technology/Internet, Transport/Getting About, Wailing Wall
</p></blockquote>
<p>While I don&#39;t entirely agree with some of the posts, it still makes for very interesting reading on global affairs, especially from an Italian perspective!</p>
