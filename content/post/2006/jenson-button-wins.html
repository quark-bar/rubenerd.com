<p>Less than 15 minutes ago, Jenson Button has won the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix, his first Grand Prix victory in over 100 races! Good on you Button, we knew you could do it! Congratulations also to Honda F1 racing, with Rubens Barrichello also receiving points on the scoreboard they must be feeling pretty damned good right now!</p>
<p>The race was pretty amazing tonight, I&#39;m interested to see how the authorities react to Michael&#39;s corner cutting too. Pretty eventful stuff!</p>
