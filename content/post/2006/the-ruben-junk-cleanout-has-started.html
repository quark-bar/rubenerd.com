<p><strong>The Ruben Junk Cleanout Has Started!</strong><br />
The aim? To get rid of… HALF of my junk. HALF! Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>So I don&#39;t have to ask my parents for money, my mum&#39;s treatment is costing enough as it is without me</li>
<li>I have too much stuff</li>
<li>I should be able to move house all the time (being a uni student)</li>
</ul>
<p>I figure it&#39;s the same as <a href="http://crapandstuff.com/pictures-2004-2005cleaning-stage1.html">Israel Brown&#39;s Big Cleanout</a>.</p>
