<p>I was unaware of the existence of <em>Adobe &quot;Premierer&quot;</em> or <em>Windows XP &quot;Prom&quot;</em>… believe me my prom/formal was bad enough, don&#39;t remind me!</p>
<p>If you want to be taken seriously, for Pete&#39;s sake do a spell check! We&#39;re not talking rocket science!</p>
<p><strong>Afterthought:</strong> I was going to also say something cynical about how Windows and Office are being offered for $99.95 when FreeBSD + OpenOffice is $0.00 but I&#39;ll let it slide for now ;).</p>
