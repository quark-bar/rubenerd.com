<p>You may have <a href="//rubenerd.com/we-have-internet-and-telephone-again/">read a few days ago</a> that our telephones were stuffing up around Gita Bayu and therefore so was our DSL: well would you believeâ€¦ it intermittently happened over and over again these last few days. I&#39;ve got Nelly and Tim McGraw singing &quot;Over and Over Again&quot; in my head as I type this. Argh I hate hip hop! There&#39;s usually enough time to post a few things to my <a href="http://del.icio.us/rubenerd/">del.icio.us</a> page and to read my email but it cuts out and resets so often it&#39;s been driving me to insanity!</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t upload <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">Rubenerd Shows</a> because they would cut out after the first 2 megs, so I&#39;ve resorted to going all the way into the city to upload these shows. The WiFi here at the <a href="http://coffeebean.com.my">Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf</a> is a bit unreliable but much, MUCH better than at home.</p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking of a drastic way to rescue the show and bring it back to a regular schedule, it has to do with the way WordPress can submit posts with a time delay and recording shows a week in advance, but I&#39;ll discuss that in more detail next episode. Hopefully this way if there are delays the show will continue uninterrupted; the only downside I see with this is that I won&#39;t be able to talk about current events as easily.</p>
<p>Damn the monsoon season!</p>
