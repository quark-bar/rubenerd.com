<p>The <a href="http://ruben.sg/">University Chronicles of Ruben</a> has been launched!</p>
<blockquote><p>…[this blog] is designed purely for detailing my university work, mostly to keep track of it myself. If you’re out looking for ripping yarns, witty banter or <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/?p=182">cheap shots at John Howard</a>, you will not find them here.</p>
<p>I also don’t intend to post to this every day, only when I am in the middle of a university assignment, work project or similar undertaking. I’m finding uni difficult not just due to the workload and increasing complexity of the material, but also purely from an organisation point of view. It is my hope I can use this blog to help with this.</p></blockquote>
<p>So if Computer Science or Economics are your thing, check it out if you want :).</p>
