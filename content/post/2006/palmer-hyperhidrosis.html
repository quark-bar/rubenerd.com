<p>For as long as I can remember I&#39;ve had sweaty hands. I&#39;m not talking about if I&#39;m exercising, or meeting someone you have a crush on sort of sweaty handsâ€¦ I have sweaty hands CONSTANTLY, and my dad does to; so I thought it was just a freak genetic disorder.</p>
<p>It&#39;s horrible, I literally have to have a small fan next to my computer keyboard and mouse to keep my hands (sort of) dry, and even then they&#39;re still damp!!! And it really screws up my self esteem; whenever I shake hands with anyone it&#39;s so embarrasing.</p>
<p>Well I finally found out what it&#39;s called, and apparently it&#39;s treatable :D :D :D</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Palmar hyperhidrosis is a condition marked by excessive perspiration of the palms beyond physiological necessity. It is caused by hyperactivity of the sweat glands in the sympathetic nervous system. Palmar hyperhidrosis is a hereditary sweating disorder, which often begins during childhood with no known cause.</p>
<p>Because palmer hyperhidrosis is aggravated by stress as minor as shaking or holding hands, it has significant social and psychological impact on patients afflicted with this disorder.</p>
<p>People with palmer hyperhidrosis disorder are in constant awareness of their condition and they have to live with it. For this reason, most hyperhidrosis sufferers go to great lengths to avoid contacts with others by hiding their hands in their pockets or under their arms. They may lose confidence in their ability to socialize or interact with others and as a result may become frustrated and withdrawn.</p>
<p><strong>Cure For Sweaty Hands</strong></p>
<p>Common form of treatments is available for palmer hyperhidrosis or excessive sweaty hands. The mild forms of palmer hyperhidrosis or excessive sweaty hands respond well to oral medications such as Drysol or even baby powder. Minimally invasive surgical treatment of palmer hyperhidrosis is reserved for severe or massive palmer hyperhidrosis. The treatment is called thoracoscopic sympathectomy.</p>
