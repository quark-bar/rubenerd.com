<p>If you&#39;re trying to burn a data DVD or CD in Mac OS X Tiger (<em>or later, see the comments for this post!</em>) and you get the following error when you insert a blank disc:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family:monospace"><p><code>0x8002002</pre>
<p>… the Finder might be having a caching issue and forgetting a drive is attached, according to <a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://www.frozennorth.org/C2011481421/E1617705938/">FrozenNorth</a>. Fortunately there is an easy enough solution: eject the offending disc, Force Quit the Finder then try again.</p>
<p>For those who don&#39;t know how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the Apple Menu in to top left hand corner</li>
<li>Click &quot;<span style="font-family:monospace">Force Quit…</span>&quot;</li>
<li>Choose &quot;<span style="font-family:monospace">Finder</span>&quot; from the list, then click &quot;<span style="font-family:monospace">Restart</span>&quot;</li>
<li>Eject the blank disc, then reinsert and try burning again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively you can do it from the Terminal:</p>
<blockquote style="font-family:monospace"><p>$ killall Finder</p></blockquote>
<p>Surprisngly enough, this is the #1 result for doing searches on this topic in Google, for some reason. That surprises me no end, though perhaps its a sign this issue isn&#39;t very widespread. Unfortunately, that also means it may be sticking around for a while. Here&#39;s hoping it&#39;s fixed in the next release of OS X. </p>
<p>In the meantime, hope this was useful!</p>
