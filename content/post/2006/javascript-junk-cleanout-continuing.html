<p>My third auction sellingâ€¦ this time I parted with a copy of JavaScript for Dummies:</p>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/media.ef_1_b.JPG.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>I bought this book while I was working for Peter at Veritas DGC in Singapore, but in the last few months all the effects on my website I&#39;ve been able to accomplish using Perl/CGI and some basic CSS, which I think is more accessible than JavaScript. JavaScript has a place in more complex or important projects, but not in a funny webpage like mine ;).</p>

<p>So far I&#39;ve been pleased with my eBay auctions, I&#39;ve been cleaning out my stuff while at the same time making a few quid too, I think it&#39;s so far been a worthwhile exercise.</p>
