<p>As most people in Australia would probably know by now Yahoo! Australia and the 7 network merged their sites into one portal. At first I shrugged at the news, gave it the &quot;who really cares&quot; routine and left it.</p>

<p>I checked it out today though and was pleasently surprised. The layout and design of the front page is supurb, it&#39;s much easier to find information. Plus I know that Channel 9 and MSN are having a fling, and we all know MSN is evil, so I&#39;m glad that 7 chose a much less evil partner! And we all know that Sunrise show on 7 is so much better than the Today show on 9 ;).</p>
<p>You can still reach it at <a href="http://yahoo.com.au/">http://yahoo.com.au/</a>, or their new address at <a href="http://yahoo7.com/">http://yahoo7.com/</a> (they both still redirect you to <a href="http://au.yahoo.com/">http://au.yahoo.com/</a>).</p>
<p>My rating? 4 stars.</p>
