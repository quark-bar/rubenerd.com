<p>While I was looking for a picture for the XBox post below I saw the latest reincarnation of Techmo&#39;s Dead or Alive fighting game series, I think they&#39;re up to version 920 or something.</p>

<p>I know anime computer games don&#39;t exactly adhere to any laws of physics, but how can you fight people when you&#39;re wearing high heels? Most people have enough difficulty just walking in them! :D. Not that I would know personally…</p>
<p>Reminds me of what my sister used to say about PS Sailor Moon: &quot;you can&#39;t fight evil in high heels!&quot;</p>
