<p>Are you a smoker, do you have a weblog, and are fed up with being an idiot?</p>

<p>It puts a little counter on your page that keeps track of how long since you brought back your intelligence (how long you&#39;ve quit for), how many ciggies you&#39;ve saved the people around you from inhaling (yes some us don&#39;t want your filth) and the amount of money you&#39;ve saved in doing so which could go to other worthwhile causes, such as buying litres of coffee :D.</p>
<p>I would put my own quit counter on here, but I was never stupid enough to start in the first place.</p>
