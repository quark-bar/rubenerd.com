<p>I&#39;ve recently brought back a Blue and White Apple Power Macintosh G3 to life, and I was going to put a flavour of BSD on there (instinctively), but I changed my mind and decided to dump Mac OS 9 on there, for nostaligic reasons ;).</p>
<p>Anyway finding a basic web browser that&#39;s still being compiled for that OS is a real challenge, but some digging around did produce some links:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.wamcom.org/latest-131/">WaMCom</a><br />
This is the 2003-07-21 release of WaMCom, the Web and Mail Communicator.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/macbrowsers.html">Unicode in Mac Browsers</a></p>
<p>Information regarding unicode support in Mac OS 9 browsers; itâ€™s actually very useful simply because it lists all the browsers!</p></blockquote>
<p>More when I find them.</p>
