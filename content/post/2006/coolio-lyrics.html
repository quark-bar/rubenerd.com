<p>Coolio is awesome, he&#39;s music is like some sort of <em>good</em> rap!</p>
<p>&quot;See You When You Get There&quot; (1997) actually has some pretty deep lyricsâ€¦ especially for a rap song!</p>
<p>Verse 3 Lyrics:</p>
<blockquote><p>The realest homies that youve been knowing for the longest<br />
But some aint missing a good thing until its gone<br />
Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us<br />
We prefer to keep our eyes shut to describe when<br />
Its something wrong and we desire<br />
So hold your head up high if your poor and righteous<br />
I know time seems right<br />
And the problems seem endless<br />
But at times of despair we gotta pull ourselves together<br />
And if you fell youre out the game then you need to get back in it<br />
Coz nothing worse than a quitter<br />
You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother<br />
So gather up your pity and turn it to ambition<br />
And put your vehicle and drive and stop by my side</p></blockquote>
