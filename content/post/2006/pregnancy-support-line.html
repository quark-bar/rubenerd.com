<p>The Liberal Party in Australia is planning to set up a &#39;pregnancy support line&#39; to reduce Australia&#39;s abortion rate, which apparently is very high by industralised standards.</p>
<p>But here&#39;s the catch: the support line will be outsourced to, amongst others, religious organisations, and NOT to pro-choice organisations. The plot thickens.</p>
<p>So Tony Abbott couldn&#39;t hold on to control of the RU486 pill, so instead he&#39;ll brainwash vunerable people who call a supposed &#39;neutral pregnancy support line&#39;.</p>
<p>Conservativesâ€¦</p>
