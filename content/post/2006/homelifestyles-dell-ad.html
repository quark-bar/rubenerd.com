<p>So I was just watching Home.Life.Style (Australian Home Lifestyle show.. I know I surprise even myself) while doing my economics homework, and the lead presenter starting taking about the Dell Inspiron xxxx.</p>
<p>She said it was so great for watching DVDs, it had a HUGE 40GB hard drive (what time period is she from?), plenty of RAM with 256MB, and Windows XP.</p>
<p>Since when is a 40GB hard drive HUGE for a laptop? And since when does Windows XP run fine with only 256MB of RAM? I know this is a Dell we&#39;re talking about, but even this is pretty slack.</p>
<p>Conveniently she didn&#39;t mention that appauling technical support, their slow response times to support questions, the &quot;shoddiness&quot; of their machines&#39; construction, their limited lifetimes and the fact you&#39;re stuck with using the most unreliable, buggy and insecure operating system with it to boot.</p>
<p>Sure it&#39;s $1400. But surely your sanity and work performance are worth more!</p>
