<p>Anyway, I didn&#39;t know this, but did you know if you chop onion with a SHARP knife (as opposed to a dumb knife… har har) you won&#39;t get anywhere near the amount of stinging in your eyes? With a blunt knife you break a lot more cell walls which releases more of the vapour which, when mixed with the fluid in your eyes creates a mild acid… ouch!</p>
<p>And some tips for making great baked vegetables:</p>
<ul>
<li>When baking potato/onion etc, chop them up into similar sizes, so when they bake they all cook evenly</li>
<li>Add light amount of oil and seasoning before putting them in</li>
<li>Don&#39;t stack the veggies on top of each other, or they&#39;ll stew and go yucky</li>
</ul>
<p>You learn something new each… week.</p>
