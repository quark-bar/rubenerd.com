<blockquote><p>She caught the katy<br />
And left me a mule to ride<br />
She caught the katy<br />
And left me a mule to ride<br />
Now my baby caught the katy<br />
Left me a mule to ride<br />
The train pulled out<br />
I swung on behind<br />
Crazy bout her<br />
That hard headed woman of mine</p>
<p>Man, my baby’s long<br />
Great gosh almighty my baby’s tall<br />
You know my babys long<br />
Great gosh almighty my baby’s tall<br />
Yeah my baby shes long<br />
My baby shes tall<br />
Shes sleepin with her head in the kitchen<br />
And her feets out in the hall<br />
Crazy bout her<br />
That hard headed woman of mine</p>
<p>Well I love my baby<br />
Shes so fine<br />
But I wish shed come and see me some time<br />
She dont believe in our love, ah<br />
Look whatta hole Im in<br />
She dont believe what Im sayin<br />
Kid look whatta shape Im in<br />
Huh-huh</p>
<p>She caught the katy<br />
And left me a mule to ride<br />
She caught the katy<br />
And left me a mule to ride<br />
Well my baby caught the katy<br />
Left me a mule to ride<br />
The train pulled out<br />
I swung on behind<br />
Crazy bout that hard headed woman<br />
Hard headed woman of mine<br />
Huh-huh, huh-huh</p></blockquote>
