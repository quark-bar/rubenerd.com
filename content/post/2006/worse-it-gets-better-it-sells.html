<p>Interesting article on the sorry state of the music industry today and how all an artist has to do is say hoe or slut to sell a song. Where&#39;d all the Jazz go?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the wild success of artists like Ludacris, Nelly, Chingy and Beyoncé, for the first time in the 50-year history of the Billboard charts, black artists dominated the top 10 earlier this month, signalling hip-hop’s ascent as the driving force in pop music and culture.</p>
<p>The multi-billion dollar hip-hop industry, whose effects are felt across the board from fashion to advertising to slang, is under a lot more scrutiny lately because of its monstrous commercial appeal. It’s everywhere. Ludacris, Eminem, Jay-Z and Beyoncé are in movies and plug their own clothing lines while Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera have revamped their pop profiles with the help of hip-hop staples the Neptunes and Redman, and get downright &#8220;Dirrty&#8221; in videos.</p>
<p>So it’s not what’s on Billboard’s top 10 charts that’s amazing these days, but what’s actually still in it.</p>

<p>The only problem with this article: it makes the assumption that Hip Hop and Rap are actually music!</p>
