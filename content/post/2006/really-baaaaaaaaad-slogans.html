<p>Well I&#39;m sitting here for the start of the first lecture of the year for &quot;Object Oriented System Development&quot;, looks absolutely riveting.</p>
<p>There are all these posters lining the sides of the hall, the slogans are pretty bad!</p>
<ul>
<li>UniSA Mathematics Programs &#8211; Be cool and calculating</li>
<li>UniSA IT Programs &#8211; Control Alt Enter</li>
</ul>
<p>This is going to be a long two hours!</p>
<p>Wait a tic, they&#39;ve changed the name &quot;Object Oriented System Development&quot; to &quot;Object Oriented Software Engineering&quot;. Sounds sexier.</p>
