<p>I know it may sound weird, but I have always had a fascination with abandoned buildings, in particular with ones built in the last few decades. There&#39;s something about seeing a gigantic modern structure &#8211; a shopping centre, a hotel, an apartment complex &#8211; which no doubt had thousands go through them every day, just sit there idle slowly falling into disrepair and nature taking back. I see abandoned buildings in the same way marine archaeoligists may see a sunken vessel: like a window to another time that you can experience. Fascinating stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway I was doing some research into the Kowloon Walled City in Hong Kong for Episode 70 of the <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">Rubenerd Show</a> and came across this mysterious site: all it has is the word <strong>&quot;Colors&quot;</strong> (American spelling), the phrase <strong>&quot;Gunkanjima Index Vol One&quot;</strong>, and stacks of thumbnails.</p>
<p>Check it out if you&#39;re into this sort of thing, it&#39;s pretty fascinating:</p>
