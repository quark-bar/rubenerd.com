<p><em>Ruben picks apart the useless spam he receives from the spamming spammers who spam him with their spammingly spammish spam.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>
University Degree</p>
<p>OBTAIN A PROSPEROUS FUTURE, MONEY-EARNING POWER,<br />
AND THE PRESTIGE THAT COMES WITH HAVING THE CAREER POSITION YOU’VE<br />
ALWAYS DREAMED OF. DIPLOMA FROM<br />
PRESTIGIOUS NON-ACCREDITED<br />
<strong>UNVERSITIES</strong> BASED ON YOUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE AND PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE.<br />
If you qualify, no required tests, classes, books or examinations.</p>
<p>Confidentiality Assured</p>
<p>1-334-xxx-xxxx<br />
24 hours a day, 7 days a week including Sundays and Holidays

<p>An advertisement for a university that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delivered through unwanted junk mail</li>
<li>Makes no reference to the &#8220;university&#8221; in question</li>
<li>Makes no reference to where the &#8220;university&#8221; is</li>
<li>Contains a spelling mistake</li>
<li>Assures confidentiality when confidentiality has been breached to bring this message to me</li>
<li>CAPITAL LETTERS DO NOT LOOK SMART</li>
</ul>
<p>Professionalism? Guess these guys didn&#39;t go to university… or primary school.</p>
