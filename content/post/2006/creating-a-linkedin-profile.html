<p>I just found today a great site called <a href="http://linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> which is described as a &quot;business oriented social networking site&quot;.</p>
<p>It&#39;s still at a very rudementary stage but you can view mine profile at <a href="http://linkedin.com/in/schade/">http://linkedin.com/in/schade/</a>. Was very lucky to have my last name thereâ€¦ as long as a German doesn&#39;t see it ;).</p>
<p>You can connect with contacts, colleagues and classmates as well as advertise your own expertise which is invaluable for consultants; more often than not I think finding the clients is almost as challenging as actually undertaking the work.</p>
