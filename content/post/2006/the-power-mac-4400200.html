<p>With all the talk recently that Windows XP has been hacked onto the MacBook Pro and the 17 inch iMac, apparently an older generation Mac <strong>could</strong> run Windows/DOS:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Apple Power Macintosh 4400/200 (PC), based on the Tanzania architecture co-developed by Apple and Motorola, features a 200 MHz PowerPC 603e processor, 16 or 32 MB of RAM, and a 1.2 GB or 2.0 GB hard drive in an industry-standard desktop case. The 4400 series is unique because it is the first Apple Mac to use primarily industry-standard parts to keep the price low. The PC-Compatible version ships with a 166 MHz Cyrix 6&#215;86 processor card that can have up to 80 MB of RAM dedicated to the DOS/Windows operating system.</p>
