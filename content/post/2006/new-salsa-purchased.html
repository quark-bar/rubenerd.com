<p>This must be one of the worst pair of blog posts ever typed.</p>
<p>Eh, except for all of those:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;okay like today i woke up and had XYZ for breakfast then i went to school it was fun  but the teacher was boring at lunch the guy who is tooooooooooootalyyy hot asked me 2 pass the kechap and i was all like sure and he was all like date and i was all like f*ck off hehehehe !!!!!!!!!!!111!!!1!1&#8243;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway, the bastard who stole my salsa never admitted (cowardly actâ€¦) so I was forced to buy a new one.</p>

<p>And if you even think for a second that you&#39;re going to steal it, <strong>I&#39;ll steal you!</strong>.</p>
<p>Didn&#39;t make sense I know, but it sounds all macho. Hah, what would I know about macho?</p>
