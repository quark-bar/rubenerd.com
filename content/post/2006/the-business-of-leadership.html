<blockquote><p><img src="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/media.philgnewheadshot.jpg" alt="Phil Gerbyshak" /></p>
<p>Great question posed by Rocky Noe today: &#8220;What really makes people better leaders?&#8221; I donâ€™t have the &#8220;perfect&#8221; answer, I do know that for me, a great leader is willing to do what others will not, for no reason other than that they need to be done.</p></blockquote>
