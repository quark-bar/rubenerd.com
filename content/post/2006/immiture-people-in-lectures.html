<p>Okay, I&#39;ve been in this lecture for a while now, and there are two girls in front are so damned immiture it&#39;s not funny. Seriously.</p>
<p>This is what she has laughed at during the last half hour:</p>
<ul>
<li>lecturer&#39;s phone buzzed</li>
<li>name lecturer mentioned had &quot;ooz&quot; in it</li>
<li>lecturer&#39;s microphone made a brief fart sound</li>
<li>lecturer says to read &quot;Larman&quot; textbook</li>
<li>lecturer says &quot;I deleted the originals&quot;</li>
<li>lecturer says &quot;theres a zip fileâ€¦ somewhere&quot;</li>
<li>lecturer says &quot;go to the forum and post&quot;</li>
<li>lecturer says &quot;I dont go to pieces if I dont answer something&quot;</li>
<li>lecturer says &quot;for dice game you have a die&quot;</li>
<li>lecturer&#39;s phone rang</li>
</ul>
<p>Quote on guy&#39;s book next to me: I&#39;m not alone, I&#39;m with myself &#8211; Jane Fonder</p>
<p>Well would you look at that, Mrs Mature has started doodling flowers, hearts, barbed wire, &quot;this subject sux&quot; words on her book, this is so cliche its painful. And laughing at little kiddy things. And taking about how she got drunk on Saturday night.</p>
