<p>I just want to say that Rob Kerin&#39;s defeat speech was very noble and I have a lot of respect for him.</p>
<p>Some of the Liberal ministers who lost their electorates make my blood boil though. Just watching the news, two of them have said that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Labor didn&#39;t deserve the win and</li>
<li>the voters were conned by the Labor government and that the voters unfortunately bought Labor&#39;s crap</li>
</ul>
<p>For Pete&#39;s sake, shut up. You lost the election, the people were disenchanted with you and you lost. And to hint that the voters are stupid and that the only reason they voted was because they were &quot;conned&quot; is blatantly disgusting. Who do they think we are?</p>
