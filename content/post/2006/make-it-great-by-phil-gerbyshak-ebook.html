<p>My favourite blog to read is <a href="http://makeitgreat.org">Make it Great</a>, so when Phil told me he released a book my first instinct was to buy buy buy! Unfortuantely a university student&#39;s pockets are not very deep, but now I finally have enough to get it.</p>
<p>I noticed on the website where it is being sold, Booksurge, that they offer an eBook version as well, which would be great for me because I&#39;m obsessed with eBooks at the moment and I&#39;d love to have this on my virtual &quot;bookshelf&quot;, it would be convenient because as a uni student I don&#39;t exactly have much shelf space constantly moving from place to place, and also I&#39;d be free from the United States &#8594; Australia postage!</p>
<p>Before I rush out though and spend mu USD 7.99, does anyone know the format of the eBook? PDF? Microsoft Reader? If it&#39;s the latter, it would be useless for my Mac or *BSD boxes, for obvious reasons ;).</p>
