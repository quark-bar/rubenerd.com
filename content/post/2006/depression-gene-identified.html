<p>According to Channel 10 Late News about 45 seconds ago, researchers at the University of New South Wales in Sydney have identified a gene that is directly linked to depression. Interesting. Let&#39;s hope I can type all this stuff down before I forget it!</p>
<p>The study was carried out over 25 years and shows a direct link between a specific gene and feelings of depression. While the gene doesn&#39;t <strong>cause</strong> depression, it can trigger it when give the right stimulus, such as a negative life expereince.</p>
<p>It showed that when people without the specific gene encountered difficulty in life, 30% became <strong>seriously</strong> depressed, compared to a whopping 80% occurance in people with the gene.</p>
<p>The good news, it is treatable. I&#39;m looking into it.</p>
