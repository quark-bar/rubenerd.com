<p>Just finished watching the Queen&#39;s official opening of the new extention of the Sydney Opera House. I think Channel 9&#39;s reporter on the scene said it right: that in the future Australia will become a republic, but for now the Queen is our head of state, she looked great and she put a lof of effort into coming in, so we should give her our support.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a self-confessed Australian republican, but I admit seeing the Queen there was pretty cool, espcially seeing as she&#39;s touching 80 soon!</p>
<p>Once Prince Charles becomes king, I think that will be the right time to be a republicâ€¦ King Charles of Australia? ARGH!</p>
