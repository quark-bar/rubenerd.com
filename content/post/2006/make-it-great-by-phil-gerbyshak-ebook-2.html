<p>In a follow up to <a href="//rubenerd.com/?p=158">yesterday&#39;s post with the same title</a> regarding purchasing Phil Gerbyshak&#39;s eBook on BookSurge and being able to read it on Mac OS X, I got an email back today:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Ruben,<br />

<p>Client_Comments : G’day, I’m interested in buying a couple of books in the eBook format, I was just inquiring as to what format they are and whether they’re compatible with Mac OS X. Cheers &#8211; Ruben</p></blockquote>
<p>Good stuff!</p>
