<p>At the risk of sounding cliche, this particular <a href="http://www.coffeebean.com.sg/">Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf</a> at the <a href="http://www.junction8.com.sg/">Junction 8</a> in Bishan has always been special, not least because it wasâ€¦</p>
<ul>
<li>where I had my first black cup of coffee!</li>
<li>the closest coffee shop to Veritas, the first company I worked for when I left high school in those few months before uni started</li>
<li>where <a href="http://ftanjono.tumblr.com/">Felix Tanjono</a> and I would meet after school</li>
<li>where I met my first lady friend :)</li>
<li>where Felix Tanjono and I would meet for brekkie for their unlimited coffee before 11am!</li>
</ul>
<p>Meeting someone from work today there I noticed that it had changed; they&#39;ve extended it out and added more tables. Aside from that it&#39;s the same, and good to know it&#39;s still here!</p>
