<p>It's been a pretty dry week here on <em>Rubénerd</em>. So here’s <a href="http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51763701">Omame’s Kill la Kill art</a> with the characters looking like pinup girls. I really like this retro style!</p>

<p>Alas, Clara and I dropped the serie a few episodes before its conclusion. Action gets so dull when relied upon to carry an entire plot for more than a few episodes. Someone (anyone?), convince us to finish this.</p>
