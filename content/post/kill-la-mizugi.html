<p>It's been a pretty dry week here on <em>Rub√©nerd</em>. So here are the Kill la Kill girls looking like pinup girls. I really like this retro style! Now they just need to be <a href="">one pieces</a>, and we'd be in business.</p>

<p>Alas, Clara and I dropped the serie a few episodes before its conclusion. Action gets so dull when relied upon to carry an entire plot for more than a few episodes. Someone (anyone?), convince us to finish this!</p>
