<p>A brief housekeeping note and apology if I duplicated a bunch of posts in your blog reader. Earlier this week I put an SSD in my Mac Pro and had to reformat OS X; then I promptly forgot to set my TZ environment variable. This reset all the dates on everything, which some readers construed as new posts.</p>
<p>Defining GUIDs was supposed to prevent this behavior.I suppose enough readers have seemed malformed feeds with duplicated GUIDs, and define uniqueness from a mix of attributes.</p>
