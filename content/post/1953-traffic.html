<p>Seems like even as early as the 1950s we knew we couldn&#39;t just keep building cars to solve our transport problems, but our own laziness, greed, sense of entitlement and ultimately short sightedness means we&#39;re still dealing with these problems at the start of the 2010s. Whooptie do.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Traffic_Jam,1953.jpg">photo</a> depicts a &quot;Traffic jam at Venice Boulevard and La Cienega Boulevard in Los Angeles, Calif. in 1953&quot;, now in the public domain in the US.</p>
<p>I get the feeling my favourite honorary (is that the right word?) Canadian <a href="http://tyrtle.wordpress.com/">Todd Tyrtle</a> would have something to say about this too!</p>
