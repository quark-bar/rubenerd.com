<p>Usually I&#39;m okay with <a title="Post: An unexpected trip back to Singapore" href="http://rubenerd.com/unexpected-singapore-trip/">flights</a>, but the combined jetlag from a turbulent <a title="Wikipedia article: Red-eye flight" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-eye_flight">redeye</a> and a late morning <a title="Wikipedia article: Grilled cheese sandwich" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grilled_cheese_sandwich">connection</a> rendered me utterly incapable of doing anything productive. I try to blog at least once a day though, so I decided to comment on this <a title="View all posts tagged with K-On" href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/k-on/">K-On</a> image now circulating.</p>
<p>I ask you, how can you possibly have Shine without <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/kotobuki-tsumugi/">Mugi</a>?! She&#39;s the best character! Perhaps she&#39;s holding the camera. Can you get handheld piano cameras? I suppose that&#39;d be an accordion camcorder, or an <strong>accamcorder</strong>. Hey, I like that, <strong>accamcorder</strong>. I should write an accamcorder iPhone app.</p>
