I have no doubt our laws will one day reflect this.</p></blockquote>
<p>+1 <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/marriage-of-equality-is-a-core-value-for-all-to-hold-dear-20111118-1nn28.html">Penny Wong</a>. Kudos.</p>
<p>One need only replace the label &quot;homosexual&quot; with another such as &quot;White&quot; or &quot;Slave&quot; in arguments against gay marriage to understand just how abhorrent (and I&#39;d argue unconstitutional) the idea of denying these people dignity and rights really are. History doesn&#39;t look favourably on those against equality.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">(Comments are closed. From past experience these posts attract xenophobic hatred and ad hominum attacks, and I couldnâ€™t be bothered dealing with them).</p>
