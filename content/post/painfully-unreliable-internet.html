<p>This DSL internet connection we have in this shared house is slowly destroying my hairline. It&#39;s TPG 1.5mbit ADSL and the modem connects to it for roughly 20 to 30 minutes before it decides to disconnect. Sometimes its more like every 5 minutes. I any event I&#39;m ready to throw it out the window!!!</p>

<p>And now I&#39;ve clicked Connect and 10 minutes have past. So I thought I&#39;d reconnect to the modem to see if it had worked:</p>

<p>Ha! That&#39;s classic! Excuse me while I rip some more hair out. No wait, hitting refresh, I&#39;m back at the modem setup again:</p>

<p>So the DSL is up, the downstream/upstream speeds have been established and I have DNS server references, but STILL no IP address and therefore vis a vis ergo wysiwyg its still not connected. Brilliant.</p>
<p>I would be more enthusiastic, however the fact that I do this dance with this internet connection about 3 times an hour… I want my Starhub MaxOnline 8mbit connection back! Hopefully if you&#39;re reading this though, I&#39;ve managed to upload it and therefore vis a vis ergo wysiwyg we have internet again. Here&#39;s me hoping.</p>
