<p>Well today in Java we learnt how to throw our own exceptions. Because <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Exception.html">Exception</a> is an inherited object of <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Throwable.html">Throwable</a> rather than just a primitive or a pointer we can create our own Exception objects for circumstances where we want Java to treat an event in the same way as an error.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
public class TrekError extends Throwable {
  public TrekError() {
    // pass to superclass (Throwable) constructor
    super("Your logic is fatally flawed!");
  }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<pre>
public class TestTrekError {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws TrekError {
    boolean trekBetterThanWars = true;
    if (trekBetterThanWars == false) {
      throw new TrekError();
    } else {
      System.out.println("Live long and prosper!");
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>As I think back to programs I&#39;ve written in the past in other languages this could have been quite useful! Do Ruby and Python offer similar capability?</p>
<p>The main question I had that I didn&#39;t have time to ask in the lecture though was what the &quot;better&quot; or more correct way to use this in Java is. Are there circumstances where you could use such a technique but it would be a cheap shortcut rather than writing robust code? I suspect for all the usefullness that could be derived from this, it could also be easily abused.</p>
