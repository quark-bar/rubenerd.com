<p>Just came back from working (on a Saturday, argh!) only to discover that I couldn&#39;t access the <a href="http://www.wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Whole Wheat Radio</a> website, and both the low and high audio streams just keep buffering without sound :(.</p>

<p>Our DSL connection here in Malaysia is far from reliable so quite possibly this is a local problem, or it could be something else. Anyone else having trouble? I was all ready to put in another <em>Kevin So</em> request :(.</p>
<p>The only other thing I can think of is maybe it&#39;s offline for maintainence because at this time of day most of North America is asleep.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE: Sunday, 01:30am: The streams not being able to connect were a result of my computer changing its IP address. DHCP sucks. But I still can&#39;t access the site</em></p>
