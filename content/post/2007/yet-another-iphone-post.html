<p>So apparently the <a href="http://apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a>, the device Apple is entering into the global mobile phone market, will be available tonight in the United States. Of course if you&#39;ve used the internet at all in the last few weeks you&#39;d already know about that.</p>
<p>So to spare you the agony of reading <strong>yet another</strong> stupid iPhone post, I will not be posting about it.</p>
<p>Aren&#39;t you grateful? Hey wait a minute.</p>
