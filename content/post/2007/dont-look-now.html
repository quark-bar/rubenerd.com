<p>It doesn&#39;t matter that <a href="http://www.animeyume.org/series.php?id=76">Elfen Lied</a>… according to WordPress this is <a href="//rubenerd.com/">Rubenerd Blog</a> post <strong>number 666</strong>. <em>Wooooh!</em></p>
<p><a href="//rubenerd.com/"><img id="image667" src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/elfenlied666.jpg" alt="Elfen Lied" /></a></p>
<p>I was actually only shown a few episodes of that anime… and it freaked me out. Well, not really, but… okay yeah it did. Shaddup.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It turns out this isn’t really post number 666, WordPress-assigned IDs don’t exactly correlate with how many posts are published. Oh well, I was close!</p></blockquote>
