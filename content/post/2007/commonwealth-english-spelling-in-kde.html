<p>If you&#39;re a use of KDE and would prefer to have the British English spelling instead of the Americanizationed English (is that a word), there are several ways to get it.</p>
<p>The KDE Localisation project has an en_gb team at <a href="http://www.kde.me.uk/index.php?page=kde-en-gb">http://www.kde.me.uk/index.php?page=kde-en-gb</a>.</p>
<p>If you use KDE on FreeBSD like me, there is also a localisation tarball in the ports collection.</p>
<p>Now only if they had a Singlish version as well. Can you imagine it?</p>
<blockquote><p>Salamat Datang ke KDE! Apa kabar? Program install fail. Wah lah. Hey ang moh, chicken are you?</p></blockquote>
