<p>I&#39;m having an unusually free day today. Aside from taking my mum to oncology and doing some light programming catchup work for university things have been smooth sailing. So I thought I&#39;d spend the morning at <a href="http://www.simlimsquare.com.sg/">Sim Lim Square</a>, one of the two heavyweights in the Singapore dedicated computer shopping centre scene.</p>
<p>My mission was to buy a replacement processor and motherboard for my dad&#39;s desktop which was turned into a brick on the move back from Kuala Lumpur. I ended up getting the dual-core energy efficent 65W <strong>Athlon 64 X2 4000+</strong> CPU and an <strong>ASUS M2NPV-VM</strong> motherboard bundled for <strong>SG$240.00</strong> and some stock PC6400 1GB RAM for <strong>SG$64.00</strong>.</p>
<p>The prices blew me away mostly because I could remember just a few years ago when the X2s were so elite and high end they were in the thousands of dollars. It&#39;s amazing how yesterday&#39;s <q>high end</q> chips become today&#39;s <q>value</q> ones so fast.</p>

<p>By no means is the motherboard state of the art, but my dad has two very large capacity PATA hard disks and two expensive optical drives so I had to get a board that hadn&#39;t jettisoned their legacy internal connectors for SATA. They&#39;re becoming more difficult to find.</p>
<p>With all these awesome parts for such peanuts, it sure makes my NetBSD Athlon XP 2800+ look crappy now!</p>
