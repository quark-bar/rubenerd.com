<p><a href="http://www.crankygeeks.com/">Cranky Geeks</a> is one of the best video podcasts I watchâ€¦ probably because it&#39;s one of the only video podcasts I watch. No but seriously it&#39;s a fantastic show, I encourage you to check it out especially if you enjoy lighthearted and cranky discussion of tech trends and the well-deserved ridiculing of stupid news stories.</p>

<p>A great show! Om added a lot of colour and Matt and Sebastian made some great points, especially about the ridiculous idea about the bloggers union. There&#39;s definitely chemistry between all these people!</p>
<p>The pictures for the stories with Om, Matt and John&#39;s heads superimposed were the best ones so far.</p>
<p>What I want to know is, why wasn&#39;t Cranky Geeks nominated on PodcastAwards.com? What a bunch of alleged frig-tards ;)</p>
