<p>After a long time developing the alternative version of this site, the real world has finally set in and I&#39;ve decided not to move over to the new platform. When I see how much work it would take to transition over versus the amount of time I have to do such things, I decided just to stay with <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> for the <a href="http://rubenerdshow.com/">Show</a> and <a href="http://rubenerd.com/">Blog</a> for the time being after all.</p>
<p>All my work has not gone to waste though, I was able to submit it as part of a project and got a perfect score, so it fulfilled it&#39;s purpose. And I learned a great deal about how trackbacks, pings and blog engines actually work, which makes me appreciate what WordPress offers even more.</p>
<p>Then there was the financial problem. It would probably surprise nobody given it&#39;s IT savviness that Singapore has a mind boggling array of web hosting companies, but none of them provide Ruby on Rails support unless you purchase <strong>Business</strong> plans, which are in the <strong>three digits per month</strong>. As a struggling university student <a href="http://greens.org.au/campaigns/display.php?campaign=education">living under a John Howard government</a> (albeit externally) you can understand why I couldn&#39;t afford it!</p>
<p>With that in mind, I&#39;m going to modify the new theme I had created so it can be used with WordPress. This week I have less work so I&#39;ve promised myself that by this time next week, the new show and blog site will be up and running. That&#39;s a promise!</p>
<p>The next step, even though WordPress is PHP, can you write plugins for it in Ruby? :D</p>
