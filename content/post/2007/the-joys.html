<p>My mum is clinically depressed for obvious reasons and she&#39;s on large amounts of medication so when I am at the reciving end of her abuse, I know it&#39;s the medication and the depression talking not her. Still it&#39;s very hard lah, just have to keep a straight back and let it slide because I know she doesn&#39;t mean it.</p>
<p>I get the feeling I&#39;ll be taking refuge outside the house all day again tomorrow, for my own safety. Starbucks at Jusco Aeon Cheras Selatan. Then Coffee Bean at KLCC. With my laptop. Sounds like a plan.</p>
<p>The removalists/packers/people for our house won&#39;t be back until Monday so at least that also gives me some time to finish up my room after all this cools down again. Hopefully the people in Singapore will be able to help her again when we get there.</p>
