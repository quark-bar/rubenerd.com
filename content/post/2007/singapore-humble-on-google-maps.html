<p>Sometimes when you&#39;re in Singapore or have been there before you forget just how friggen small it is. While you&#39;re there it feels like you&#39;re in large city, and it&#39;s easy to forget that outside that large city, there&#39;sâ€¦ nothing more! No suburbia, no endless plains, nothing.</p>
<p>Case in point I was looking at Google Earth. Singapore is the only city/country in the region that has had its roads and whatnot traced so far. What it shows is something that just looks spooky:</p>
<p><img id="image720" src="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/humblesingapore.png" alt="humblesingapore.png" /></p>
<p>That&#39;s the entire friggen country! There are more than 4.5 million people living on that thing that&#39;s less than 50km&#39;s wide! The landmass to the left and most of the islands south of Singapore are part of Indonesia, the landmass directly above Singapore is Malaysia.</p>
<p>You can view it for yourself <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;q=singapore&#038;layer=&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=8&#038;ll=1.301768,103.848267&#038;spn=3.645905,3.647461&#038;om=1">here</a>.</p>
