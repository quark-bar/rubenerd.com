<p>If you&#39;ve read this weblog at all in the last year you would know about my current <strong>obsession with FreeBSD</strong>. To tell the truth I&#39;ve only been using it seriously for a year now but it&#39;s been long enough to convert all the idle machines in our house over to it from all the different flavours of Linux and… heaven forbid… Windows… and I&#39;ve already started using it seriously in my work and studies.</p>
<p>Another bonus, everything I learn about it helps me to understand a bit more of the inner workings of Mac OS X as well, my other favourite OS.</p>
<p>My biggest problem though with learning about FreeBSD, and most technology in general, is the method I used to do it. Aside from reading the handbook, as with most things I teach myself most of what I need to know <strong>through experimenting</strong>. I find reading through chapters upon chapters of thick reference books doesn&#39;t really work me, I learn faster by just using it (a fact which I&#39;m sure agitated many of my university practical teachers).</p>
<p>All that said though, I think I&#39;ve stumbled upon one of the best technology books I&#39;ve ever read: <a href="amazon.com/FreeBSD-6-Unleashed-Brian-Tiemann/dp/0672328755">FreeBSD 6 Unleashed</a>. It seriously feels as though Michael Urban and Brian Tiemann looked into my mind and saw how I learn things, and wrote a book specifically tailored for me. It is the <strong>Swiss Army Knife</strong> of FreeBSD books!</p>
<p>As with most of the SAMS Unleashed series of books it&#39;s thicker than John Howard (cha ching!) but it covers such a diverse and interesting range of topics. By reading it you get an understanding of not only how to install, administer and update a FreeBSD system, but also some complex general UNIX, how to install web servers, use SQL, setting up a graphical workstation, simple Perl and shell scripting, choosing shells… the list just keeps going.</p>
<p>What I appreciate most though is how each chapter is laid out. At the beginning you&#39;re given a brief introduction with some technical background and explanation, followed by a step by step guide with plenty of examples and sidebars.</p>
<p>My only regret with buying this book is that I didn&#39;t do it sooner! If you&#39;re serious about learning anything and everything about FreeBSD I would really recommend it.</p>
