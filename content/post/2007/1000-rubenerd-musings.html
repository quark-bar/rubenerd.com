<p>I was confused for a long time about how <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> organises posts and other media, so when I saw that <a href="//rubenerd.com/dont-look-now/">one of my posts had been assigned the number 666</a> I assumed it meant I had typed up 666 weblog posts. As it turns out WordPress assigns all the media you upload a unique number, so in actual fact I had typed far less than I thought.</p>
<p>With that said, WordPress has assigned this particular entry an ID number of 1000! Yay! Does it mean anything? No! Am I excited? Yes! Why? Because 1000 is a big number!</p>
<p>So here&#39;s to 1000 Rubenerd Blog… items… or whatever the heck they are. 1000 somethings!</p>
