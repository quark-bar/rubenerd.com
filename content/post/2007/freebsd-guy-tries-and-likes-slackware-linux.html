<p><a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/freebsd/"><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/bsd_daemon.jpg" alt="FreeBSD!" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 10px 20px" /></a>By now if you&#39;ve read this blog in any great detail (or even if you haven&#39;t) you&#39;d know by now I love <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> and intend to use it as my primary desktop and server OS by the end of the year. Booh-yah!</p>
<p>Anyway I&#39;ve had to admit lately though that most open source software isn&#39;t written for FreeBSD but for Linux, and for ages I&#39;ve been looking for a Linux distro that as a FreeBSD user I could feel comfortable using; not to replace FreeBSD but just as an alternative I could dual boot into from time to time to keep myself up to date with Tux. Plus my work and university studies require Linux, so would be useful to have a real world test bed.</p>
<p><a href="http://rubenerd.com/category/slackware-linux/"><img id="image700" src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/slacklogo.gif" alt="Slackware" style="float:right; width:150px; margin: 0 0 10px 20px" /></a>In my search I&#39;ve steered farily clear of distros like <a href="http://distrowatch.com/Fedora">Fedora</a>, <a href="http://chucknorrisfacts.com/">Chuck Norris</a>, <a href="http://distrowatch.com/suse">openSUSE</a>, <a href="http://distrowatch.com/pclinuxos">PCLinuxOS</a> and <a href="http://distrowatch.com/Ubuntu">Ubuntu</a>/Kubuntu/Xubuntu/KitchenSinkuntu; personally I like to have more control over the installation and prefer to set up things like the shell, X11, packages and networking myself. A few years ago I would have shuddered at the thought of doing configuration on the command line, these days I can&#39;t see myself doing it any other way. There&#39;s something to be said for installing a barebones system and configuring everything yourself afterwards. Or maybe I&#39;m just a freak ;).</p>
<p>Just for fun I downloaded through the torrents the latest version of <a href="http://slackware.com/">Slackware Linux</a> (using the optional 2.6.18 kernel) and gave it a shot; and was pleasently surprised! As compared to FreeBSD, the Slackware installer is very similar, the directory structure is very similar and the system just feels more UNIXy which I like. Plus it just seems clean and well designed as opposed to some of the more top-heavy distros which feel slapped together, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>A comparison of the installers: here&#39;s FreeBSD 6.2:</p>

<p>And here&#39;s Slackware 11.0:</p>

<p>As you can see, it&#39;s no wonder I felt right at home installing :).</p>
<p>As for documentation, the <a href="http://www.slackbook.org/">Slackbook</a> is fantastic and easy to follow, and the man pages are well put together.</p>
<p>So far I&#39;ve tried <a href="http://distrowatch.com/gentoo">Gentoo</a>, <a href="http://distrowatch.com/debian">Debian</a> and now Slackware and I feel as if I&#39;m more inclined to use the latter! Installing dependencies on packages myself will take some getting used to (I&#39;ve been spoilt by the FreeBSD ports system!) but I&#39;m sure it will be a great learning experience. Or I could chicken out and use NetBSD&#39;s pkgsrc for it ;).</p>
