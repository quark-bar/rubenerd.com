<div style="font-style:italic">LATEST,<br />
THURSDAY MORNING: The Indonesians are feeling aftershocks and so are we here. I definitely felt the one this morning.</div>
<p>An earthquake this afternoon rocked Indonesia today and we in Singapore felt it too. Actually I didn&#39;t, maybe I was on the MRT at the time and didn&#39;t feel any difference, but it was enough for the Singaporean authorities to evacuate people from downtown:</p>
<blockquote><p>SINGAPORE : Singapore buildings swayed after an earthquake hit Indonesia on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Residents in various parts of the island felt the quake and people in some buildings, including in the central business district, were evacuated as a safety precaution.</p>
<p>Areas in Singapore which felt the tremors included Novena, Paris Ris, Raffles Place, Potong Pasir, Marsiling, Toa Payoh and Thomson Road.</p>
<p>Singaporeâ€™s Meteorological Services said the earthquake measured 8.5 on the Richter Scale. The preliminary reading was 7.9.</p>
<p>The earthquake struck out at sea at 7.10pm. Its epicentre was 120 kilometres south-west of the Sumatran town of Bengkulu, at a depth of 15 kilometres.</p>
<p>This is some 670 kilometres from Singapore.</p>

<p>Indonesia has sent out a tsunami alert, let&#39;s all hope it spares those poor people too much damage. God knows they&#39;ve suffered enough from huge waves in the last few years. The 2004 Asian tsunami <a href="http://rubenerd.com/boxing-day-palm-pilots/">was one of my first posts</a> on this weblog.</p>
