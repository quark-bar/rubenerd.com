<p>I&#39;m sitting at my desk,<br />
It&#39;s almost 1 AM;<br />
My pillow is wondering,<br />
Where I am.</p>
<p>The room lights are off,<br />
As dark as an attic;<br />
I&#39;m wearing headphones,<br />
Listening to static.</p>
<p>I could push off to bed,<br />
And the computer off switch;<br />
Have to get up early tomorrow,<br />
But insomnia is a bitch.</p>
<p>So for now I&#39;ll sit,<br />
And wait till I doze;<br />
Counting syllables is too boring,<br />
When you&#39;re writing such crappy prose.</p>
<p>I could try to enjoy life,<br />
Relax and be gay;<br />
But really what&#39;s the point,<br />
Anyway?</p>
