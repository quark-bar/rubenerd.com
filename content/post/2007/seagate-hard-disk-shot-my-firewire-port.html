<p>I have a lot of data. The fact I&#39;ve used computers since before I could talk and have never deleted <strong>anything</strong> (and I mean <strong>anything</strong>, I have a picture of a horse I drew in Windows 3.0 Paintbrush dated 1990, which meant I was 4!) means today I have gigs upon gigs of stuff.</p>
<p>So yesterday to ease the latest squeeze on my three external hard disks (an Iomega 160GB, a Western Digital 320GB and a Western Digital 160GB) I purchased a Seagate 400GB one-touch external hard disk. I got the Seagate because it was the most affordable external hard disk that still has FireWire 400, a port which you are no doubt aware is becoming increasingly rare these days.</p>

<p>So I plugged in my new Seagate external hard disk into the FireWire 400 port on my MacBook Pro and proceeded to the Mac OS X Disk Utility as per the instructions in the manual (IRTFM), only to discover that not only was there no new device detected at all, but I smelt the telltale smell of <strong>electrical smoke</strong>. I panicked and pulled out the FireWire plug.</p>
<p>Since then I&#39;ve tried to plug in my other external FireWire 400 hard disk and my old third generation FireWire iPod and neither are being detected. And I don&#39;t mean they&#39;re not being <em>mounted</em>, I mean they&#39;re not being <em>detected</em>. A check in System Profiler shows that there is nothing being detected on the port at all:</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gone to the Apple support website and have read the <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=88338">FireWire troubleshooting article</a>, <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=303319">reset the &quot;Pro System Management Controller&quot; (SMC)</a>, reset the <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=2238">PRAM and NVWAM</a> without any success leading me to one conclusion: what I smelt was the smoke coming from my toasted FireWire controller or port.</p>
<p>Oh but it gets better! Because I got my MacBook Pro in March 2006, the warranty has expired. The FireWire port in the MacBook Pro is part of the motherboard, so I will have to have the whole board replaced which could cost an absolute fortune.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a lawyer and I&#39;m not studying law at university, but I know that it&#39;s not my fault that my FireWire port is now dead. I used the Seagate external hard disk exactly as the instructions said, no funky business, and now I have a dead FireWire port and possibly a dead external hard disk. I know it&#39;s my right to demand a new hard disk from Seagate, but what about my damaged motherboard in my MacBook Pro?</p>

<p>If I was the kind of person who didn&#39;t use FireWire that much I could probably just ignore that port and get on fine without it, but I do video editing, I have a FireWire-only iSight and another external FireWire-only hard disk which I use because it puts less strain on the CPU than USB 2.0 does under very heavy loadsâ€¦ <em>this port is critical to my studies and to my work</em>, and it&#39;s completely <em>dead</em>.</p>
<p>And what about my other external FireWire drive? I have no way of getting the data off that until my other computers are unpacked from our move which won&#39;t be for another 5 weeks!</p>
<p>What do I do? :(</p>
