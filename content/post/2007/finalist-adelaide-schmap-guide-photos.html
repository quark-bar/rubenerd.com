<p>Having moved over to <a href="http://zooomr.com/photos/rubenerd/sets/">Zooomr</a> in the <a href="//rubenerd.com/zooomr-singapore-national-day-chinook/">last month</a> (and <a href="//rubenerd.com/even-more-zooomr-troubles/">contemplating</a> paying for my Pro Flickr account again after Zooomr related trauma) I hadn&#39;t checked my venerable old (and quite embarrassing!) <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/">Flickr account</a> in a while, and given the quality of most of my photos there, is it surprising?</p>
<p>I was surprised though when I loaded the Welcome Screen I found a message waiting for me from <a href="http://www.schmap.com/">Schmap Guides</a>:</p>

<p>Apparently they saw two photos I took at a <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/">railway museum back in 2004</a> and another shot I took with my then-roommate Chris Szeto <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/sets/72157594239185641/">at Mount Lofty</a>. I was really shocked because not just because some of my photos had been chosen, but because of the qualityâ€¦ I&#39;d taken most of them with my 2003 vintage Panasonic 3.0 megapixel consumer camera, and the focus (pun intended) was just taking quick snaps, certainly not ones I would submit for anything important.</p>
<p>I guess as the (modified) adage goes: upload thousands of photos and one of them will turn out fine.</p>
