<p>Having used Mac OS X Leopard now for just over a week I can safely say I&#39;ve had a fairly painless experience using software that was released in the Tiger era, though there have been a few gotchas. In case it&#39;s useful to someone I&#39;m posting information on some of the applications I&#39;ve had minor troubles with.</p>
<p><em>This is by no means an authoritative study, and it is possible that the software problems I&#39;ve posted here might be a result of my own unique computer configuration or even misunderstanding on my own part, in which case feel free to correct me by posting a comment :).</em></p>
<h3>X11.app</h3>
<p>X11 to me <em>feels</em> like it&#39;s exactly the same in Leopard as it was in Tiger; the title bars and bundled apps are exactly the same. I remember reading somewhere that Leopard was going to be bundled with an Xorg distribution instead of XFree86.</p>
<p>Anyway those issues aside, the problem I seem to have is that even though I move the X11.app icon to the Dock from the Utilities folder, whenever I launch an application that uses X11, another identical X11 icon appears at the end of the dock and the first one that I placed there crashes. This has happened on two wipes and reinstalls of Leopard.</p>
<p>The other issue I have is that X11 doesn&#39;t respect the space limits imposed by the Apple menu. If you try and move any normal window on OS X above the Apple menu it doesn&#39;t work, but X11 apps are more than happy to creep behind the menu which makes them that much harder to grab and bring back down again:</p>
<h3>Inkscape.app</h3>
<p>For some reason when I try and launch Inkscape it informs me that I don&#39;t have an X11 compatible environment installed and promptly quits. To work around this, I launch X11 first then Inkscape and it works. Pain in the arse though to have to launch two apps just to use one.</p>

<h3>Last.fm.app</h3>
<p>The official LastFM client is really spotty for me in Leopard. Just like X11 when I launch LastFM it launches two concurrent versions of it, one of which instantly crashes.</p>

<p>Force quitting the one that&#39;s stuffed up leaves the other working just fine though. Just a small pain to have to deal with every time.</p>
<h3>The Good News!</h3>
<p>With all those issues you&#39;d think I&#39;ve been having a terrible time in Leopard with third party applications: fortunately the ones that work far outweigh the ones that don&#39;t.</p>
<p>This is my current list of apps I&#39;ve used in Leopard that work just fine: Quicksilver, VMware Fusion (1.0 and 1.1 Beta), Camino (1.5.2 and 1.5.3), Thunderbird (2.0.0.6), iSquint, NeoOffice, VLC, TextMate, Flickr Uploadr, Xee, the MAMP web server, Snitter and Cyberduck.</p>
