<p>I&#39;m becoming increasingly worried about my mum. Physically she&#39;s coping well with the chemo (well as well as you can expect her to be coping considering she&#39;s been having it for over a decade now) but mentally I&#39;m really scared that it&#39;s another story entirely.</p>
<p>Almost her whole life now is spent either in bed or in her chair up in her bedroom and her sense of humour is fading. I really seem to rub her the wrong way and get into her bad books with her a lot more now which is really hard to get used to. I keep telling myself it&#39;s just the drugs and chemo that&#39;s talking not her, but it&#39;s still unnerving.</p>
<p>I&#39;m worried as well that she&#39;s losing hope too; and it&#39;s not surprising. The fact she almost never has any energy would be maddening. I talk of course from the point of view of someone who has never had chemo before and cannot even begin to comprehend what it would be like.</p>
<p>I think part of it as well stems from the press being all over people like Kylie Minogue who had to endure chemo for just over 6 months, a drop in the bucket compared to what my mum has had. Of course I&#39;m not trying to dismiss what poor Kylie would have gone through, but you can understand my mum&#39;s perspective.</p>
<p>This has been going on for more than a decade, and I think we are all just fed up. I just really hope that being fed up and frustrated doesn&#39;t translate into giving up. From what my dad has told me she has tried to several times in the past, but has always chosen to soldier on. I love my mum as a mum but also as one of my best friends.</p>
<p>Given the type of cancer she has, she&#39;ll be having chemo on and off for the rest of her life until they come up with a cure. It&#39;s for this reason above all else that I get so amazinly angry with people like George W. Bush and John Howard when they would much rather blow people up than help fund vital medical research. I don&#39;t remember who said it, but I remember reading a quote that went somewhere along the lines of &quot;all money that is spent on weapons is robbery from the poor and sick&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#39;m waffling and talking politics again, so I&#39;ll stop here. As Spike Milligan said: &quot;the end of [the blog post] is the best place to stop writing&quot;.</p>
