<p>If you haven&#39;t signed the <a href="http://www.noooxml.org/petition">No Open Office XML Petition</a> yet, hurry over and do it right now. Microsoft&#39;s efforts to ratify their file formats as a standard must be stopped not just because there&#39;s <a href="http://www.odfalliance.org/">already an Open Document format standard</a>, but because <a href="http://www.noooxml.org/start">their implementation is flawed and broken</a> and adopting it will cause all kinds of problems and the eventual destruction of the world as we know it.</p>
<p>For the reasons why and to sign the partition go to <a href="http://www.noooxml.org/petition">http://www.noooxml.org/petition</a>.</p>

Comments: This newly proposed &#8220;standard&#8221; being pushed (and bribed) by Microsoft is a genuine threat to interoperability and must be dismissed. Microsoft, a convicted monopolist in multiple jurisdictions must NOT be allowed under any circumstances to push through these file formats.
