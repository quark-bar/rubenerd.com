<p>Anyone who used the internet in the 1990s would remember <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator">Netscape Navigator</a>, the standalone web browser before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Communicator">Netscape Communicator</a> that you originally had to pay for: the software that Microsoft was so successful in burying all those years ago in the first internet browser wars. I used Netscape Navigator, Eudora and ICQâ€¦ sniff, so many memories!</p>

<p>Well I&#39;m now typing away on <a href="http://browser.netscape.com/">Netscape Navigator 9</a> for Mac OS X. After all those years of feature creep, slower speeds and bloated executable sizes, the new Navigator is lean, mean and noticeably zippier. It&#39;s based on <a href="http://mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a> instead of the former Mozilla Suite and it shows. Plus, it supports nearly all the Firefox plugins and themes too.</p>
<p>Aside from the obvious changes under the hood, the new Navigator has also been redesigned on the surface. The new toolbar icons are much clearer and instead of a separate search button next to the Address bar there&#39;s a dedicated search box. The toolbar, tabs and titlebar with these changes noticeably take up less space. Compared to <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> and <a href="http://caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a> (my current primary browser) the difference is tiny:</p>

<p>Really I can&#39;t see enough compelling reasons to switch if you&#39;re already a Firefox user, but for me there&#39;s something so nostalgic and pleasing to grace my modern computer&#39;s dock and Applications directory with that venerable serif <strong>N</strong> on a black planet scape with the teal sky. I&#39;m so sentimental (^_^).</p>
