<p>Microsoft never ceases to amaze me. In case you <a href="http://www.news.com/2100-1024-6218875.html?tag=tb">haven&#39;t read the news</a> floating around these last few weeks or listened to <a href="http://tech5.podshow.com/">John C. Dvorak rant on Tech5</a> about this story, Microsoft is hoping to become an &quot;aggresive player in online advertising&quot; and hopes that eventually half their revenue will come from advertising. As John would say: <strong>&quot;huh&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>What does advertising have to do with their business? It would be like GM making hairspray!</strong></p>
<p>I think most of us on the intertubes are becoming wary of Microsoft&#39;s efforts online. They suffer from the biggest case of &quot;me too!&quot; syndrome I&#39;ve ever seen: If Google or Technorati or Yahoo or Chuck Norris are doing it, by their very definition they need to sink billions into doing it to, regardless if it makes business sense.</p>
<p>This kind of thinking worked well for them on the desktop, but to think the market dynamics online are the same as for shrink-wrapped software, and therefore require the same approach to marketing and development, they&#39;re really in over their heads.</p>

<p>As we&#39;ve all said already, Microsoft should focus its efforts on actually producing decent operating systems and office suite software that people want to use. As an economics student I know all about the importance of diversification and spreading risk, but those are the things you concern yourself with <strong>once you have your core business sorted out</strong>. Given Vista&#39;s spectacular fall from grace (if it had any to start off with!) I think they should be more concerned with that right now. And that&#39;s not even mentioning their ridiculously low share price and middle management problems.</p>
<p>But what would I know, I run FreeBSD and Mac OS X right? ;-)</p>
