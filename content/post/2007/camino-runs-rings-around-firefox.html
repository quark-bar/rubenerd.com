<p>Today for a quick break from studies and work I decided once again to download the latest <a href="http://mozilla.com/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> for Mac and install it, and once again after half an hour it was wiped off my drive. Fact is, I&#39;ve been spoiled completely by <a href="http://caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no secret to anyone that Firefox is slow on Mac. In a time where virtually every other Mac app has been written to use the Cocoa widgets or even Qt, Firefox (and unfortunately Thunderbird) still use the OS 9 era throwback Carbon widgets which really shows. The graphics and user interface in Firefox look tired and outdated, whereas the graphics and user interface on Camino look polishedâ€¦ and damn it Camino looks like a real Mac app.</p>

<p>Those complaints aside though, using Firefox today on Mac reminded me once again why I stopped using it: the scroll speed is abysmal. Despite the fact I have a MacBook Pro which you can use the two finger motion on the touch pad to scroll I still prefer to use the keyboard arrow keys, and using these there&#39;s a noticeable lag. I&#39;d guess that Firefox scrolls at almost half the speed that both Camino or Safari do.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that Firefox on idle with one tab open somehow manages to use so much more RAM than Camino (or even Safari) do:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox#Backend_changes">According to Wikipedia</a> Gecko 1.9 will support native Cocoa widgets which should close this gap, then I&#39;ll be able to use all the wicked Firefox plugins. Until then, I&#39;ll continue using Camino, as I have for years.</p>
