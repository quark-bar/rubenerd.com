<p>I have a lot to keep myself occupied this weekend, I&#39;ve got several projects due in the not too distant future (aka: next week!) plus for a diversion when I need a quick break I got Train Simulator working again, plus the speculation about next year&#39;s Singaporean Formula 1 race is pretty exciting. If I have time I&#39;ll type up some stuff about it here.</p>
