<cite>Spam makes my head swell, and not because I bought dubious medication advertised in said spam which turned out to have scary skull swelling side effects. Was that fancy alliteration or what?</cite></p>
<p>After a couple of weeks using a WordPress plugin which would ask you to answer a mathematics question before you could post, I&#39;ve decided to take it off. It didn&#39;t really do anything to stop pesky spam getting through and just caused problems for some people.</p>
<p>I&#39;m really torn about what to do. This is a pretty meek weblog in the grand scheme of things and the <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">Rubenerd Show</a> is in a small niche, but sorting through all these messages every week is becoming a full time job in itself. That said though, for now I can&#39;t think of any alternatives.</p>
<p>WordPress allows me to automagically authorise any messages you post if you&#39;ve posted a message in the past I approved, but if you&#39;re a first time poster you&#39;ll have to wait for me to allow itâ€¦ just like before. Sorry lah.</p>
<p>Guess it&#39;ll give me more material for my <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/spam/">silly spam commentary</a> :).</p>
