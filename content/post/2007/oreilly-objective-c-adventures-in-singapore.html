<p>I&#39;ve been looking for a good, thick tome to work through to help me learn the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C">Objective C programming language</a>. Just like <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, I like the fact Objective C was also inspired from Smalltalk and given my past (icky) experience with C++ and the fact I run Mac OS X and FreeBSD (which has the GNU compilers) I figured it would be a cool language to work on for another study project, and gosh it just looks like a really interesting computer language. Girls love it when I talk like that you see.</p>
<p>Alas, <strong>Singapore seems to have as many books on Objective C as elephants have tails</strong>. Wait, elephants do have tails. That was a stupid comparison.</p>
<p>Anyway I&#39;ve searched at <a href="http://www.borders.com.sg/">Borders</a>, <a href="http://www.kinokuniya.com.sg">Kinokuniya</a>, Times, Popular… and nobody has anything other than For Dummies books on basic Cocoa development. My personal preference is the O&#39;Reilly book series simply because I remember having lots of fun learning Perl and Python from their books back when I was in high school and I like their format. The Dummies series were fun to learn Visual Basic from back when I was in primary, but these days they seem to chatty to me.</p>
<p>I know I&#39;m probably being really picky, but everyone learns in different ways and I find O&#39;Reilly books to click with me the best. <strong>So it begs the question, does anyone know of any good places to buy O&#39;Reilly books (or books that follow a similar style) on Objective C in Singapore?</strong></p>
<p>My next try will be to go to that really good computer book shop in Funan Centre, I&#39;m hoping they might have a better range that some of the generic chains. Or I could renew my subscription to <a href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">Safrai Books Online</a>, I&#39;m sure they&#39;d have some good material.</p>
