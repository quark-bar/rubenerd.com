<p>Listening to Angélique Kidjo sing Idjé-Idjé. Her music is so great to chill out too.</p>
<p>Hidey-ho again everyone. I&#39;d like to apologise for the chronic lack of updates to both the show and this site for the last few weeks, things here have been really crazy. Moving house internationally again, unpacking masses of boxes, taking care of my mum through it all, wading through the ocean of work I let accumulate while we were in the serviced apartment, it&#39;s crazy.</p>
<p>I finally caved though and got one of those blasted <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=643490932">Facebook</a> accounts. In my own defense, virtually everyone from my old high school is on it, and I must say it&#39;s a been a real boon to catch up with people I haven&#39;t talked to in a few years (some even longer than that!). If you use it, search for &quot;Ruben Schade&quot; and add me if you want. I&#39;ve also got my Twitter and Jaiku pages which I update through my handphone if you&#39;re really that interested in what I&#39;m up to.</p>
<p>I tell you what though the Ruby on Rails version of this site which I&#39;ve got running on my local webserver is looking really good and I can&#39;t wait to implement it. I&#39;m hoping once most of the boxes have been unpacked and my mum gets off this latest chemo regime and can start talking again I&#39;ll have a sliver of spare time to get it up and running.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for your patience.</p>
