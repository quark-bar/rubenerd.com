<p>I am a real fan of <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/kde/">KDE</a>, the desktop environment for Unix-like operating systems such as <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/freebsd/">FreeBSD</a> and <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/linux/">GNU/Linux</a>, and I&#39;m also a fan of the <a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt/">Qt Toolkit</a> upon which it&#39;s built. Qt is developed of course by the Norwegian <a href="http://trolltech.com/">Trolltech</a> company and is released under open source and proprietary licences depending on your circumstances. I firmly believe this is the <a href="http://trolltech.com/trolltech/company/about/businessmodel">software development business model</a> of the future because it gives the tools to the open source community while at the same time allowing the company to generate revenue for proprietary uses. It&#39;s also why I&#39;m a fan of <a href="http://mysql.org/">MySQL</a>, even if it&#39;s not as cool to be one ;).</p>

<p>Anyway Trolltech <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1186578575/">have expanded the permitted licences</a> you can publish your work under! From what I can tell previously you could release your work under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt">GNU General Public Licence 2.0</a> and before version 4.0 their own <a href="http://doc.trolltech.com/3.0/license.html">Q Public Licence</a>, but now amongst others you can now use it alongside the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/freebsd-license.html">BSD licence</a> (1999 vintage) and the <a href="http://trolltech.com/products/qt/gplexception_addendum">MIT licence</a>. As a predominantly FreeBSD and OS X user this is great news because I&#39;ve generally released my work under the BSD licence, and now I can do so with my graphical Qt applications :).</p>
<p>I applaud Trolltech&#39;s move and thank them for supporting the whole open source community. I&#39;d buy them each a coffee or a beer, but Norway is a long way away.</p>
