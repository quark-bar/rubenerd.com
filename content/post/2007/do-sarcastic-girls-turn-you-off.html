<p>What started off as emails regarding arabican caffinated beverages (none of that robusta Nescafe junk) has now progressed to the point where I was asked:</p>
<blockquote><p>Speaking of humor, I read that funny woman turn off men &#8211; women want a man who is a humor &#8220;generator,&#8221; while men seek a humor &#8220;appreciator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Based on experience, I say COMPLETELY True. Men are so threatened by sarcasm from women (Thanks, great professors of behavioral studies for only coming up with this now). What do you think?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there is some level of truth in your observations; it is true there is a feeling generated when you get someone to laugh that just feels darned good, and if it&#39;s a member of the opposite sex, more power to you ;).</p>
<p>From where I stand, I think it takes a certain level of intelligence to be able to pull off randomness and sarcasm; I guess to some men random sarcastic women are scary because they don&#39;t feel as smart and feel threatened intellectually.</p>
<p>To use computer networking terminology though (you speak what you know!): to me great humour isn&#39;t a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_communication">simplex</a> connection, it&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_communication">duplex</a>. In real world langauge, there isn&#39;t any point to humour if it&#39;s only one way. I want someone who I&#39;ve just zinged to zing me back! To me telling a joke to someone and just getting laughter in response is boring because there&#39;s no challenge. I might as well talk to a table with a canned laughter button (obligatory Monty Python reference).</p>
<p><img id="image617" src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/haruhisign.gif" alt="haruhisign.gif" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px" />I guess you could say that I&#39;m the exact opposite; I really like girls who can make me laugh! That&#39;s the reason why I am particularly drawn to the <a href="http://www.sos-dan.com/">The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</a> anime over most others: the protagonist is so ridiculous and preposterous in her actions and so completely random!</p>
<p>I&#39;d be interested to hear what other peoples have to say about it. Do sarcastic women turn <em>you</em> off? Do <em>you</em> prefer women that will just laugh at anything you say and not threaten you intellectually? Do <em>you</em> wear matching socks?</p>
