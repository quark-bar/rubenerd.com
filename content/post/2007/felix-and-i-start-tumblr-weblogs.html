<p>My good friend <a href="http://ftanjono.tumblr.com/">Felix had started his own Tumblr weblog</a> which looks really slick and is full of random good stuff!</p>
<blockquote class="aside"><p>ASIDE: I almost typed the word <strong>friend</strong> as <strong>fiend</strong>: would have meant something slightly different!</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="aside"><p>ASIDE: I’m currently listening to <strong>Bette Davis Eyes</strong> by <strong>Kim Carnes</strong>. As I typed in <strong>Tumblr</strong>, she sang &#8220;she’ll take a TUMBLE on you!&#8221; If that isn’t a synchronicity, then I’m a mozzarella ball.</p></blockquote>

<p>I thought if Tumblr was good enough to meet Felix&#39;s quite stringent standards I figured I might as well give it a shot myself. As I eventually found out with services like del.icio.us, Flickr, Twitter and Truemors, I don&#39;t feel as though I have much of a use for it now, but it might grow on me. Actually come to think of it then, maybe I shouldn&#39;t start another addiction!</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/help">Tumblr Help page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>To make a simple analogy: If blogs are journals, tumblelogs are scrapbooks.</p>
<p>You can also look at tumblelogs as slightly more structured blogs that make it easier, faster, and more fun to post and share stuff you find or create.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the time being I&#39;ve just got my own Tumblr literally posting directly from my Flickr, del.icio.us, Rubenerd Show and Rubenerd Blog web feeds. I also post random quotes that I find, because one line posts wouldn&#39;t really be that appropriate on a site like this, plus doggone it I really like quotes.</p>

<p>My Tumblr can be found at <a href="http://rubenerd.tumblr.com/">rubenerd.tumblr.com</a>, and Felix&#39;s is at <a href="http://ftanjono.tumblr.com/">ftanjono.tumblr.com.</a></p>
