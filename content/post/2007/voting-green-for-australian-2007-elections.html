<p>I just came back from the Australian High Commission on Napier Rd here in Singapore after casting my vote in the 2007 Australian federal elections!</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t know much about Australian politics, John Howard of the <a href="http://www.liberal.org.au/">Liberal party</a> (liberal doesn&#39;t mean the same thing here as it does in the United States, the Liberal party is &quot;conservative&quot;) has been in power for over a decade now and basically acted like George W. Bush&#39;s other sidekick on most things such as the Iraq war, rejecting the Kyoto protocol, backwards views on immigration and native Australians, not to mention various scandalsâ€¦ and the fact he has no charisma at all which is very embarrassing when he goes overseas!</p>
<p>The other major party is the <a href="http://www.alp.org.au/">Labor party</a> which shares many things in common with Labour in the UK. The leader Kevin Rudd seems to have his head screwed on a lot better than Howard <strong>especially when it comes to education and technology</strong>, so I voted for Labor #2.</p>
<p>But as usual I voted for <a href="http://www.greens.org.au/">The Greens</a> as number 1, headed by Senator Bob Brown. Ever since the Democrats have faded from relevancy The Greens have been a vocal minority. Some of their stances on issues are obviously quite controversial, but I find myself agreeing with everything they do. It&#39;s like voting without your conscience getting pissed off at you for voting for the <strong>lesser of two evils</strong> when you vote Coalition or Labor.</p>
<p>And there ends my coverage of the Australian 2007 federal elections. All contained in one post, not bad right?</p>
