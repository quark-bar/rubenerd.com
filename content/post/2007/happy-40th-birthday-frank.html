<p>Frank Edward Nora of <a href="http://theovernightscape.com/">The Overnightscape</a> and ons on Twitter turns 40 today, and I wanted to write something here that would do this monuments occasion justice.</p>
<p>In the midst of considering how I would somehow use lasers to etch a greeting onto an obscure astronomical formation that he would be able to see on the other side of the planet, <a href="http://twitter.com/ons/">a cool person referred me on Twitter</a> to a <a href="fonts101.com/xt_randomizer.asp">randomised font generator page</a>!</p>
