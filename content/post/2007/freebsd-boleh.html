<p>Very quiet night tonight with just my bed-stricken mum and I at home. She&#39;s in a lot of pain tonight. If only there were some way I could take some of that pain away from her.</p>
<p>Anyways onto some fun stuff; I was thinking of things I could do at home on a Saturday night. FreeBSD! I need to update my ports collection a bit more often… the <code>portmanager -u</code> update is going to be a big one this time! Shows though how little maintenance you need to keep a FreeBSD system running just nice.</p>

<p><a href="//rubenerd.com/category/bsd/"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/bsd_daemon.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 10px 20px" alt="Beastie!" /></a>As I was watching my local repository of free goodies update itself without me needing to do anything I got to thinking: damn it, I just love FreeBSD! Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Beastie! &#8594;</li>
<li>one official package management system</li>
<li>one official ports collection</li>
<li>one well written, master, last word handbook</li>
<li>one source for official documentation</li>
<li>one base website</li>
<li>one predictable, rigid and enforced root drive folder layout</li>
<li>one base kernel from the same folks who develop the other system components</li>
<li>ease of setting up X11 to make a kick-arse desktop</li>
<li>speed in which it starts up compared to Linux</li>
<li>nice BSD licence…</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>It&#39;s all just so cohesive and efficient damn it!</strong> Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still think <a href="http://debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> is all good and Mac OS X is still spiffy, but FreeBSD rocks!</p>
<p>Anyway it&#39;s getting damned late and I need to <code><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=shutdown">shutdown -p now</a></code> myself, if you know what I mean ;).</p>
