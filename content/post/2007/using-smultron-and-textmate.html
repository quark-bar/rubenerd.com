<p><a href="http://smultron.sourceforge.net/">Smultron</a> is an open source text editor for Mac OS X written by Peter Borg, and I must say I&#39;m impressed with it. Simple code editing on individual files is a snap, and the sidebar is much more elegant than an entire row of confusing tabs.</p>
<p>I&#39;m currently a <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> on my MacBook Pro user mainly because of convenience. For one thing the projects are easy to set up and are in XML (which I&#39;ve been told I have a borderline perverse obsession with), and from one Bundles menu I can select the language I&#39;m coding in and I have all the actions and properties I need. Smultron does have Project like functionality, and it does have a code colouring menu which actually supports far more syntax rules than TextMate, but it doesn&#39;t have the other functionality for individual languages.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair though to compare TextMate and Smultron head on, because I use them for different things. Editing individual text files which have little in common with each other is obviously easier in Smultron because of TextMate&#39;s maddening lack of tab support for files that aren&#39;t a part of the same project, but TextMate is more useful for managing entire projects, such as Ruby on Rails site or a graphical Java Swing programme. If you&#39;ve used Mac OS X for a while, I like to think of TextMate as a replacement for <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/xcode/">Xcode</a>, and Smultron as a replacement for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit">TextEdit</a>. Sort of.</p>
<p>From a polish point of view, TextMate&#39;s icons are certainly much slicker than Smultron&#39;s default ones, though Gaetan Ark <a href="http://www.forrestwalter.com/temp/smultron-icons/">has released the original icons for Smultron he designed as a separate file</a> you can use to patch your Smultron.app file.</p>
<p>Like a true open source gentleman Peter doesn&#39;t ask outright for money, but he does have a donation page if you find his program useful. When I get my POSB MasterCard thingy I&#39;ll definably put some <em>bread in the jar</em>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Joel">Even though I&#39;m not a Piano Man</a>.</p>
<p>Some basic screenshots of some crappy Ruby and Perl scripts I whipped up to demonstrate the syntax support. Ignore the date, as of May I&#39;m still typing 2006 on everything.</p>
