<p>Dave Winer over at <a href="http://scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> has suggested an addition to this <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> micro blogging phenomenon: Twittergrams! The idea is to record messages with a limited number of words which would be the natural progression we saw from blogs to podcasting. I posted a response <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenerd/">on my Twitter page</a>, or <a href="//rubenerd.com/ResponseToDaveWiner.mp3">you can listen here</a>.</p>
<p>I think <strong>micropodcasting</strong> sounds sexier though. And what&#39;s there to stop us in the future making micro videocasts? You could be at a restaurant and do a quick food review on your camera phone, or record a quick message out the front of the Merlion in Singapore or the Eiffel tower, a modern day video Twitter &quot;wish you were here&quot; message.</p>
<p>Once again, I think Dave has really stumbled upon something interesting here. Not that he&#39;s ever taken the time to reply to anything I&#39;ve ever said ;-).</p>
