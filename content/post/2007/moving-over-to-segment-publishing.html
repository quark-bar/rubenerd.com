<p>Today it&#39;s official, I&#39;m moving over all my internet paraphernalia to <a href="http://segpub.com.au/">Segment Publishing</a>, a web hosting company in my birth city of Sydney in Australia!</p>
<p><a href="http://segpub.com.au/"><img src='//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/segpub.png' alt='Segment Publishing' /></a></p>
<p>Unlike every other web host I&#39;ve done business with in the past, Segpub give you full SSH access to your home account, secure FTP, they give you your own unique IP address, their logo is a kawaii face… how could I refuse? But probably the two most striking features that drew me to them was the fact they run FreeBSD which just thrills my socks off, and… they&#39;re not <a href="http://servage.net/">Servage</a>. That last point in particular was very important.</p>
<h3>Servage… didn’t</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re one to revel in <em>Schadenfreude</em> you would have loved reading my woes with my current web host over this last year, especially my latest experience with my MySQL tables being down <a href="//rubenerd.com/servage-takes-site-offline-for-3-days/">for a whopping 4 days</a>!</p>
<p>I figured that disaster plus the 2 cumulative days in total from the rest of the year (a conservative estimate, I&#39;m sure it was more) puts the total uptime for 2007 for the <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">Rubenerd Show</a> and <a href="//rubenerd.com/">Rubenerd Blog</a> to 98.63%, a far cry <a href="http://www.servage.net/page/features/">from their stated 99.98%</a>. That said in either case I wouldn&#39;t have minded so much had they either given me some form of warning or maybe even a discount for the times they weren&#39;t able to provide service for the reason of the month.</p>
<p>Their &quot;intermittently reliable&quot; physical service is a shame because their technical support system is excellent. Support tickets I submitted never took more than a day to answer, and they always seemed happy to elaborate and explain points further when I replied asking for clarification.</p>
<p>Ironically the day I registered with Segpub on the 07th, <a href="http://www.servage.net/show/index2.php?menuHeader=9&#038;menuSub=56&#038;page=show_news&#038;news_id=70">Servage upgraded the design of their site and added new features</a>. Go figure.</p>
<h3>The move is on!</h3>

<p>So by the end of this week this whole mess of a site will be lifted up and moved over to Segpub. I&#39;m taking the opportunity to clean out my <code>public_html</code> folder while I&#39;m at it. There are so many orphaned files and old Perl scripts from previous projects that are all just begging to be spring cleaned.</p>
