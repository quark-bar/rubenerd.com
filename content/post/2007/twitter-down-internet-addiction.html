<p>I guess this is what you get when you live on the other side of the planet from the web service you&#39;re maniacally addicted to: they take their site down for maintenance during their night time, which for us here in Asia Pacific is the early afternoon!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/1334805112/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1214/1334805112_00f14a2af1.jpg" width="500" height="313" alt="Oh no: Twitter outage!" /></a></p>
<p>I can remember back a few years ago when I wanted everything hosted on my own website with <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">my own software</a> so I would only be dependent on the web host I was on at the time, and that&#39;s it. Now I have <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenerd/">Twitter</a> (and <a href="//rubenerd.com.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> feeding off that), <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/rubenerd">del.icio.us</a>â€¦ not to mention my Google calendars, documents and search history. It&#39;s actually mildly scary when I think about it; I don&#39;t care about the privacy concerns (yet), I&#39;m more worried about my important data being spread all over the place on so many different services, any of which could disappear at any time.</p>
<p>Or maybe I&#39;m just having the inevitable Twitter withdrawal jitters. It&#39;s very hard to tell at this stage. I think I need a very stiff, black cup of coffee!</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><strong>SIDENOTE</strong> I had no idea how useful <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/sets/72157601891669013/">Flickr is for screenshots</a> as well as photos. Previously I would have to take the screenshot, convert it to PNG and a scaled down JPG, upload both to my server and link them up. With Flickr I just have to upload the master and it does all the heavy lifting, very nice.</span></p>
