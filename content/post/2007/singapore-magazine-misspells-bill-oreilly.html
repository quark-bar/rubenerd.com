<p>I finally caved and re-registered my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/">Pro Flickr</a> account. My experiment with <a href="http://zooomr.com/photos/rubenerd/">Zooomr</a> was fun, but Flickr is way more reliable and still easier to use. The <q>smart sets</q> feature in Zooomr which can create sets automatically based on tags is nice, but often backfired so I couldn&#39;t use it seriously.</p>
<p>So to celebrate my return to the Flickr realm, I&#39;ve posted a VERY funny picture in the Singapore StarHub cable TV guide for this month!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/1294327989/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1294/1294327989_1c478240c7.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Singapore magazine misspells Bill O'Reilly!" /></a></p>
<p>That&#39;s right, they called him NILL O&#39;Reilly! He&#39;s nothing, his opinions are worthless, he&#39;s NILL!</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have the pleasure of knowing who Bill O&#39;Reilly is, he&#39;s a self confessed &quot;traditionalist&quot; who tries to seek the truth &quot;without spin&quot; but is in reality a loud conservative pundit who yanks the microphones &#8211; and screams over the top of &#8211; people he disagrees with. Very entertaining television if you don&#39;t take him seriously.</p>
<p>But now he&#39;s being shown in Singapore? Argh where&#39;s Keith Olbermann when you need him?</p>
