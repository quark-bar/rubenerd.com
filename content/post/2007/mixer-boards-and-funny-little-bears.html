<p>I&#39;m no closer to finding my mixer board. I could have sworn I put it in the box we took back to KL in the car instead of the removalists boxing it up, but I have a sinking feeling the removalists took it after all.</p>
<p>If I can&#39;t find it amongst all the crap we brought with us, I might have to record the show with just a microphone plugged into the laptop instead. No MadPlayer or interviews for a few weeks :(. I&#39;m still looking though, and as a sign that it is possible to find things while rummaging through a bag I found my little bear with the Selangor flag shirt. Haha, I forgot where I got the fella :D.</p>
<p>Eeeeee, it&#39;s a friggen mixer board, how hard can it be to find? Aiyo.</p>
