<p>I just got a tweet on Twitterrific from Frank Nora that today (11th August) is the last day to vote for your favourite podcasts on <a href="http://PodCastAwards.com/">PodCastAwards.com</a>, so don&#39;t forget to click on your favourite shows. If you&#39;re in my part of the world you have until late Sunday morning (12th August).</p>

<p>I&#39;ve voted for <a href="http://theovernightscape.com">The Overnightscape</a> (obviously!) every time under <em>General</em> and alternated between <a href="http://www.twit.tv/mbw">MacBreak Weekly</a> and <a href="http://www.twit.tv/SN">Security Now</a> (<a href="http://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm">GRC link</a>) under <em>Computing</em>. I couldn&#39;t decide between the two so I figured I&#39;d vote for both.</p>
<p>I was disappointed <a href="http://crankygeeks.com/">Cranky Geeks</a> wasn&#39;t nominated in the <em>Video</em> category, and neither <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/tvradio/podcast/ontheeconomy.html">On the Economy with Tom Keene</a> nor <a href="http://eurekareport.com.au/iis/iis.nsf/pages/EurekaPodcast?OpenDocument">Alan Kohler&#39;s Eureka Report</a> were nominated under <em>Business</em>. Ah well, can&#39;t win them all.</p>
