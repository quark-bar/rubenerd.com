<p>The DFE-670TXD is a mysterious little ethernet card, because it&#39;s turned my old ThinkPad 600E into a very picky eater. With this card plugged into either of the PC Card slots:</p>
<ul>
<li>My beloved <strong><a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a></strong> installs, but throws errors upon booting despite the fact the very card is named and supported in <code>/etc/defaults/pccard.conf</code></li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a></strong> not only refuses to install, but just reboots the machine before it’s even finished booting of the CD-ROM</li>
<li>My Linux distro of choice <strong><a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a></strong> detects and installs the card, but upon using it after installing the base system, the entire system hangs forcing a hard reset</li>
</ul>
<p>Curiously, the <strong>only</strong> operating system which installed and detected the card perfectly was… <strong><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a></strong>! I have no idea what OpenBSD is doing differently, but booting of the CD and going through the installer the card is detected automatically. When I reboot the machine with OpenBSD installed, I can use the internet, share files on the local network and synchronise with time servers <strong>without any problems!</strong></p>
<p>FreeBSD is my operating system of choice generally, but OpenBSD for some reason which completely baffles me right now is the only one that works. I&#39;m completely baffled. Did I mentioned I&#39;m baffled? Bamboozled? Anyone with knowledge on how OpenBSD drivers work know why or have any theories?</p>
<p>In any case I guess I&#39;d better brush up on the OpenBSD FAQs, because I have an OpenBSD machine now!</p>
