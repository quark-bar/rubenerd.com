<p>Despite the availability of an official build of <a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a> for Mac OS X I&#39;ve always liked and preferred using <a href="http://caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a>, not because it shares it&#39;s name with a liqueur, but because it uses Aqua instead of Mozilla&#39;s standard user interface. This means it&#39;s noticeably zippier when running and starting up, the binary is much smaller and the design matches all my other Mac programmes. As Mark Shuttleworth, the South African behind <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu Linux</a> and the first African in space so famously put it: <q><a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=2931525">Pretty is a feature!</a></q></p>
<p>That said I&#39;ve been a user of <a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/products/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> for a long time, mostly for future proofing reasons. Because it&#39;s open source and the data files it generates are also readable on other platforms it just made me feel more comfortable. I&#39;m always imagining a scenario in the future where I switch over to Linux or FreeBSD full time; I would <strong>hate</strong> to move across all that data.</p>
<p>With all the work I have these days it&#39;s so liberating when a piece of software comes out that just makes life simplerâ€¦ and look better. Am I right?</p>
<p>In this case I stumbled upon a new email client for Mac OS X called <a href="http://www.nkreeger.com/correo/">Correo</a>. It&#39;s at a fairly rudimentary stage right now but it&#39;s fun to tinker around with. I can&#39;t wait for it to be really fleshed out.</p>
