<p>We may be starting to see the introduction of ads on Twitter. Around 22:00, we all saw a link for the MTV Twitter account on the site’s sidebar.</p>
<p>On most sites, this wouldn’t be such a big deal. On Twitter though, we have a different situation. If MTV were really something Twitter users were interested in, wouldn’t people have just tweeted about it?</p>
<p>I suppose Twitter have to make money somehow. But MTV, really? Who cares?</p>
