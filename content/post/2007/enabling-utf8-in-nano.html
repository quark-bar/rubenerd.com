<p>Everyone knows that vi and vim are better than emacs right? Well personally I prefer nano even over vi. It was the first text editor I ever learned (okay it was actually pico, the editor it was cloned from) on UNIX and even now I use it for almost everything: Ruby, Perl, HTML, XML, KitchenSinkâ€¦ even these weblog posts. It&#39;s a small world, so why not use a small editor? Hey, that&#39;s catchy.</p>
<p>The problem though if you install Nano from <a href="http://macports.org/">MacPorts</a> is that it&#39;s not enabled with a number of what I would consider critical features. Aside from syntax highlighting support probably the most noticeable of which is the lack of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a> support which means it spits out a series of question marks whenever you&#39;re editing files with katakana, kanji and kitchen-sink in it for example. Bummer.</p>
<p>A cursory glance over at the <a href="http://darwinports.com/">DarwinPorts</a> website shows that in fact it&#39;s possible to <a href="http://nano.darwinports.com/">enable UTF-8</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Variant: utf8 {<br />
configure.args-append &#8211;enable-utf8<br />
configure.args-delete &#8211;disable-utf8<br />
depends_lib-append port:ncursesw<br />
depends_lib-delete port:ncurses<br />
}
</p></blockquote>
<p>The key is simply to add <code>+utf8</code> when you initially build the port, along with any other conditions you think are spiffy:</p>
<pre>sudo port -v install nano +utf8 +color +no_wrap</pre>
