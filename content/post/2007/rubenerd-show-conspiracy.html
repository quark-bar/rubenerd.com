<p>Actually there&#39;s no conspiracy here, but I did do a uncharacteristically thought out and half serious (okay, maybe a quarter serious!) <a href="//rubenerd.comshow.com/archives/show231/">episode of the Rubenerd Show</a> and I needed a image to go with it that looked mysterious and evil.</p>
<p><a href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/ConspiracyTheoryRubenerdShowImage.jpg"><img src="//rubenerd.comshow.com/shows/images/231.conspiracy.jpg" alt="Evil and mysterious?" style="width:320px;height:240px" /></a></p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it worked, but you&#39;ve got to love <a href="//rubenerd.com/pointless-photobooth-at-0200/">Photo Booth</a>!</p>
