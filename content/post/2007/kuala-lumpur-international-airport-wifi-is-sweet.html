<p>So I was at the <a href="http://klia.com.my/">Kuala Lumpur International Airport</a> (KLIA to people in the know) for a long drawn out reason which I won&#39;t attempt to explain here, and I found myself trying their <em>free</em> WiFi access. Given my experience with TMNet&#39;s WiFi at the Starbucks coffee shops here I was a bit sceptical about how good it was going to be. As it turns out it was faster than out DSL at home in Gita Bayu!</p>
<p>As you would know if you read this site in any manner resembling regularity I love screenshots, so here are some from my WiFi adventures :D.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the initial welcome screen when I logged on for free on my MacBook Pro:</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the welcome screen when I booted into Haruhi KDE FreeBSD ;):</p>

<p>And what better thing to do on free WiFi network in a Malaysian airport but listen to <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/">Whole Wheat Radio?</a></p>
