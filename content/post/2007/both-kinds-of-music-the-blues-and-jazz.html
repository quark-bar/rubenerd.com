<p>So today was a pretty dreadful as days go. I walked into my mums room this afternoon to see her face turning red and sweating; she couldn&#39;t breathe. So we got into a taxi and after one of the wildest traffic weaving adventures I think any of us have ever had we got to the hospital and had her admitted into the overnight care wing. She&#39;s okay now thank goodness, bit of a scare, but the nurses there are all really friendly and I&#39;m positive she&#39;s in capable hands.</p>
<p>Anyway so this evening sitting back home my sister and I were feeling depressed, as you can no doubt imagine!</p>
<p>Now I&#39;ve found myself getting more and more into Jazz and especially in the last few years, especially with artists like <a href="wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Artists:Kevin_So">Kevin So</a> and Chick Corea with their clean sounds, the huge volumes of Latin Jazz my dad has picked up on his business trips to South America and of course the <a href="//rubenerd.com/michaelfranks/">Official Rubenerd Greatest Artist of All Time: Michael Franks</a>.</p>

<p>But we needed something else today as well, so I whipped out some Eric Clapton, B.B. King, the Blues Brothers, Sam and Dave, Terry Callier… and a whole pile of other stuff. I love it!</p>

<p>Then it got me thinking: I looked at all the mountains of music I&#39;ve accumulated over the years on my various playlists, and I have far fewer pop and &quot;Billboard Top&quot; and &quot;MTV&quot; and all that stuff than I thought. Am I turning into a music snob already? 10 years from now when I&#39;m in my thirties will I be rocking in a chair talking to my kids about the &quot;horrible&quot; music they&#39;re playing on the radio? Heck that&#39;s what I think about most of it now!</p>

<p>Dang I need to unpack my mixer board ASAP, this is great rant material for a Rubenerd Show right here :).</p>
<p>Oh god… I have more J-Pop than western pop… oh god… I didn&#39;t see that coming.</p>
