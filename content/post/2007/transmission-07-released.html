<p>My favourite <a href="http://transmission.m0k.org">bittorrent client</a> has been bumped up to version 0.7. Dont forget to <a href="http://digg.com/software/Transmission_0_70_Released">Digg it</a> if you use that. Personally I can&#39;t stand Digg, but that&#39;s just me ;).</p>
<p>This is what I said about it <a href="http://rubenerd.com/transmission-bittorrent-client/">early in March 2006</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve been looking around for a small, lightweight Bittorrent client for Mac OS X. So far I used the vanilla Bittorrent client and Azureus on the Mac and was fairly impressed, but the vanilla client was pretty… vanilla, and Azureus uses so many system resources! I guess because it’s Java and not a true Cocoa program.</p>
<p>I tried Transmission (<a href="http://transmission.m0k.org">http://transmission.m0k.org/</a>) and was really impressed. It’s only 300 kilobytes in size (VERY refreshing after downloading Azureus!) and because it’s a native Cocoa.app it works brilliantly, even on my ageing iBook G3 machine.</p></blockquote>
<p>From what I can tell after using it so far the program looks much more polished, the colours are more professional and the new &quot;Minimal Layout&quot; makes it much easier to view when you have stacks of transfers going.</p>

<p>The new features in the Mac version according to the forum post:</p>
<ul>
<li>New icon</li>
<li>Automatic port mapping (NAT-PMP and UPnP IGD)</li>
<li>Peer exchange (PEX) compatible with Azureus and uTorrent</li>
<li>Multitracker support</li>
<li>Better handling of tracker announce interval</li>
<li>Fixes bug where absurdly huge upload/download totals could be sent</li>
<li>Automatic tracker scraping</li>
<li>Cache connected peers</li>
<li>Many miscellaneous bugfixes and small improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>And I do like the new icon :)</p>
