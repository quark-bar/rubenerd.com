<p>If you don&#39;t really follow many internet trends, <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenerd/">Twitter</a> and <a href="//rubenerd.com.jaiku.com">Jaiku</a> are two painfully hip services that allow you to post exactly what you&#39;re doing and where you&#39;re located at any given time. It&#39;s a very simple formula that seems to be all the rage at the moment, and I admit I&#39;m hooked!</p>
<p>I learned about Twitter from my very smart friend <a href="http://twitter.com/redragon">Feeeeeeeeeeeelix</a> and have been using it for about a month. I think the mix of a clean and easy to read homepage mixed with the <a href="//rubenerd.com/twitterrific-20-is-slick/">Twitterrific for Mac</a> client I reviewed yesterday makes it a very nice distraction, plus I&#39;ve been added by some <a href="http://thewrongadvices.com/">interesting people</a> and can keep up to date <a href="http://twitter.com/Beracahvalley">with their shenanigans</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway reading <a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Scripting News</a> this morning and looking through my unread tweets I read that Dave Winer has got himself a Jaiku account. At first I rolled my eyes at the prospect of another website that I thought obviously was just riding the wave and shamelessly copying, but while the two services have a similar basic premise (aka: post what you&#39;re doing) they have radically different features, and I consider my initial position officially debunked!</p>
<p>From what I can tell Jaiku seems to be an aggregator for Web 2.0 goodness as well, so whenever one of my RSS/Atom/KitchenSink feeds is updated somewhere (post a comment on my blog, post a new show, upload a photo or bookmark something) it will be posted on my Jaiku page. Ironically I can even use this feature to subscribe to my Twitter account, continue to post on it and have my tweets routed to Jaiku as well, until I can decide which to use full time. Argh!</p>
<p>The other advantage of Jaiku is the commenting feature, with one click you can view all the comments for a particular post. I posted two messages and had half a dozen replies to each within an hour, crazy!</p>

<p>Who needs MySpace when you have these slick services I ask you now? Really makes me think though how dependent I really am on Web 2.0 stuff, and it seemed to happen so gradually I didn&#39;t see it coming, crazy!</p>
<p>Seem to have said &quot;crazy&quot; a lot on this post. Crazy.</p>
