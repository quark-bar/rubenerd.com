<p><span style="text-decoration:line-through">Happy Vanentine&#39;s</span> Singles Awareness Day everyone. Yes, much more politically correct lah!</p>
<p><img id="image656" src="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/haruhikyon.jpg" alt="haruhikyon.jpg" /></p>
<p>On to other matters though, it seems the situation at home has become a <strong><em>bit</em></strong> more stable now, so I&#39;m looking forward to creating the Rubenerd Show again starting later this week. Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
<p>As usual I&#39;d like to thank Felix, <a href="http://davesphotogallery.net/">Dave</a>, <a href="http://radiofreeporty.org/">Matt</a>, <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/windows-vista-yawn-xfce-440-is-out/">Bird/Liz/Elizabeth/Something</a>, Ruth, <a href="http://www.wholewheatradio.org/User:Jimbob">Jimbob</a> and of course <em>you</em> for the support you&#39;ve given my family and I over these last few weeks.</p>
<p>At the expense of possibly up-to-the-minute stories and so forth; I&#39;ll be resuming the recording by doing shows a few days in advance to give myself some buffer space. Ideally I&#39;d love to do shows a week in advance <span style="text-decoration:line-through">in case</span> when something else happens but for the time being that seems a bit silly. I am still determined to do weekdaily shows instead of a weekend one though!</p>
