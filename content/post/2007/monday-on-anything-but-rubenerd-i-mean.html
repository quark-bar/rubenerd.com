<p>As of today I&#39;ve been offered a part in the next <a href="http://www.abmshow.com/">Anything but Monday</a> show, the podcast by Frank Edward Nora and Mad Mike Masters through one of their Skypecasts. Booh yah!</p>
<p>I reviewed the Anything but Monday programme on <a href="//rubenerd.comshow.com/archive/rubenerdshow221">Rubenerd Show 221</a> on Monday (I thought it an appropriate day of the week), and I posted regarding the dilemma I faced with paying for it back on the <a href="//rubenerd.com/anything-but-monday-show/">21st of February</a>.</p>
<p>As a sign of thanks Frank even gave me an Anything but Monday present as well! Here&#39;s hoping I won&#39;t be verbally torn to shreds by Mad Mike for my Kuala Lumpur comment retaliation :D.</p>
<p>Space this watch, um, watch this space.</p>
