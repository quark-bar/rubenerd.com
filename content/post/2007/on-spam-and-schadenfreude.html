<p>For what seems like an age I&#39;ve been receiving email newsletters from the so-called &quot;Center for Freedom and Prosperity Foundation&quot;. They added me to their email list; I didn&#39;t subscribe to them; and they don&#39;t provide any way to opt out. Repeated messages to them to unsubscribe me from their list were always ignored.</p>
<blockquote class="aside"><p>ASIDE: I probably paid a price for replying, which verified my address and allowed them to continue spamming me. The power of hindsight!</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately they <strong>finally slipped up</strong> and provided a link to a YouTube video they&#39;re working on. From their latest email message that landed in my spam folder:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dear Friends,</p>
<p>The Center for Freedom and Prosperity Foundation has a polished draft of our new &#8220;Tax Competition&#8221; video. Thanks to all the helpful comments we received on our &#8220;Corporate Tax Rate&#8221; video, I hope our new video is an even better product. It’s one minute shorter and was used a professional filming facility, but we’ve also worked on making the message more compelling.</p>
<p>I’m hoping you can be part of our final filter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This was a slip up because YouTube allows publicly viewable comments that they can&#39;t filter out. So I posted a quick response which I&#39;m sure won&#39;t get me off their spam list, but at least I can warn others… and plus it just feels good finally getting a message to them they can&#39;t just block out!</p>

<blockquote><p>
These people subscribed me to their email newsletters without my permission and do not provide a way to opt out. I have to create a separate filter in all my email clients specially for their junk.</p>
<p>Even ignoring their flawed economic logic, the simple fact of the matter is they’re nothing but SPAMMERS. Don’t give them any of your time.

<p>I&#39;m not linking to their site or their video so I&#39;m not giving them free Google juice, but I&#39;m sure you could find them by doing a quick internet search… if you really wanted to find them!</p>
<p>Does this count as <strong>Schadenfreude</strong>? Is there such as thing as <strong>justified Schadenfreude</strong>? :-D</p>
