<p>I did a clean install of my MacBook Pro yesterday and did a software update. All the software, firmware and whatnot are the latest versions.</p>
<p>But joy of joys, the latest version of iTunes 7.3.2 has been giving me nothing but grief. It&#39;s the first Mac OS X application in five years that I haven&#39;t been able to <em>Force Quit</em>, or kill in either the <em>Activity Monitor</em> or by looking up it&#39;s <em>PID in top</em> in the Terminal and typing <em>kill PID</em>. Nothing. Nada.</p>
<p>That said though, it looks like I&#39;m <a href="http://discussions.apple.com/thread.jspa?threadID=1079422">not the only one with this problem</a>.</p>
<p>So now I know what Mai was angry about at the <a href="//rubenerd.com/modular-xorg-on-netbsd-from-scratch/">end of that last post</a>â€¦</p>
