<p>So I was looking for some Creative Commons licenced photos of Fraser&#39;s Hill using <a href="http://images.google.com.my/images?hl=en&#038;q=fraser%27s+hill&#038;btnG=Search+Images">Google Image</a> search this morning when I noticed something a bit different about it. From what I can tell they&#39;ve adopted their <a href="http://searchmash.com/">SearchMash</a> testing project&#39;s minimalist image search layout by removing all traces of information about images other than their filename. To get the image details you need to hover over each image.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a screenshot taken a few minutes ago in <a href="http://hmdt-web.net/shiira/en">Shiira</a> on my MacBook Pro:</p>
<p><a href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.googleimages_mac.png"><img id="image632" src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/googleimages_mac_thumb.png" alt="Google Image search on Shiira" /></a></p>
<p>This is no good lah! I use Google Image search all the time and have come to appreciate the fact I can quickly glance at the page of thumbnails and only click on the ones that are in the resolution I need.</p>
<p>Fortunately Konqueror on KDE still seems unaffected by the change… so far! Probably an AJAX reason or something:</p>
