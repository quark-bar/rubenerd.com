<p>A couple of days ago I finally gave in and purchased a copy of <a href="http://vmware.com/mac/">VMware Fusion</a>. Having used the demo versions of <a href="http://parallels.com/">Parallels Desktop</a> and Fusion on my <a href="http://apple.com.sg/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> I decided VMware&#39;s product was much more suited to my needs. Parallels seems to be great for running Windows, but my main use is for FreeBSD and other Unix-like development which Fusion has better native support for (official additions for <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> and <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/">Solaris</a> anyone?). And with a special offer of $39.00 for first time beta purchases before the final version came out I figured it was the best choice. <em>I should have taken a PR course at university instead</em>.</p>
<p>So now I have the final, official retail release of VMware Fusion running on my MacBook Pro, and I&#39;m loving it. Having a dual core processor with <a href="http://www.intel.com/technology/platform-technology/virtualization/index.htm">VT</a> support really kicks some serious virtual arse.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot of fresh virtual machines running <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD 4.1</a> sitting at the shell, <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD 3.1</a> with a basic <a href="http://icculus.org/openbox/index.php/Main_Page">OpenBox window manager</a> session, <a href="http://reactos.org/">ReactOS</a> and an installation of <a href="http://microsoft.com/windows2000/">Windows 2000 Professional</a> humming along:</p>

<p>I do admit I do run a purchased, fully licenced copy of Windows 2000 as a virtual machine to run a few apps that don&#39;t work so well on Wine, and for testing of my websites using <a href="http://mozilla.com/firefox/">Internet Explorer 6</a>. Windows XP and Vista just add useless features and require more system resources, so 2000 works just nice. Well, as nice as Windows can.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot of AutoPatcher running under Windows 2000 using the Unity feature of Fusion which makes it look as though Windows applications are running on the Mac OS X desktop. I much prefer to use AutoPatcher than Windows Update because it means I don&#39;t have to run Internet Explorer to use it, and I don&#39;t call home to Microsoft.</p>

<p>And here it is running in it&#39;s own window. I actually think I prefer having it this way:</p>

<p>I just love having virtual machines. I can tinker away with really fascinating operating systems and learn so much, without stuffing up anything when I do something wrong. It&#39;s great for sand boxing, and it also allows me to run a scaled down FreeBSD machine with just the bare basics so I can study without distractions. Not to mention compiling applications for different platformsâ€¦ the possibilities are so exciting!</p>
<p>Or maybe I&#39;m just easily excited ;).</p>
