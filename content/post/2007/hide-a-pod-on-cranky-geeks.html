<p>This has already <a href="http://digg.com/apple/The_ultimate_iPod_anti_theft_device_Hide_it_in_a_Zune">has had its time on Digg</a> and has appeared on <a href="http://twit.tv">at least three podcasts</a> I listen to, but I still get a kick out of it and most people here in Singapore haven&#39;t seen it (I&#39;m sure Felix has!) so I have to mention it here for fun: The Hide-a-pod!</p>
<blockquote><p>You love your iPod. Itâ€™s a great product. You take it everywhere and you use it every day. But owning a device so desirable and fashionable as an iPod comes with one major drawback . . . the iPod has become a target for theft. So how can you take your iPod out of your home without fear?</p></blockquote>
<p>The way the case protects your iPod or iPhone is by disguising it as a brown <a href="http://zune.net/">Microsoft Zune</a>, something nobody would want :).</p>

<p>The best coverage I heard of it was of course on <a href="http://www.crankygeeks.com/2007/07/episode_73_illegal_data_collec.php">Cranky Geeks 073</a> where they discussed one possible flaw: nobody actually carries a Zune, so the incidence of theft may increase as criminals think of Zunes as merely cases that contain something more valuable! One of my favourite episodes, even though it didn&#39;t have Sebastian Rupley or spiffy segues ;).</p>
<p>In a way I feel sorry for Microsoft, they obviously at least tried to come up with their own &quot;tragically hip&quot; media player experience but it fell on it&#39;s portable electronic arse. I wonder if this will be lumped together in the same Microsoft product graveyard years from now along with Windows Me, Microsoft Bob and Clippy?</p>
<p>Anyway you can purchase a DRM-free Hide-a-pod at their <a href="http://hideapod.com/order/">totally legit ordering page</a>.</p>
