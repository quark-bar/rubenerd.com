<p><em>EDIT: I just realised that the draft version (without any links) of this post was the one that was published, not the final one. It&#39;s been all fixed up.</em></p>
<p>With all the talk these days about online word processors such as <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Documents</a> and <a href="http://www.goffice.com/">gOffice</a> replacing traditional client installed office suites such as <a href="http://openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a>, it got me thinking: do more technically inclined computers users actually need word processors <em>at all</em> anymore?</p>
<p>Think about it: if you&#39;re a web programmer or have any experience in HTML (preferably one of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/#xhtml11">XHTML</a> varieties) and CSS you have everything you need to create a professional looking document, and as I discovered, it takes a lot less effort.</p>
<p>With any word processor I&#39;ve ever used I&#39;ve always found it to be a struggle to use the inbuilt templates and formats for headings, lists and so forth. With HTML I have complete control over what everything looks like and where everything goes, I can change the entire formatting of a document on the fly, and the resulting document (if done correctly) is a standards based file which can be read on virtually any computer with a simple web browser, and it&#39;s in a format which I know many years from now I will still be able to open and access, I can embed <a href="http://microformats.org/">microformats</a> such as <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCards</a> into my documents (very useful for letters), I can create different stylesheets for screen and print views, I can use easily edited meta tags to denote the copyright, language, date, author, keywords, owner and description of a documentâ€¦ the list goes on.</p>
<p>Now granted there could be some downsides depending on who you are. Some people might find the use of &lt;tags /&gt; to be cumbersome and annoying, and I certainly don&#39;t expect everyone to pick it up, but if you have the experience it can work out to be a very efficient and quick way to type something up.</p>
<p>And the best part of it all? You don&#39;t need a fancy word processing programme with bucket loads of features you&#39;ll never use: all you need is a lightweight text editor, and maybe a PDF exporting programme to help with creating separate, printable pages if you run a flavour of Windows.</p>
<p>So how do I use HTML to create documents? Argh, two rhetorical questions in the one post. This is no good. I now have a file called <code>master.html</code> sitting in my home directory that I use as a template for new documents; I simply copy the file, change the meta data and write up the document.</p>
