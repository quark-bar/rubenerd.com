<em>Picture is of Ruth (right) and I (left) in the AIS high school common room, 2004. My facial expression was a result of having a nasty cold. My hair… I can&#39;t explain.</em></p>
<p>Got an email today from a Singapore high school friend of mine, Ruthie Mazengarb! <em>Munt!</em> Ruth came to our school in year 11 I think, was one of the nicest, funniest, nicest (I think I said that already) people I ever met, and let&#39;s just say I had a but of crush on her too. Ahem.</p>
<p>She&#39;s doing great down there in New Zealand, just about to start her 3rd year of a Social Work degree, a real thrill to hear. She&#39;s exactly the kind of person you would want working with people. That didn&#39;t come out right, but you get the jist.</p>
<p>But possibly the second best thing of all after the fact I heard from her? I&#39;ve got her to ditch Windows!</p>
<blockquote><p>You will be pleased to know I have a Mac (ibook) the baby/smallest one…..I remember your comments at school that always put Macs above Microsoft and PC, now, i do actually understand what you where on about, and think Macs rock too!</p></blockquote>
<p>Is good lah, bagus!</p>
<p>It&#39;s amazing that I have several slow weeks in my email inbox (I don&#39;t count work on university correspondence!), but just in the last week I&#39;ve <strong><em>met three new people</em></strong> and <strong><em>caught up with four others</em></strong>!</p>
