<p>It was another one of those &quot;I knew it wouldn&#39;t work but I was hoping it would&quot; kind of situations. Amazon has released a MP3 download service that has no Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) tacked on and unlike all the other so called &quot;iTunes killers&quot; it is a pleasure to use.</p>

<p>And <strong><em>surprise surprise</em></strong> you need an American postal address before you can finish the transaction! Yay!</p>
<p>Seriously can music companies really be angry over illegal downloads if they don&#39;t care about their customers overseas? The local Singaporean music association has their painfully embarrassing &quot;Be HIP&quot; campaign which does nothing to create new methods of distribution which clearly people want and would use, then blames us. Pure genius.</p>
