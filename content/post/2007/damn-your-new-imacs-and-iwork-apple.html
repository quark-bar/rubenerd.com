<p>It happens everytime, when I feel as though I&#39;m finally making progress in moving over to open source software and operating systems, Apple timely throws a curve ball and I&#39;m left sitting wide-eyed looking at a new Mac and thinking about Leopard again! This is no good!</p>
<p>Yes so yesterday in the US Apple announced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated Mac minis with Core 2 duo processors (so much for all the rumours predicting they’d be dead soon!)</li>
<li>A new Mac Pro RAID card</li>
<li>Airport Extreme with Gigabit ethernet</li>
<li>Storage and transfer updates to .Mac</li>
<li>iLife 2008</li>
</ul>
<p><img src='//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/contentfooter_iwork20070807.png' alt='contentfooter_iwork20070807.png' style="float:right" /> But of the product updates announced, I was more excited about <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/">iWork</a> and the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">iMac</a>. Finally iWork has a <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/numbers/">spreadsheet programme</a>! You can <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/trial/">download a trial</a> gratis from the Apple website, though it&#39;s pretty slow right now probably from demand. Looking at the press release pictures the graph functions look especially stylish, what you would expect from a suite that has Keynote in it I guess. When I have time I&#39;ll post a review.</p>
<p>And of course the wicked new iMac made of anodized aluminum. I&#39;m disappointed the graphics specs still haven&#39;t been upgraded and that they&#39;re still using <a href="http://news.com/5208-7344_3-0.html?forumID=1&#038;threadID=20105&#038;messageID=173553&#038;start=0">open-source-unfriendly ATI cards</a>, but they&#39;re just so swish:</p>

<p>Wait, that&#39;s a Commodore PET from 1978, what the hell&#39;s that doing there?</p>

<p>So with all my talk about being a <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/freebsd/">FreeBSD</a> <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/kde/">KDE</a> user on boxes I build myself, deep down inside I&#39;m still a Mac fanboy, especially if this post can make it&#39;s way onto <a href="http://www.buzztracker.com/permalink/11763/40099555/Apple---iMac---Design-del.icio.us">Buzztracker</a> page!</p>
