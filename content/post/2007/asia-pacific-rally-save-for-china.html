<p>According to a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&#038;sid=aebgYOEBKdOg&#038;refer=asia">news report from Bloomberg</a> (I love the design of their website), Asian markets with the exception of <strong>China</strong> posted their biggest weekly gains since November last year fueled largely by corporate profit results and forecasts that beat analyst&#39;s expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Japan&#39;s Nikkei 225</strong> rose <code>0.7</code> percent to <code>17,547.11</code>, <strong>South Korea&#39;s Kospi</strong> had its best week since June, the <strong>Australian All Ordinaries</strong> posed a new record number and <strong>Singapore&#39;s Straits Times Index</strong> really impressed by posting its biggest gain in three years.</p>
<p>The <strong>Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia-Pacific Index</strong> added 1.4 percent this week to <code>142.71</code>, extending a two-week, <code>1.4</code> percent rally.</p>
