<p><em>UPDATE: Just so everybody knows, this was an April fools joke :D. I know I know it was a really bad one!</em></p>

The <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">Rubenerd Show</a> is no more. It was fun while it lasted, but these days I simply have too much work and study work to be doing a podcast. It&#39;s very disappointing and I&#39;m a bit upset, but I still think inevitably the decision made itself. I will now be refocusing all my energy on my blog and my university work.</p>
<p>Oh behalf of the whole Rubenerd Show team (aka: me) thank you for your support and listenership over the last two years. I had a great time, and I hope you did too.</p>
<p>All the existing shows will still be available for at least several months, email me if you have any problems.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
