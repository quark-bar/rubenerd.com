<p>Some people like to party in to the early hours of Tuesday morningâ€¦ I run <a href="http://www.grc.com/sr/spinrite.htm">SpinRite</a> on dying hard disk drives <a href="http://ths-k.com/">for friends</a>! Actually I&#39;ve had this Finepix S9600 for a few months now and haven&#39;t had much time to play around with it&#39;s stunning low light capabilities, so here are the results.</p>
<p>Bare in mind it <strong>was</strong> 0300 so my arm wasn&#39;t that steady for taking longer exposures, but you get the idea. Some of them took well over two seconds which makes for some interesting small ghosting effects on the moving images on the screens.</p>
<p>And now I really am off to bed. Sheesh, 0300 on a weekday, what am I thinking?</p>

<p>And finally some photos out my window of Balmoral, Singapore. Seems like there are still plenty of people burning the midnight oil!</p>
