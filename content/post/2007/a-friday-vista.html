<p>Just came back <a href="http://www.gleneagles.com.sg/">from the hospital</a> in Singapore with my mum.</p>
<p>It was good to see Dr Tan again. My mum has been seeing him every few weeks since early 1999, since I was 12 years old. I think it&#39;s safe to say we think he&#39;s a member of the family now. I cannot say enough about Dr Tan, he is the most intelligent, compassionate, friendly and selfless doctor on the planet, and he has a great sense of humour :).</p>
<p>As for the latest news, she went in for blood tests, x-rays and ultrasounds today on her chest to get the latest on what&#39;s going on with the tumours and the fluid in her lungs. He assured us there are are still plenty of treatments available still after all; we were worried given the fact she&#39;s been having treatment since we lived in Australia back in the dark ages.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be going back with her tomorrow for her to start the chemo regime again. Let&#39;s hope it has less side effects than the last one and doesn&#39;t take away all her energy.</p>
<p>Whew, this subject is a bit depressing. Here&#39;s a funny promotional picture for Windows Vista:</p>
