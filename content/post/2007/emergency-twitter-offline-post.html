<p>While Twitter has its latest scheduled downtime, I&#39;ll be posting my random 140 character quips about life and what I&#39;m doing on this site instead. <a href="http://www.walkleys.com/">Walkley award</a> material I can assure you!</p>

<dd>Twitter is back online. And so ends the first installment of the &quot;Emergency Twitter offline postings&quot; ^_^</dd>
<dt>20:51 SGT, 20:51 GMT</dt>
<dd>False alarm. Thought Twitter was back, and I was able to post on Snitter, but Twitter site is still down. <cite>105</cite></dd>
<dt>20:36 SGT, 13:26 GMT</dt>
<dd>Going to try and finish all my studies this week so I have Christmas and a few days after off. Not sure if I can do it! <cite>119</cite></dd>
<dt>20:34 SGT, 13:24 GMT</dt>
<dd>Just came back from dinner. Appears Twitter is still offline. Damn it, been offline nearly all day! <cite>99</cite></dd>
<dt>18:21 SGT, 11:21 GMT</dt>
<dd>Reading up on how to tie MySQL to Ruby in a way similar to how I did it with Perl back in 2005. Wow, long time ago! <cite>115</cite></dd>
<dt>17:23 SGT, 10:23 GMT</dt>
<dd>&quot;Believing the world is 5000 years old and created in 5 days isn’t a moral issue. It’s just stupid!&quot; &#8211; Bill Maher <cite>113</cite></dd>

<dd>My mum just woke up, made her dinner. Her mouth still really hurts, this chemo is nasty stuff <cite>93</cite></dd>
<dt>16:55 SGT, 09:55 GMT</dt>
<dd>I used to set my air con to 24/75F, now I set it to 27/80F and it feels the same! Amazing what a bit of tuning can do! <cite>118</cite></dd>
<dt>16:48 SGT, 09:48 GMT</dt>
<dd>I like to have clean computer workspaces, I hate having lots of windows open. Tweeting on this blog is very inefficient in that respect! <cite>136</cite></dd>
<dt>16:38 SGT, 09:38 GMT</dt>
<dd>And to think I was going to figure out if I could import these posts into Twitter when it came back. Could you imagine?! <cite>120</cite></dd>
<dt>16:30 SGT, 09:30 GMT</dt>
<dd>Excellent quote I just read on Slashdot: &#8220;Correct spelling is the new 1337&#8243;<cite>75</cite></dd>
<dt>16:28 SGT, 09:28 GMT</dt>
<dd>Aircon people have left. I turned the one in my room on and was nearly blown out the window! Makes HUGE difference! <cite>115</cite></dd>
<dt>15:54 SGT, 08:54 GMT</dt>
<dd>This really makes me appreciate how easy it is to use Twitter, and how much time I clearly waste on it! Look at all these! Curse you Felix! <cite>139</cite></dd>
<dt>15:51 SGT, 08:51 GMT</dt>
<dd>And I’m still worried about installing Last.fm on Leopard considering how it manages to screw up X11 so much <cite>108</cite></dd>
<dt>15:49 SGT, 08:49 GMT</dt>
<dd>Trying to clear out a backlog of emails that have accumulated <cite>61</cite></dd>
<dt>15:34 SGT, 08:33 GMT</dt>
<dd>Ah it’s all good. I restarted the VMware Fusion server and all is good again. Whew! <cite>83</cite></dd>
<dt>15:33 SGT, 08:33 GMT</dt>
<dd>What the hell? None of my VMware Fusion virtual machines are detecting my keyboard?! <cite>84</cite></dd>
<dt>15:23 SGT, 08:23 GMT</dt>
<dd>Somehow posting these entries on my blog just doesn’t feel the same, or as spontaneous <cite>86</cite></dd>
<dt>15:18 SGT, 08:18 GMT</dt>
<dd>Aircon servicepeoples just arrived to service our aircons. What a redundant sentence! <cite>85</cite></dd>
<dt>15:16 SGT, 08:16 GMT</dt>
<dd>Started Twitterring on my website while Twitter has scheduled maintenance… in the early afternoon! <cite>100</cite></dd>
