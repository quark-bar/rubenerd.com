<p>One of the best Jon Stewart clips I have ever seen! In this scene Jon attempts to figure out what George W. Bush&#39;s job <em>actually is</em> given his low approval ratings, the fact he&#39;s a bit &quot;intellectually challenged&quot; and the fact that Bush himself seems to be unable to explain it himself!</p>

<p>It involves avocados, crows&#39; nests, power cords, deep analysis and a cache of random clips of Bush saying what his job is. Very funny!</p>

<p>You can watch The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in Australia on <a href="http://www.thecomedychannel.com.au/">The Comedy Channel</a> and intermittently on Thursday and Sundays on <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/">SBS</a>.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t try watching it on SBS in Singapore… because <a href="http://www.sbstransit.com.sg/">SBS is a transport company</a> not a television network.</p>
