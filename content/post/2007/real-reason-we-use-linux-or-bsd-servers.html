<p>Another recently released tool I want to point out is Microsoft Volume Activation 2.0 Tools. Microsoft has added several ways to activate multiple Vista PCs in business desktop environments. The Windows Volume Activation Management Tool (VAMT) lets you use a Multiple Activation Key (MAK) to automate and centrally manage the volume-activation process. MAK activation requires a one-time communication with Microsoft, either independently by each computer, or VAMT can proxy the communication on behalf of multiple computers at once. VAMT is available at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=12044DD8-1B2C-4DA4-A530-80F26F0F9A99&#038;displaylang=en">[huge link]</a>.</p>
