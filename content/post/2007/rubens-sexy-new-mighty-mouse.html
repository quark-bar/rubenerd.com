<p>Having searched for months for a good <em>Bluetooth laser</em> mouse and not finding one from my all time favourite manufacturer Logitech, I finally caved today and got a Wireless Apple Mighty Mouse… and I love it!</p>

<p>For one, the packaging and design of the box was of course what I expected from Apple: clean and minimalist. I&#39;m still dumbfounded that no other company, especially Microsoft, has figured out that out for themselves yet.</p>
<p>As for the mouse itself, I can&#39;t get over how nice it is. The problems I&#39;ve read on the internets&#39; series of tubes about the left/right buttons not being detected properly haven&#39;t happened to me in the last few hours I&#39;ve been using it. Perhaps if I was a hardcore gamer and not a programmer or designer this may happen but so far I&#39;ve had a 100% success rate. Typing that is asking for trouble I&#39;m sure.</p>
<p>When I plugged in the provided Lithium AA batteries (yes, they came with Lithium batteries… most mice you&#39;d be lucky just to get any batteries to start with!) I went ahead with the detection. I just clicked on the Bluetooth icon in my menu bar, chose &quot;Mouse&quot; from the menu and it was detected on the spot. Then I could navigate to the Keyboard/Mouse panel in the System Preferences app and configure the button actions, sensitivity and whatnot.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hesitant to give this a 5 star rating because I&#39;ve only been using it for a few hours, but the fact I&#39;m even contemplating that rating should give you an idea of how impressed I am with this. And no, I didn&#39;t even get paid by Apple to say this!</p>
<p>How easy do you reckon it would be to get this working on my FreeBSD partition? ;).</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be doing a full review of it on my next <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">Rubenerd Show</a> podcast episode, so stay tuned.</p>
