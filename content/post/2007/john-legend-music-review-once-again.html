<p>Sitting in hospital waiting rooms is really quite boring; I wouldn&#39;t encourage anyone to try it any time soon. Anyway in light of this I&#39;ve spend the last half hour or so chilling to <a href="http://www.johnlegend.com/">John Legend&#39;s</a> <em>Once Again</em> album on my iPod.</p>

<p>That&#39;s <a href="http://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm">Security Now</a>, not John Legend! I took the picture, uploaded it and put it here and didn&#39;t even notice! I&#39;m more tired than I thought. Take 2:</p>

<p>I must say right up front before I get into the music itself, the quality of the music is excellent. Even on my iPod with my fairly cheap Philips &quot;Bass Boost&quot; headphones ripped as a  192Kb/s AAC, his voice, the piano in the background and the backup vocals all sound amazing. Whichever recording studio he went to, he got his money&#39;s worth; the whole thing just sounds great. &quot;Great&quot; of course being the <em>technical</em> audiophile term.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why I really love Michael Franks&#39; music and John Legend&#39;s is that they&#39;re both capable of recording songs that really contrast each other (look at me trying to be all professional). What I mean is, it&#39;s much harder to classify their music under a single genre or style; for example John Legend has a few jazzy tunes, some R&amp;B and even a slightly electronic track all on one album. To me it also feels as though the order of the songs is deliberate rather than just a last minute slap dash composition job. It&#39;s one of those CDs you would want to listen to in sequence, the mood and tempo of each track seems to flow from one to the next.</p>
<p>It&#39;s really difficult to pick just one track that I would call a favourite! His chart topping song of course was <em>&quot;P.D.A. / We Just Don&#39;t Care&quot;</em> which I admit I do like, but I would have to say the first track <em>&quot;Coming Home&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;Each Day Gets Better&quot;</em> would be my top two. Again though it&#39;s one of those CDs that have such a diverse mix of styles that sometimes you may prefer some of the songs depending on what mood your in or what time of the day it is.</p>
<p>All around, a pleasure to listen to and a great distraction from these bleak hospital walls. Not to say that I would only listen to John Legend in a hospital; you know what I mean.</p>

<p>When my mixer board and mic arrive from those friggen removalist people&#39;s warehouse thing I&#39;ll review it in more detail.</p>
