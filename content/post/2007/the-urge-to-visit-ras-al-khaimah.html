<p>And now for something <em>completely different</em>: I have the sudden and uncontrollable urge to visit Ras Al-Khaimah (<a href="http://www.rak24.com/">official portal</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_al-Khaimah">Wikipedia page</a>)!</p>

<p>Seriously though, I was sitting in my room doing some <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby programming</a> work over my third coffee of the day (as you do) and my mum was in the other room watching a <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/">Channel News Asia</a> special on the growth of Ras Al-Khaimah in the UAE. To tell the truth I knew of its existence but I really only knew about Dubai and Abu Dhabi in any great detail out of all the Emirates.</p>
<p>Really shows though how fast the world outside the West is growing. They look like they&#39;re doing some amazing stuffâ€¦ to use the formal economic language of course.</p>
<p>Anyone able to lend me some money? Anyone? Don&#39;t all crowd around in a hurry. From what I understand Dubai&#39;s international airport is fairly close, and Ras al-Khaimah has it&#39;s own as well, so I could fly there direct from Singapore on SIA. Wonder if <a href="http://www.rakairways.com/">RAK</a> will go to Singapore?</p>
