<p>Not sure if this is a result of the Leo Laporte bandwidth-sucking-field, but have been having trouble getting through to Jaiku all day today:</p>

<p>If you&#39;d read my post yesterday about <a href="//rubenerd.com/twitter-versus-jaiku-shenanigans/">Twitter versus Jaiku shenanigans</a> I&#39;ve decided now to keep using <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenerd/">Twitter</a> for the time being and use <a href="//rubenerd.com.jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> as more of an aggregation page for all my web 5.0 content or whatever the version number they&#39;re up to nowâ€¦</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be taking down my local <a href="//rubenerd.com/aggregator/">Rubenerd Aggregator</a> page sometime over the next few days as a result, when their servers are all good of course. Maybe I&#39;ll <code>.htaccess</code> a redirect so you go from that to my Jaiku account.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sorry but I have to say it: despite the problems that sometimes rear their problamatic heads I love the friggen internet :D.</p>
