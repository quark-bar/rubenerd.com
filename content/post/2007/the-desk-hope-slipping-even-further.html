<p>You remember back on <a href="//rubenerd.com/the-desk-is-her-hope-slipping/">the 17th of January</a> I posted a <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/thedesk/">Desk</a> entry about how my mum was losing hope? Well today I can honestly say the mood now is even worse.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s just say when I was 17 and my sister 14 my father did some things with a certain person that did not go down so well with my mum to put it lightly. Coupled with her decade long cancer treatment side effects, the pain, the frustration, the constant tiredness and now the suspicion that just maybe he might be at it again is making her more upset.</p>
<p>My mum and I seem to be connected somehow mentally; when she&#39;s depressed or upset it affects me too, and right now I am really, really, really down in the dumps and depressed I knew I was because I listened to an Overnightscape episode and didn&#39;t smile the whole time. I don&#39;t think I was even paying attention.</p>
<p>I really don&#39;t know what I&#39;m trying to accomplish with this post, other than to vent. In which case, thank you for being said vent in which I could vent to. Did that make sense?</p>
<p>And she&#39;s got another major dose of chemotherapy tomorrow. Great.</p>
<p>I also apologise for the show lag time <em>again</em> but my mum comes first.</p>
