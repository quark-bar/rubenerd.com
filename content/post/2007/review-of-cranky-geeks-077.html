<p><a href="http://www.crankygeeks.com/">Cranky Geeks</a> is one of the best video podcasts I watchâ€¦ probably because it&#39;s one of the only video podcasts I watch. No but seriously it&#39;s a fantastic show, I encourage you to check it out especially if you enjoy lighthearted and cranky discussion of tech trends and the well-deserved ridiculing of stupid news stories.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="http://www.crankygeeks.com/2007/08/episode_77_youtube_wants_steph_1.php">This was my review Episode 077</a> dated the 14th of August 2007.</span></p>

<p>Yet again, another great show.</p>
<p>There was definitely a great scale of opinions: on one side you have John and Sebastian predicting doom, Dan telling it like it is, and Natali the optimist who comes from my generation which is always refreshing :).</p>
<p>For the first time in a while I actually found myself agreeing more with what the guests were saying than John or Sebastian. Dan&#39;s point that people like Scoble think they&#39;re really changing the world was a good one, but Natali saying the tech is enabling with many trickle down effects was also well put.</p>
<p>Shows are definitely livelier when the guests are all coming from different places. And when John wears colourful clothes.</p>

<p>But what do I know, I waste all my time on Twitter ;).</p>
