<p>On Sunday my dad and I went to the <a href="http://www.comexshow.com.sg/">COMEX computer trade show</a> at <a href="http://www.suntecsingapore.com/">Suntec City Convention Centre</a>. It was so vast this year it was spread out across floor 3 and the entire floor space of floors 4 and 6. We ended up spending over six hours there and only covered about three quarters of the exibits!</p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="http://www.itshow.com.sg/">IT Show</a> in Singapore which focuses on general consumer technology like high definition televisions as well as computers, COMEX is almost entirely computers and computer-related goods, though there were also many booths for cameras and a few sound system displays.</p>

<p>For me it was an experience in itself because it was the first time I used the camera in my Nokia e61i and used the 3G wireless to instantly upload them to Flickr while I was there. You can view the pictures on my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/sets/72157601815181648/">Flickr COMEX set</a> page.</p>
<p>All in all I ended up getting for peanuts:</p>
<ul>
<li>a 160GB SATA 7200RPM notebook hard disk to upgrade the 100GB drive in my MacBook Pro &#8211; even in a place like Singapore it’s still quite hard to find SATA notebook drives</li>
<li>a flexible cover for my mobile phone</li>
<li>an external DVD+RW dual layered drive and media &#8211; my MacBook Pro’s SuperDrive can read dual layered media but can’t write to them)</li>
<li>some 2700 rechargeable batteries for my camera and MadPlayer</li>
<li>and a set of Apocalpx computer speakers with… wait for it… a valve tube amplifier!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m listening to these speakers now and the quality is just stunning. I played Roxy Music&#39;s Avalon from a CD and the clarity was <strong><em>absolutely breathtaking</em></strong>. I&#39;ll definitely have to put up a dedicated post about them here and review them on the Rubenerd Show.</p>
<p>There&#39;s something about a glowing bulb showing up on your desk at night while you listen to a smooth jazz track that&#39;s just… nice :).</p>
