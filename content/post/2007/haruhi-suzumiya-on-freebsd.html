<p>Today was pretty amazing. Why? I ate a small mango after brushing my teeth and was not bothered by the nauseating spearmint infused citrus flavour.</p>
<p>Actually something big did happen for me today and it&#39;s something that I&#39;ve been wanting to do for ages. I installed from scratch <a href="http://freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> on several PCs and <em>without looking at any of the documentation</em> for the first time. <em>I&#39;m dangerous!</em></p>

<p>In a manner similar to how <a href="http://www.darkmirage.com/">DarkMirror in Singapore</a> talks about <a href="http://www.darkmirage.com/2005/11/14/a-guide-to-learning-japanese/">learning Japanese</a>, my knowledge of FreeBSD didn&#39;t consciously happen, it evolved and eventually clicked. Like most people starting out in the FOSS world after living on Mac OS X and… heaven forbid… <em>Windows</em>, I was somewhat confused by the more intricate details of compiling kernels with optimisation flags and updating port trees with CVS; but after a week of informal study I pulled my old 200MHz Pentium MMX machine out and installed FreeBSD  without looking at any documentation. Without realising it until after I finished, the process of installing and configuring has become second nature.</p>
<p>I really am impressed with the quality of the BSDs and the open source community&#39;s efforts. Xorg + <a href="http://kde.org/">KDE 3.5</a> or <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce 4.2</a> on a FreeBSD 6.1 box with the correct optimisations works flawlessly even on hardware that would struggle with Windows 98! Suddenly all the old machines that litter my expat family&#39;s house have uses. Heck I&#39;m even looking at my old Amiga in a funny way now…</p>
<p>I feel such an overwhelming sense of power now than I did before in a way that proprietary operating systems never really allow. Open source rocks! If I don&#39;t like my X window manager, my desktop environment, my CLI text editor, my shell, my file browsers, my titlebar widgets or even my daemon services that manage SQL or the web, I can just change them or swap them for something else. A company doesn&#39;t dictate what software has to be installed, <em>I do</em>. And if something doesn&#39;t exist or I need to do something mundane, a quick keyboard lashing session later I&#39;ve got Perl doing it for me.</p>

<p>Now I could have continued my exploration of Linux or just continued to hack away at Mac OS X, but I really do appreciate the strict conventions that the BSDs follow and the unwritten mantra that &quot;if something works it&#39;s good&quot; should actually be &quot;if it&#39;s good it will work&quot;. FreeBSD, NetBSD (and from what I can tell from my currently limited experience, OpenBSD) are elegant, fast, very well documented and extremely robust.</p>
<p>It&#39;s got to the stage now where I&#39;m even considering dual booting my MacBook Pro with FreeBSD and Mac OS X just to be able to use this stuff more and more in my day to day life.</p>
<p>For posterity (and because I think they&#39;re cool) I&#39;ve posted some screenshots of some of the boxes I have happily running now. You can see the Mac OS X influence in my thinking with both the KDE and Xfce panels set up to look like the Dock and the permanent menu bar ;).</p>
<p>Here&#39;s Haruhi happily living in KDE 3.5/FreeBSD on my old HP box, (with the cursor unfortunately positioned on her face!!):</p>

<p>And here she is again in Xfce/FreeBSD on my 200MHz (with MMX… wow!) 1997 Sim Lim Square box:</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also configured an old 133MHz Pentium box I picked up for peanuts to run as a dedicated firewall and local intranet webserver to serve up the Schade family wiki, kinda like a digital refrigerator door! Of course I couldn&#39;t put Haruhi on this because I don&#39;t want or need X on this machine. Ah well, can&#39;t win them all!</p>
<p>My next weekend project is to create a Perl script to download portsnap updates so they&#39;re residing on a local hard drive, then configure portsnap on each machine to look up the local server instead of retrieving the same image from the interent four times! Unless anyone knows of a port that already does something similar to this?</p>
