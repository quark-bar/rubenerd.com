<p>Despite my borderline <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/bsd/">manic obsession with BSD</a> on my own systems, I chose <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a> on my mum&#39;s laptop, mostly because she just wanted a really basic system with a computer-illiterate-proof update mechanism, a web browser and that&#39;s it.</p>
<p><img src='//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/downloadubuntu.png' alt='' /></p>
<p>So I was downloading it last night and glanced at the transfer rate. 2.2KiB per second? This was going to take longer than I thought. Until I read it againâ€¦ 2.2MiB per second! In less than 4 minutes I had the latest version of Ubuntu Linux sitting on my desktop, a 697MiB file!</p>
<p>Compared to the internet I&#39;ve used in Malaysia (argh TMnet!) and Australia (TPG is fairly reliable but slow), Singapore has it going on :).</p>
