<p><span style="font-style:italic">You can <a href="http://www.techworld.com/whitepapers/WindowsVsLinux.cfm">download the whitepaper of which I speak here</a>.</span></p>
<p>Ironically I was at Linux.org today for some reason and saw something that I never thought I would find interesting: a Google AdWords advertisement! Clicking on it brought me to a whitepaper on TechWorld comparing Linux and Windows.</p>
<blockquote><p>In this report, we aim to look at both Linux and the Windows family from a neutral standpoint. Our hope is that a balanced viewpoint will help you make a decision based on the facts, rather than on ill-thought-out opinion. TechWorld is a technology-independent publication and the report’s author runs both Windows and Linux on his various servers, laptops and desktops with no particular preference.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a very fun read, especially in light of the <a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/10/2148253">latest developments in the SCO case</a> which discredits large areas of it. Apparently according to this the SCO intellectual property case was a genuine threat to Linux and one which needed be taken seriously, even though virtually nobody else thought so. Do you think they were paid off somehow… hmm… ;).</p>
