<p>Well after one of the most trying, testing [and other words beginning with T] weeks we&#39;ve ever had, things seem to be going a bit better now. My mum is having a huge amount of trouble keeping food down still and all her joints are really painful meaning she&#39;s spending her whole time stuck in bed, but her sense of humour seems to be coming back which makes it all seem a bit less dire.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been given leave for a week by my boss which is great news and I appreciate it, and my mum has her right medication now. I&#39;m still going to be taking it easy for this week and try to make the most of the situation.</p>
<p>Given though the current and at times unpredictable way my life is going at the moment, I think I&#39;ll be moving the Rubenerd Show to once a week again. I&#39;ve loved doing week daily shows but I think it&#39;s time to be reasonable; there have been too many delays as it is.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone again, hopefully I&#39;ll be able to answer the mountains of email in a week or so.</p>
