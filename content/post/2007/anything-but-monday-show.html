<p><img id="image674" src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/abmshow_free_144.jpg" alt="ABM" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px" />So I was catching up on some missed Overnightscape episodes when I heard Frank talking about his upcoming <a href="http://www.abmshow.com/">Anything but Monday Show</a> with Mad Mike. Visiting the <a href="http://www.theovernightscape.com/">Overnightscape</a> site, I saw the link to ABM so I thought I&#39;d give it a look-see.</p>
<p>In all honesty, I heard some of the Overnightscape shows with Mad Mike last year and really did not like them that much; I guess my sense of humour is somewhat different. Perhaps being an Aussie I just tend to appreciate British comedy more. But I digress. I listened to the &quot;free sample&quot; they have available and think it&#39;s a bit better. I&#39;ve signed up to the ABM website forum.</p>
<p>Currently though there&#39;s a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity">purchasing power parity</a> problem. I&#39;m living in Malaysia and the asking price of RM27.90 per month (US$7.99) is very steep, though I&#39;m sure when I move back to Singapore and can pay SG$12.26 a month it will be a bit easier. I want to listen to some more episodes first though.</p>
<p>All that said though, I really like their website: Frank and Matt have outdone themselves again. The scary thing though is it bears a striking resemblence to the new Rubenerd Show site and blogging engine I&#39;m designing myself in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> to replace WordPress for a university projectâ€¦ just replace the orange and red with blue and green with a downtown shot of the Singapore CBD at night. 209 anyone?</p>
