<p>In no particular order, to test lists in Fargo:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Bette Davis Eyes</em>, Kim Carnes</li>
<li><em>True</em>, Spandau Ballet</li>
<li><em>Lily Was Here</em>, David A. Stewart</li>
<li><em>Avalon</em>, Roxy Music</li>
<li><em>Jealous Guy</em>, Bryan Ferry (I know, I know; I like his cover)</li>
<li><em>Baker Street</em>, Gerry Rafferty</li>
</ul>
<p>The irony hasnâ€™t been lost on me that these songs were recorded either before I was born, or when I was an infant.</p>
