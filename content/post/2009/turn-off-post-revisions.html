<p>This is probably old news in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> world since <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_2.6">2.6</a> and subsequent versions have been released, but given I&#39;ve decided to stick around using it for a bit longer I thought it was worth getting right when I installed it fresh here <a href="//rubenerd.com/we-are-back/">since the [forced] move</a>.</p>
<p>One feature I really don&#39;t use is Post Revisions. While I can see the benefit of using it on a Wiki, on a blog written by just one guy it doesn&#39;t really make much sense; plus it adds junk records to the database which makes backing up said blog a more time consuming process than it needs to be.</p>
<p><a href="http://lesterchan.net/wordpress/2008/07/17/how-to-turn-off-post-revision-in-wordpress-26/">Courtesy of Lester Chan</a>, if you want to turn Post Revisions off, just add the following line to your <code>wp-config.php</code> file.</p>
<pre>define('WP_POST_REVISIONS', false);</pre>
<p>He also has instructions on how to delete existing entries made my Post Revisions if you&#39;ve had it turned on for a while.</p>
