<p>What&#39;s worse than waiting for a parcel to arrive in the mail? Not being able to hastily take a sharp picture with your non-3GS iTelephone because there&#39;s insufficient light and it doesn&#39;t have proper focusing! Wait, let me try that again.</p>
<p>What&#39;s worse than waiting for a parcel to arrive in the mail? Having it arrive when you&#39;re not home! Somewhere out there in the warehouse districts of Singapore is a <strong><em>custom Unicomp SpaceSaver</em></strong>…</p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve had too much [coffee] to drink.</p>
<p>Did I mention I came very close today to getting a <a style="font-weight:bold" href="//rubenerd.com.com/unicomp-order/">custom Unicomp SpaceSaver bucking spring IBM Model M replica keyboard</a>?</p>
