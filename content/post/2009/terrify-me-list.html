<p>I&#39;ve been doing far too many of these <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/livingsocial/">LivingSocial</a> lists, I fear I may be fuelling an addiction for which I will soon develop such a dependency that I&#39;ll start dreaming about lists to create. Oh, too late, I have been.</p>
<p>This list piqued my interest given it deals with negatives rather than positives: <em>Five things that terrify me!</em> I&#39;d say they&#39;re mostly in order this time:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Windows Vista</strong></li>
<li><strong>An Empty Coffee Cup</strong> (almost went with <strong>Cold Coffee</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>Lighting Stoves</strong> (manually lighting gas flames… argh!)</li>
<li><strong>Religion</strong> (they didn’t have <strong>Abrahamic</strong> specifically, bummer)</li>
<li>Did you get me my <strong>Cheese Whiz</strong> Boy?</li>
</ol>
