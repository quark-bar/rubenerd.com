<p>As I’ve eluded to previously, the <strong><em>primary reason</em></strong> why I use <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Mozilla Firefox</a> is for it’s security and privacy extensions as I’ve <a href="//rubenerd.com/p3849/">discussed previously here</a>; in particular <a href="http://noscript.net/">NoScript</a>. My cousin Nim can’t stand it when I say killer, so I’m going to say Firefox and NoScript are a killer combination. I really mean it!</p>
<p>Two random points from my family’s use of NoScript I thought I’d quickly share here:</p>
<ol>
<li>It dawned on me though that when I upgraded my sister’s MacBook to the latest version of Firefox that it should have been doing it for her automatically along with her plugins. She’s a NoScript user too but both her Firefox and her NoScript installations were woefully out of date. Checking the Update tab under Advanced in her preferences pane, I noticed her automatic updates were turned off. I don’t quite know why, she claims she never unchecked the boxes, but be that as it may it meant she was running older and potentially less secure versions of software for a while now.
</p>
</li>
<li>NoScript is updated on a very regular basis! Because I just put my MacBook to sleep instead of turning it off I can go for days without closing Firefox, and when I reopen it, it almost always has updates available for NoScript.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

Again NoScript and Firefox are a match made in heaven, but they need constant updating to work optimally and securely.</p>
