<p>Dell&#39;s profits are way down, and Microsoft makes a move that could scare beige box makers even more.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>CNET is reporting in an article surprisingly titled <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31021_3-10401796-260.html?tag=newsLeadStoriesArea.1">Dell earnings down 54 percent</a> that Dell&#39;s earnings are down 54%. <a href="http://news.cnet.com/Dell-Apple-should-close-shop/2100-1001_3-203937.html">What would I do?</a> I&#39;d shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders ^_^.</p>
<p>This comes on the heels of Microsoft&#39;s <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/hardware/soa/Microsoft-dabbles-in-hardware/0,130061702,339299610,00.htm">downright bizarre move</a> to brand an Acer notebook computer as their own, presumably in an attempt to deliver the same vertical experience <a href="http://apple.com/mac/">Apple does</a>. Much as they abandoned their PlaysForSure partners (with an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/playsforsure/">outdated web page to boot</a>) and went with their own integrated Zune system, could this be a sign Microsoft are willing to start their own hardware business to compete with their own partners in the personal computer space?</p>
<p>The recession, these moves by Microsoft, the razor thin profit margins on netbooks, it&#39;s certainly not a good time to be a beige box PC manufacturer. Especially when your products are being sold in stores where creepy, cringeworthy things <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/11/17/microsoft-store-employees-break-out-in-dance-video/">like this happen</a>. Run away!</p>
<p>I agree with <a href="http://gdayworld.thepodcastnetwork.com/">No Illusions and G&#39;day World</a> host Cameron Reilly&#39;s <a href="http://twitter.com/cameronreilly/status/5841050460">comment on Twitter</a>, it&#39;s almost as if Microsoft&#39;s strategy is to be as lame and embarrassing as possible. Another example of programmers and engineers like <a href="http://twitter.com/nickhodge">Nick Hodge</a> being stifled by management and a marketing department that are so breathtakingly out of touch with the outside world it beggars belief.</p>
