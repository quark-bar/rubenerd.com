<p>It seems this attitude is spreading. Having spent some time at my <a href="http://rubenerd.com/unisa-virus-fail/">uni&#39;s computer barns</a> recently, I&#39;ve overheard conversations even by non-techie people about how Facebook is starting to worry them. Some naturally talk about how their significant others, bosses and the like accidentally saw something they weren&#39;t supposed to, but others talked about the issues Owyang is hearing too. This is a fundamental shift in attitudes.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Facebook users probably don&#39;t know or care, but all it takes is for enough people to become worried for a shift to start happening. The Facebook guys should be taking this gradual erosion of their reputation <strong>very</strong> seriously because unlike their <a href="http://rubenerd.com/facebook-changes-again/">constant remodelling</a> that angers people but then gets ignored, this could be enough to scare people away from their service.</p>
<p>The problem is, with MySpace and Friendster back in the day there was a viable alternative in the form of Facebook to move over to when things starting getting icky. What is there for disaffected Facebook users? Twitter is a different type of service, and Orkut doesn&#39;t seem to be getting anywhere outside South America.</p>
<p>I suppose we&#39;ve got a while yet before things really change.</p>
