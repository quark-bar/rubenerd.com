<p>This has happened to me so many times I thought I&#39;d post a clarification here to help myself remember, while passing it off as a legitimate blog post topic. Clever yes? Don&#39;t answer that.</p>
<p>Having moved to Unix-like systems from Windows when I finished high school I&#39;m used to firing up my shell and entering <code><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifconfig">ifconfig</a></code> with either the <code>-a</code> option or by specifying a specific network interface such as <code>eth0</code> to find out DHCP assigned IP addresses, subnet masks, grilled cheese sandwiches and the like.</p>

<p>As shown below, on Windows the command is deceptively similar in all but one letter: <code><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipconfig">ipconfig</a></code>. As with the classic DOS goodness Windows replaced the commands also accept flags with forward-slashes instead of short dashes.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> According to the completely infallible Wikipedia, ifconfig sloppily stands for <em>&quot;<strong>i</strong>nter<strong>f</strong>ace <strong>conf</strong>igurator&quot;</em>, whereas ipconfig stands for <em>&quot;<strong>i</strong>nternet <strong>p</strong>rotocol <strong>conf</strong>iguration&quot;</em>. Donâ€™t you just love unambiguous commands?</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s interesting how our minds change isn&#39;t it? I started using our DOS desktop back before I even started primary school and I got so used to the commands they became second nature. Since moving to the wonderful world of FreeBSD and cross pollinating my knowledge on similar GNU/Linux, NetBSD, Mac OS X and OpenSolaris machines, my DOS knowledge hasn&#39;t been forgotten, but it&#39;s become something I have to &quot;think&quot; to use. If I had a cent for every time I attempted to type and use <code>ls</code> and <code>top</code> on Windows machines now, I&#39;d have at least enough cash for a grilled cheese sandwich with at least avocado and onions.</p>

<p>Two grilled cheese sandwich references in one post, three including this sentence. I&#39;m on a roll. Wait I&#39;m not discussing eating a <em>&quot;roll&quot;</em>, it&#39;s a <em>&quot;grilled cheese sandwich&quot;</em>. Wait, that&#39;s four times. Grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
