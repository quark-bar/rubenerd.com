<p>Today&#39;s favourite photo I found on the internets is the one included above for your convenience. Really, there&#39;d be no point talking about a photo I&#39;d found without showing you what it was, otherwise for all you know I could have been making it up. It&#39;s an integrity thing.</p>

<p>Said photo is <a href="http://www.airliners.net/photo/Untitled-%28Dresser-Industries%29/Boeing-707-123%28B%29/0695798/L/">by Paul Kippling on Airliners.net</a> of a 707 business jet cabin in Rotterdam from 1983. Why is this aeroplane awesome? The fake wood veneer on the bulkheads and walls; the angular brown leather office chairs; the tartan upholstered couch; the ancient rounded television screen mounted in the wall; it couldn&#39;t be more retro if it tried!</p>
<p>In case you haven&#39;t figured it out, I revel in such retroness. Speaking of which, got a <a href="//rubenerd.com/dosbox-to-rescue/">comment from the DOSBox folks</a>.</p>

<p><strong>N5038 (cn 17652/77)</strong> In need for space? Try this! This particular 707 was parked in 1983 at Davis Montham AFB where it was used for C135 spares. Wonder what happened to the sofasâ€¦</p>
