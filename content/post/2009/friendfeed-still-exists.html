<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="http://rubenerd.com/facebooks-reputation-erosion/">my comment</a> on someone&#39;s tweet about Facebook (wow, wasn&#39;t that an internet sentence) one of my friend CalgaryGuru&#39;s <a href="http://twitter.com/CalgaryGuru/status/5916201929">tweets</a> got me thinking about <a href="http://friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a>.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/CalgaryGuru/status/5916201929"><p>Just pulled Facebook out of my FriendFeed… Stuff I post on FB doesn’t always make sense as a twitter tweet. <strong>Besides, FF is depricated</strong>.</p>
<p><em>(emphasis added)</em></p></blockquote>

<p>It seems like only yesterday all the social network big wigs, head honchos and other cranially related titles (cranially related titles?) were using FriendFeed and hailing it as the aggregation answer to all their disparate service problems. Then overnight <a href="http://rubenerd.com/facebook-friendfeed/">Facebook bought them out</a>, and now they&#39;re about as relevant as <a href="http://knol.google.com/">Google Knol</a> or the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/">Rubénerd Blog</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;d anticipated the sale to Facebook would scare some people off, but I had no idea it would be this quick and to the sheer extent it did. As far as I know Leo Laporte&#39;s <a href="http://twit.tv/">TWiT</a> network uses it for shows, but other than that when I go to FriendFeed it feels like a ghost town. I&#39;m <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=friendfeed+ghost+town">not the only one</a> saying this.</p>
<p><a href="http://friendfeed.com/rainorshine/">My dad</a> <a href="http://friendfeed.com/rubenerd/">and I</a> still have our FriendFeed accounts, but neither of us can remember when we used them. Do you still use yours?</p>
<p>The funny thing is, I still get emails every now and then telling me someone new is following my FriendFeed profile. Huh.</p>
