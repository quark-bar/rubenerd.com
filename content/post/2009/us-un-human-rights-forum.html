<p>I would say <em>&quot;yahoo!&quot;</em>, but that&#39;s a trademark right? Anyway, it&#39;s official folks, the United States has rejoined the United Nations Human Rights Forum. Cynics may decry it as a token gesture by a government to rejoin a fundamentally flawed organisation, but as I always say, I&#39;m cautiously optimistic.</p>

<p>United Nations, New York &#8211; The United States won a seat on the United Nations’ top human rights organization Tuesday, closing out another vestige of the Bush administration’s confrontational relationship with the world body.</p>
<p>The US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, hailed the return to the human rights forum as part of America’s determination &quot;to again play a meaningful leadership role in multilateral organizations.&quot; The US will not wait for a 2011 review of the council to try to reform it, she added, but &#8220;will be working very hard from an early stage to try to support the strengthening and improvement of this body.&quot;</p>

<p>Congratulations to my American friends, this a bold step in the right direction! I can already see the world&#39;s perception of the US starting to change for the better again.</p>
