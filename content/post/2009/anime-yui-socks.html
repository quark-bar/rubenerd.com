<p>Hard hitting reporting I can assure you ^_^.</p>
<p>Hey, I wasn&#39;t able to go to the Anime Festival Asia 2009 convention in Singapore that I <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/afa09-announced/">so gleefully reported on</a> and see the K-On! seiyuus because I was still taking exams, cut me some slack! Or perhaps in this case some <em><a href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/anime.kon.02.4.jpg">stockings</a></em>. Wait, that didn&#39;t sound right. Never mind.</p>
