<p>Unfortunately I&#39;ve come across something that doesn&#39;t seem to be playing well with Mozilla Firefox 3.5: <a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://tmp.garyr.net/">Tab Mix Plus</a>. Despite working flawlessly in the betas and release candidates, my tabs since going to the final release have been displaying weird artefacts or are simply not drawn properly.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll wait to see if I can reproduce it predictably, then file a bug report or post a message on their forums. I&#39;m running version 0.7.2009062901 which as far as I know is the most current one.</p>
