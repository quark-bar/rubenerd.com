<p>I saw this post from the White House blog and Jim’s comments on it, and I had to add my own family experiences around this time of year. If you’re not on Google Reader here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>My family could best be described as agnostic I guess, but we still had hearty dinners over Easter and Christmas. Since moving to Singapore though when I was a kid we were disconnected from our extended families so it was just mum, dad Elke and I. We also started celebrating Chinese New Year which is much bigger in Singapore than Easter or Christmas which is mostly celebrated just for the tourists and business folks!</p>
<p>I have fond memories of those gatherings; for a few hours we pretended my mum wasn’t terminally ill and we didn’t have a care in the world. Except when it came time to clean up of course!!!</p>
