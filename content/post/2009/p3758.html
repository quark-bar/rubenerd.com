<p>In the <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/p3756p3756/">previous post here</a> I talked about how a Universal Music executive <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10158141-93.html">was discussing ways to keep growing labels</a>… I&#39;m sorry, I mean the <em>&quot;music industry&quot;</em>! I since went back and checked out some of the comments, and I reckon ordaj was spot on:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why must there always be growth? Why can’t businesses operate sustainable businesses?</p></blockquote>
<p>Sustainable business? There are ones that exist, but unfortunately I see that phrase more commonly in lists of humourous oxymorons than in business proposals, especially when we&#39;re discussing music labels! Brings to mind others such as the automotive industry too.</p>
<p>This is the problem with current economics and business studies, far too much emphasis is placed on growth as the important factor in determining how a country or business is progressing. I&#39;m not naive enough to say it&#39;s not important at all, but it&#39;s certainly only one of the many important factors to consider. Such as, I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis.</p>
