<p>In a previous post I <a href="http://rubenerd.com/java-linked-list-stack/">implemented a basic stack</a> in Java using <a href="http://rubenerd.com/linked-list-theory/">linked lists</a>. In this post I&#39;ll be looking at implementing a rudimentary queue.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>Unlike a stack where the first object to be added is the last to be taken off which results in an inversion of order, objects in a queue are taken off in the same order they were added. In the context of a linked list, this means the objects are added to the head like a stack, but they&#39;re removed from the end instead.</p>
<p>In this case much of the code from the stack linked list is the same, all we need to change are the stack specific terms from <strong>pop</strong> and <strong>push</strong> to terms <strong>put</strong> and <strong>get</strong>, and change the remove method to pull objects from the end of the linked list not the beginning.</p>
<pre>
public class Queue {
  Node head;

  public Queue(Object payload) {
    if (payload)
      head = new Node(payload);
  }

  private class Node {
    Object payload;
    Node next;

    public Node(Object payload) {
      this.payload = payload;
    }
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Aside from being renamed from <strong>push</strong>, the <strong>put</strong> method is unchanged from the Stack method other than the name.</p>
<pre>
public void put(Object payload) {
  Node newNode = new Node(payload);
  if (head == null)
    head = newNode;
  else {
    newNode.next = head;
    head = newNode;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>The <strong>pop</strong> method is changed to <strong>get</strong> the last link list element not the first. We find this by traversing the linked list until we find a <strong>Node</strong> that has <code>null</code> as its next <strong>Node</strong>.</p>
<pre>
public Object get() {
  Node current = head;
  Node previous = head;
  while (current.next != null) {
    previous = current;
    current = current.next;
  }
  Object toReturn =  current.payload;
  previous.next = null;
  return toReturn;
}
</pre>
