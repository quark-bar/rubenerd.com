<p>If you’re having trouble accessing my podcast at the root domain of this site <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">RubenerdShow.com</a>, you’re not alone, I haven’t been able to access it all afternoon.</p>
<p>As soon as I figure out what the problem is I’ll report it and hopefully fix it. Sorry about this. ;_;</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I found the cause of the problem, a poorly formed index.php file. I don’t know for the life of me why the it was modified, I probably did it in a sleep walk or something!</p>
