<p>Murphy&#39;s law has been striking me with a vengence today, with three unrelated online events that will be taking place while I&#39;m in the sky between Adelaide and Singapore or shuffling through airport Xray machines.</p>
<p>Firstly, one of my favourite <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Whole Wheat Radio</a> artists <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Artists:Steve_Durr">Steve Durr</a> is <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Steve_Durr_2009_House_Concert">performing live at 20:00 Alaskan time</a>. Last time I heard Steve live at Whole Wheat I managed to buy a CD to share with my dad and we even got a signed poster! When I found out about the time I promptly kicked the table and stubbed my big toe. As my mum used to say about herself and eye shadow, I never looked good in purple.</p>
<p>The second is of course the epic Facebook landgrab where you&#39;ll be able to register for a username to finally rid ourselves of those narly user ID numbers. The username registration will be going live at 13:00 US Pacific time. Granted I have a fairly unusual name combination, in fact searches online have only ever returned one other Ruben Schade who happened to be a part of the Roswell investigation of all things. Still, it&#39;d be nice to be sure.</p>
<p>The third is <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/grilled-cheese-sandwiches/">grilled cheese sandwiches</a>.</p>
