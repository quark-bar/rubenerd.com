<p>So The Googles have just come out and said they&#39;re releasing an operating system dubbed <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html">Google Chrome OS</a>. Cool. This part is my favourite:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/introducing-google-chrome-os.html"><p>The software architecture is simple — Google Chrome running <strong>within a new windowing system</strong> on top of a Linux kernel.</p></blockquote>
<p>I use FreeBSD as well as Mac OS X on the desktop and while it does have some nice features, X11 is kinda kludgey. I&#39;ll be really interested to see what Google does as a graphical front-end instead.</p>
<p>The other question on my mind is: will Google Chrome OS run Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird? :)</p>
