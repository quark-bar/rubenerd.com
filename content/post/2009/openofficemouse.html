<p>I&#39;m generally pretty quick to pick out internet jokes from the real thing, but this latest announcement for an <a href="http://www.openofficemouse.com/">OpenOfficeMouse</a> honestly had me bamboozled: were their product, website and press release for real?</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.openofficemouse.com/"><p>Orvieto, Italy, November 6, 2009: In partnership with the OpenOffice.org community, WarMouse announced the release of the OpenOfficeMouse, the first multi-button application mouse designed for the worldâ€™s leading open-source office productivity suite. With a revolutionary and patented design featuring 18 buttons, an analog joystick, and support for as many as 52 key commands, the OpenOfficeMouse is intended to provide a faster and more efficient user interface for OpenOffice.org applications such as Writer and Calc than the conventional icons, pull-down menus, and hotkeys presently permit.</p></blockquote>
<p>I tend to stay clear of sites like Engadget but they&#39;ve picked up (to pardon a terrible mouse related pun) the story and are <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/11/06/openofficemouse-isnt-free-isnt-pretty/">running with it</a>, so I&#39;m leaning slightly more towards thinking its true. Lots of poorly used analogies in this paragraph, I really should learn not to blog this late at night.</p>
<p>While initially finding myself asphyxiated by the terrible, awful, cheesy, plasticy design and requiring several stiff cups of coffee to recover, I have to say having thought about it for a day or so the idea of having a mouse with buttons like this does appeal to me. As long as the primary and secondary buttons were easy enough to differentiate from all the function buttons and I could cope with the 1990s-eque design.</p>
<p>Granted these are mostly keyboard based applications, but Imagine being able to perform a spell check, insert a table of a specific size, add headings and whatnot all while moving a mouse around in OpenOffice.org for example, or imagine all the things you could do with TextMate or Emacs.</p>
<p>It&#39;d be like learning how to touch type on a keyboard: the learning curve would be steep and it&#39;d take dedication and the forgoing of instant gratification when you buy it, but once you&#39;re familiar with the location of the buttons and you know instinctively what you&#39;ve assigned each one to do, I imagine you could do some pretty amazing things.</p>
<h3>A chorded mouse, perhaps?</h3>

<p>Interestingly enough, people have been using the word <strong>corded</strong> to describe it, presumably because its not wireless which we&#39;ve come to expect from mouses as of late. With all those extra buttons though, it does remind me somewhat of those chorded<em>[sic]</em> keyboards such as the <a href="http://www.frogpad.com/">FrogPad</a>. To me this makes this product even more intriguing, imagine if you could somehow combine buttons together to perform specific tasks and provide parameters, such as specifying the size of a new table instead of just creating one.</p>
<p>I must admit after Apple pulled the rug out from under me with their latest Magic Mouse which doesn&#39;t have a third mouse button. My MacBook Pro is dual booted with FreeBSD and I don&#39;t want to have to swap mouses each time I reboot! With that in mind I must say this OpenOfficeMouse looks intriguing! Wait, bad choice of words, if I got one I wouldn&#39;t want to <strong>look</strong> at it. Never mind, my hand will cover it up!</p>
<p>For now my aging Mighty Mouse will do, but it&#39;s something to keep in mind.</p>
