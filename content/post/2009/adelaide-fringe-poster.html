<p>The Adelaide Fringe poster design contest has been over for a while now, but I came up with inspiration for this billboard design as I was walking home this evening. The best part of this design is I don&#39;t need to provide an SVG source because its so easy to recreate! Whaddya think? Huh? Huh? Isn&#39;t it soâ€¦ phisticated?</p>
<p>To give you an idea what it would like displayed in the real world, I did this incredibly realistic photoshop job of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nikski/61008869/">this Adelaide billboard photo by nikski</a> on Flickr.</p>

<p>In other news, I&#39;m assuming this Adelaide Fringe whatnot is some sort of hairdressing and barber event?</p>
