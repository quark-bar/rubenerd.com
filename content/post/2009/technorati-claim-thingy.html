<p><a href="http://technorati.com/claim/ey5s9axf8h">Reclaiming my blog</a> at <a href="http://technorati.com/people/technorati/rubenerd">Technorati</a> with the new address. I like the way you don&#39;t have to include this link in your header information anymore, good move.</p>
<p>The last time I claimed a blog with Technorati was <a href="//rubenerd.com/technorati/">back in 2005</a> when I was 19. If you view my Technorati profile you can still see my profile picture that I haven&#39;t changed since then. Face is the same but my hair is certainly much longer!</p>
