<p>It&#39;s interesting how I&#39;m often asked things in the street and in coffee shops here in Singapore about things that only a person who lives here would know. Tourists say they can tell I live here because I&#39;m caucasian but not drenched in sweat when I walk around!</p>
<p>I was in a coffee shop this morning (no, really?) when a guy at the table next to mine noticed my SingTel EVDO USB modem poking out from my MacBook Pro. Why did that sound wrong? Anyway he wanted to know if I had the same problem as he did on his Mac when using the modem whereby it will sometimes claim no devices can be found or that a carrier can&#39;t be detected.</p>
<p>Given I was able to bring up a screenshot of the error message he described, it&#39;s clear I&#39;ve had the same problem from time to time. The extremely high tech solution I&#39;ve found is to… wait for it… unplug the modem, wait a few seconds then plug it back in again. I&#39;ve also noticed it helps to wait for a good minute or so before attempting to make a connection after you&#39;ve plugged the modem in.</p>
<p>And some people claim this blog isn&#39;t useful, can you believe it? Grilled cheese sandwiches.</p>
