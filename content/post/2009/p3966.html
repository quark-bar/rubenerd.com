<p>And now for something to do with computer software. If you want the best hot cross buns in Australia, <a href="http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,,25272441-2682,00.html">you need to be in Adelaide</a> people!</p>
<blockquote><p>AUSTRALIA loves Nick and Margaret Davey’s buns. The proprietors of Glenelg’s Orange Spot Bakery have snatched the coveted national title of Best Hot Cross Buns in Australia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the article, they almost didn’t make it to the competition in Melbourne because they upstaged the grub on their plane… take that airline food!</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;They were still hot, and the smell just filled the cabin.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone wanted them &#8211; stuff the airline food, they said.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what was their secret?</p>
<blockquote><p>Nick said the secret was to use local produce.</p>
<p>&quot;We use good quality flour and Australian fruit. I’m convinced it’s the way to go.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People sometimes call me a local fruit. I tell them I’m not really local, I was born in Sydney but lived in Singapore most of my life. Flaw in their logic you see.</p>
