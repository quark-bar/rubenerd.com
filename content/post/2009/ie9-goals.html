<blockquote cite="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2009/11/18/an-early-look-at-ie9-for-developers.aspx"><p>Our focus is providing rich capabilities – the ones that most developers want to use – in an interoperable way. Developers want more capabilities in the browser to build great apps and experiences; they want them to work in an interoperable way so they don’t have to re-write and re-test their sites again and again. The standards process offers a good means to that end.</p></blockquote>
<p>Two quick thoughts on the subject:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ll believe it when I see it.</li>
<li>Just ditch Trident and adopt WebKit already. All the work has been done for you, no point reinventing the wheel.</li>
</ul>
