<p>I&#39;m typing this post as we speak on my <a href="//rubenerd.com/thinkpad-x40/">second hand IBM ThinkPad X40</a> and I have to say I&#39;m thrilled with it! While obviously larger in dimensions than a netbook, I just can&#39;t get over how light it is. I put it in my bag I usually haul my 15 inch MacBook Pro in along with my folder of study papers and as I carried it to the Boatdeck for my morning cup of coffee the bag felt like there was only the folder in it!</p>
<p>The machine currently has Windows XP Professional installed and even has the genuine OEM licence sticker on it. Given I&#39;m not sure how much Windows software I&#39;ll need to run for my studies in the future I&#39;ve decided to shrink the Windows partition and put FreeBSD on it with a boot menu.</p>
<p>The main thing I was worried about was the tiny 1.8&quot; ZIF PATA hard drive, I had read plenty of stories by people claiming the 4800RPM drive is noisy and has slow seek times but it booted XP pretty quickly and loading applications didn&#39;t seem to take too long at all. Given this is a second hand machine I will be running SpinRite on the drive before I put any data onto it to triple check that it&#39;s functioning properly.</p>
<p>Even if the internal drive turns out to be working flawlessly, once I&#39;ve got a bit more money I will be looking into a replacement if only to protect myself against errors that I can&#39;t see right now. 1.8&quot; ZIF PATA drives are uncommon but not too difficult to find, 60GB Samsung drives seem to be going for around $80. Another option is Amazon.com stocks 1.8&quot; ZIF PATA 16GB SLC drives for US$140 which is way too steep for my budget but could be something I get in the distant future if I still have this machine.</p>
<p>As for the other features, I&#39;ve been using it lightly for half an hour and the bundled battery still reports a 90% charge which is pleasantly surprising! I was also able to connect to our WPA2 secured AirPort WiFi network at home without any problems, the next thing to test will be whether it can use my university&#39;s VPN.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t intend to spend much money on this machine but I did pick up a few replacement mouse stick caps for a couple of bucks, and a 12.1&quot; screen protector for another few bucks at the Mawson Lakes Apple shop of all places.</p>
<p>I got me a ThinkPad netbook! Boo yah!</p>
