<cite>Vim (left) compared to MacVim (right)</cite></p>
<p>I try my best to include as much information from personal experience as I can when I do my reviews of software here, but sometimes I forget something critical which later involves me hitting my head on a table or similarly raised flat surface.</p>
<p>In August of last year I wrote up a <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p1550/">review of the MacVim text editor</a> which, as you’ve probably already figured out, is a native Cocoa port of the venerable <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim text editor</a>. Back then I admitted I didn’t see the point of using MacVim when Vim was already available in Mac OS X and could easily be accessed from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal.app">Terminal <span style="font-size:x-small;">[Wikipedia]</span></a>, but I stated I’d started using MacVim anyway.</p>
<p>I thought I’d clear up some ambiguity now that several months have passed: MacVim is the ultimate Mac text editor and I use it exclusively now for everything! It has become such a critical part of my life now that I can’t possibly imagine going back to <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit">TextEdit <span style="font-size:x-small;">[Wikipedia]</span></a>. It’s an excellent application that works just as regular Vim does, but with all the benefits of being a native Cocoa application such as native file open and save windows, a broader range of colours for syntax highlighting… plus gosh darn it, it just looks nice!</p>
<p>Since my initial review I’ve also learned more regarding execution from the Terminal. I’ve broken the post up into three sections, to pretend I’m organised.</p>
<h3>1. The mvim script</h3>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/icon.terminal.64.png" alt="Terminal.app icon" style="height:64px; width:64px; display:inline; border:0px; margin:0 0 10px 20px; float:right" />Paulo posted a question on my original review and answered it before I even could! If you’re reading this Paulo, do you have a website you want me to link to?</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks for sharing this! One question thou: I’ve used ports install MacVim and I can’t find the mvim script that is supposed to be shipped with it. Am I missing something?</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Figured that you need to get the version from the project’s web site at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">http://code.google.com/p/macvim/</a></p>

<h3>2. Using an ampersand to stay in the shell</h3>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/icon.terminal.64.png" alt="Terminal.app icon" style="height:64px; width:64px; display:inline; border:0px; margin:0 0 10px 20px; float:right" />This is something I already knew given I use FreeBSD so heavily now, but I realised others might not. If you want to execute MacVim in a directory from the Terminal but you still want to work in that directory, you can append an ampersand to the command:</p>
<pre>% mvim [filename] &#038;</pre>
<p>This is really useful if you want to edit source code in MacVim and compile it in the Terminal.</p>
<h3>3. Command aliases for the absent minded</h3>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/icon.terminal.64.png" alt="Terminal.app icon" style="height:64px; width:64px; display:inline; border:0px; margin:0 0 10px 20px; float:right" />Another tip from Unix is adding aliases to your profile shell script so if you’re like me and you absent mindedly type <code>vim</code> or <code>vi</code> when you meant <code>mvim</code> you’ll execute the right thing! First check which shell you’re running:</p>
<pre>% echo $SHELL</pre>
<p>Then append these lines to your appropriate file. Leopard uses bash by default but given I’m a FreeBSD guy I still prefer tcsh.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>For bash, <code>~/.profile</code>, <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or <code>~/.bashrc</code>:</strong><br />
<code>alias vim="mvim"</code><br />
<code>alias vi="mvim"</code></p>
<p><strong>For tcsh, <code>~/.tcshrc</code> or <code>~/.cshrc</code>:</strong><br />
<code>alias vim "mvim"</code><br />
<code>alias vi "mvim"</code>
</p>
