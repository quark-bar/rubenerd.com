<p>You remember when I posted about that women who was being rude to me on Twitter? Looks like <a href="//rubenerd.com/womanwithbite/#comment-1164">her account was suspended</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="//rubenerd.com/womanwithbite/#comment-1164"><p>WomanwithBite won’t be troubling you any more, because (s)he’s been breaching Twitter’s terms of service, regarding abuse etc, (s)he ain’t on twitter any more.</p>
<p>But I’m sure (s)he’ll come back in a different guise.</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s interesting is the person who posted this comment pointed out something I hadn&#39;t even given a second thought to: perhaps <em>she</em> was a <em>he</em>. Not sure how much of a difference if any it would have made when I was reading his/her messages to have been suspicious of that, but given he/she didn&#39;t link to any external accounts and his/her profile didn&#39;t include anything except reels upon reels of rude comments to a handful of people, it&#39;s entirely conceivable the person was a fabrication.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, I wish Twitter would get more serious about spam accounts than just rude people like her. I thought she was harmless :).</p>

<p>I downloaded her page from Google Cache and uploaded it here if you want to read the last few tweets she made, including the one where she called me a clown. If I am a clown, I don&#39;t get paid enough!</p>
