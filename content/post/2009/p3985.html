<p>It’s official, S. Manikumar has won the by-election for the seat of Bukit Gantang for Anwar Ibrahim’s PKR (People’s Justice Party). From <a href="http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/22631-pkrs-manikumar-wins-in-bukit-selambau">The Malaysian Insider:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>SUNGAI PETANI, April 7 — First-timer S. Manikumar has ensured that Bukit Selambau is represented in the state executive council after a hard-fought but convincing 2,403-vote win over Barisan Nasional’s Datuk S. Ganesan.</p>
<p>The PKR candidate polled 12,632 votes to defeat the former Lunas assemblyman who managed 10,229.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This of course is a huge win for Anwar Ibrahim’s PKR party and a particularly embarrassing one for the embattled UMNO coalition which only just recently got a new leader in Datuk Seri Najib Razak who, I have to be frank, scares me a bit.</p>
<p>I barely lived in Malaysia for over a year, but I still like to keep informed with what’s going on. It’s proximity to and shared history with Singapore where I lived since the mid 1990s also means what goes on there has a rippling effect. Plus I want to know how it’s affecting my friends over there.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> If you’re one of my regular readers outside South-East Asia and I’ve lost you with this post, I hope to write more about this and to do some more explaining sometime later this week.</p>
<p>In the meantime if you’re interested, Wikipedia’s articles on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_Ibrahim">Anwar Ibrahim</a> and to a lesser extent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parti_Keadilan_Rakyat">The PKR</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UMNO">UMNO</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumiputra#Controversy">Controversy section of the Bumiputra article</a> give you a pretty good idea. To say Anwar has put up with and been the victim of political mudslinging is the understatement of the millennium.</p>

<p>Congratulations to S. Manikumar, The PKR and to Anwar Ibrahim. Merdeka!</p>
