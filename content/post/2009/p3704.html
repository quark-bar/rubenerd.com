<p>For those of you like me who use a flavour of UNIX (Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Linuxâ€¦) but at some point are stuck using a Windows computer, the built in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490910.aspx">Command Prompt FTP client</a> can throw you off for one simple reason: Windows goes against what everyone else does (<em>yet again!</em>) and defaults to <code>ASCII</code> for file transfers instead of <code>binary</code>. This means any non-plain text files you upload via FTP will become corrupted and unusable.</p>
<p>Little tip for those doing this, make sure once you&#39;ve logged onto an FTP server to type the &quot;<code>binary</code>&quot; command first before you do anything else. Windows will confirm the change by printing &quot;<code>200 Type set to I</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>Another small Windows platform difference along the lines of my <a href="//rubenerd.com/ifconfig-versus-ipconfig-versus-ifconfig">ifconfig versus ipconfig</a> post I also wrote this month that regular Windows users probably already know, but passing it on for what it may be worth. I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis.</p>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490910.aspx">Microsoft&#39;s TechNet</a> has more details.</p>
