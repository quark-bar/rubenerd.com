<p>My shrink and good friend in Alaska <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/User:Jimkloss">Sir Jim Kloss esq.</a> suggested I <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/life-stress-whatnot/#comment-1410">take a break</a> from computers and see some nature. I didn&#39;t have time to take an entire day off, but on Monday morning for several hours I left the house and walked around the gardens in Mawson Lakes taking photos. It did me the world of good.</p>

<p>I took far too many [amateur] photos to upload all at once, so I&#39;m staggering them over a few days. Today&#39;s selection are all the photos I took of avian friends. Well they weren&#39;t really friends, aside from the ducks they all flew away as soon as I got close :).</p>
