<p>I often find I can understand things better myself when I explain what I&#39;m attempting to do. Spock would probably say this illogical, I&#39;d retort that not all of us have the benefit of being half Vulcan. Thank you.</p>
<p>Since attempting to boot my MacBook Pro with OpenSolaris and <a href="//rubenerd.com/opensolaris-macbook-pro/">since writing about it here</a> an hour ago I&#39;ve learned more about the problem I was having with the partitioning stage.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://wikis.sun.com/display/chosug/OpenSolaris+2009.06+on+a+MacBook+Pro">found this page</a> and on their instruction I installed the <a href="https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_SMI-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=SDDT-2.2-MP-G-F@CDS-CDS_SMI&#038;Origin=ViewProductDetail-Start">Sun Device Detection Tool</a> which checks the hardware of machines and determines whether or not OpenSolaris and Solaris have appropriate driver support. Aside from the gigabit Ethernet card, I was told my original generation MacBook Pro had full hardware support. Cool.</p>
<p>Returning to the aforementioned page I saw the screenshot shown above and recognised the errors instantly from when I tried to install OpenSolaris myself. Turns out OpenSolaris needs to be <strong>installed on the first partition</strong> to work; I was attempting to install it on the third partition after the EFI and Mac OS X Leopard ones respectively.</p>
<p>I could mess around for another few hours to try and figure out how to overcome this limitation (when I was an early teenager I was quite the dual-booting wizard) but I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll save myself the headache, backup my data and repartition this machine from scratch.</p>
<p>As I said in my previous post about this, this semester I&#39;m working almost exclusively with Java and Oracle software and I&#39;m SSH&#39;ing into Solaris machines at the campus here already, and I&#39;d like to be able to use a similar setup on my own machine too. Also I love trying new things :).</p>
