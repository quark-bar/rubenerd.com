<p>Photo taken with my iPhone this afternoon in the deli section of the supermarket in Tanglin Mall here in Singapore. The sign reads: <strong><em>&quot;Cheeses: the perfect addition to any cheeseboard&quot;</em></strong>.</p>
<p>No, really!? Cheeses are the perfect addition to a… cheeseboard? ^_^</p>
<p>I wonder if Bill Kurtis is aware that cheeses are the perfect addition to any cheeseboard? As of this afternoon at least I can say with confidence that I am now aware of this. How… cheesy. Oh come on, you could see that coming.</p>
