<p>It&#39;s official, the American megachain <a href="http://www.costco.com.au/">Costco</a> has opened their first store in Australia and the Southern Hemisphere with plans to open more stores in Melbourne and Sydney:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.costco.com.au/"><p>Costco is a membership warehouse club, dedicated to bringing our members the best possible prices on quality brand-name merchandise. We provide a wide selection of merchandise, plus the convenience of specialty departments and exclusive member services, all designed to make your shopping experience a pleasurable one.</p>
<p>Costco Wholesale Australia will open its first warehouse to the public on 17 August 2009, in Melbourneâ€™s Harbour Town Docklands.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently there are <strong>no plans for an Adelaide store yet</strong>. What a shame ;-).</p>
