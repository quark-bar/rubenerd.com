<p>Well here we are folks, I&#39;ve gone ahead and done it! After talking about doing it for over three years I&#39;ve finally merged all my disparate blogs into one. It was easier when the <a href="//rubenerd.com/anime-restarting/">last external blog was wiped</a> which forced me to start again anyway! There are still a lot of broken links, but I&#39;m working on them.</p>
<p>As for the haphazard work-in-progress design, I made it as platform neutral as possible so I can easily port it over to <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> once WordPress has driven me insane enough to warrant it. As before it still uses <strong>no JavaScript or Flash</strong> except when a specific post requires the latter and I can&#39;t find an alternative. It also doesn&#39;t look <em>too bad</em> in Internet Explorer 6 which was a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking forward to only maintaining one personal site for a while, it&#39;s going to be a refreshing change. Wasn&#39;t that a Little River Band song?</p>
<p>Might as well also take this opportunity to also ask that if you read my blog through my web feed I encourage you to update your aggregator to point to <a href="//rubenerd.com/feed/">rubenerd.com/feed/</a> instead of <a href="//rubenerd.com/feed/">rubenerdshow.com/feed/</a>; it&#39;ll reduce the number of requests to my server and make it a bit faster than using the redirect I have in place. Thanks :)</p>
