<p>Not that I&#39;m addicted and suffering from withdrawal symptoms or anything. Hope all the construction going on in our neighbourhood here hasn&#39;t broken or damaged any phone cables. Anyone else in <a href="http://www.mawsonlakes.com.au/">Mawson Lakes</a> or other northern suburbs of Adelaide having internet trouble with <a href="http://internode.on.net/">The Node</a>?</p>
<p>In an ironic twist, I can also see I made a <strong>critical mistake</strong> with my super detailed diagram too. I&#39;ll pretend I did it on purpose for a reason so inspired I haven&#39;t even thought of it yet.</p>
