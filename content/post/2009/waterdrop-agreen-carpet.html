<p>Both these photos were taken in Mawson Lakes with my beloved little Nikon D60. I only had my 18-55mm kit lens with me instead of my prime 35mm f/1.8 but I think they came out okay. Aside from a little cropping/scaling they are exactly as they were taken without alteration and all that whatnot.</p>
