<p>Thought I’d give you all another quick update regarding my spam efforts. The Akismet plugin hasn’t had to filter any spam now for weeks because <strong><a href="http://tantannoodles.com/toolkit/spam-filter/">TanTanNoodles Simple Spam Filer</a></strong> has been blocking <em>all</em> of them! Not 99.99% or some <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-10201725-71.html">completely fabricated Google number</a>, I really mean all of them!</p>
<p>According to it’s configuration screen, it’s blocked <strong><code>18914</code></strong> spam messages since going online recently. I couldn’t be happier with the results.</p>
<p>If you were planning to use the <em>Buy Ruben a Coffee</em> link on the side of the site here today, I encourage you instead if you have a WordPress blog to download SSF and donate to it’s creator instead.</p>
