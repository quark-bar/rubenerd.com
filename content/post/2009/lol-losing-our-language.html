<p>Ladies, gentlemen and everybody else, I have an announcement to make.</p>
<p>If anyone &#8212; and I do mean anyone &#8212; sends me an email, a text message, a Twitter reply or a Twitter direct message, a blog comment, a discussion point on a wiki, a reply on a forum, a message attached to a carrier pigeon or a smoke signal and assumes that because I&#39;m under the age of thirty that I would appreciate the inclusion of the misused and abused acronym <strong><em>&quot;lol&quot;</em></strong>, it will no longer be responded to with irritation… <strong>it will generate no reply whatsoever</strong>.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a close friend or family member, or if you&#39;re house is burning down, or whether you&#39;re a close friend or family member who&#39;s house is burning down, you will not get any reply. Zippo. Zero. Zilch. Zbignew Brezinsky. That reminds me, I need to review his latest book at some point. In one word: <em>eye opening</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> Come to think of it why you would be sending me a &quot;lol&quot; message if you’re house was burning down is beyond me. <em>&quot;hey rubz my house is totally burning down lol&quot;</em>. You evil insurance scamming person with little to no grasp of the English language!</p></blockquote>
<p>Still, don&#39;t try to change the subject. As I was saying before you rudely interrupted me by talking about your house and Zbignew Brezinsky&#39;s latest book, if you sendeth me the cursed <em>&quot;lol&quot;</em> you will not receiveth any communique from moi… <strong><em>no exceptions</em></strong>!</p>
<p>Thank you, and good evening.</p>
