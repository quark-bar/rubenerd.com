<p>Huge <strong>Happy Birthday</strong> going out to Commander Keen himself <a href="http://twitter.com/oliyoung/">@Oliyoung</a> who as of 10 minutes ago South Aussie time <a href="http://blog.oliyoung.com/post/260714478/i-turn-30-tonight">turned 30</a>! I&#39;ve never met him and have only conversed through The Twitters so therefore I can&#39;t entirely be sure he exists as per the <em>Schrödinger&#39;s Turing Machine Cat Box</em> thing, but if he does I&#39;m sure he&#39;s even more awesome in person :). Suffice to say I hope I have <a href="http://blog.oliyoung.com/post/260714478/i-turn-30-tonight">as many amazing things</a> to add to my 20s list when I turn 30!</p>

<p>In recognition of this event, I declare <strong>The Word</strong> to be <strong>Oli Young</strong> for the duration of today and not <strong>Bird</strong>. Yes the irony hasn&#39;t escaped me that I replaced <strong>The Word</strong> with <strong>Two Words</strong>, but if that really bothers you I suppose you could <em>hyphenate</em> it. <em>Hyphen</em> sounds like something Professor Frink would say. <em>Operation Hyphen Maven!</em></p>
<blockquote><p>
A-well-a, everybody’s heard about <strong>Oli Young</strong>!<br />
<strong>Oli Young</strong>, <strong>Oli Young</strong>, <strong>Oli Young</strong>, <strong>Oli Young</strong>&#8216;s the word!<br />
Papa ooma-mow-mow, papa-ooma-mow-mow!

<p>I think I&#39;ve had too much egg nog. Happy birthday anyway mate :)</p>
