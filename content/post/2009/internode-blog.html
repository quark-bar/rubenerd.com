<p>Having lived most of my life in countries where they don&#39;t do this, all internet service providers in Australia automatically suck and are Epic Fail because they employ nonsensical (and maddening!) bandwidth shaping, but out of all of them <a href="http://internode.on.net/">Internode</a> sucks the least. Aside from <a href="//rubenerd.com/stole-mid-semester-break/">one disconnection issue</a> they&#39;ve been fantastic since I started studying in Australia again late last year. Their technical support team are <a href="//rubenerd.com/internode-reactivation/">lightning fast and very helpful</a>, so I have no qualm giving their new blog a plug.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Internode Customer,</p>
<p>Internode has just launched its new public blog site:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.internode.on.net/blog">http://www.internode.on.net/blog</a></p>
<p>The site launch commences with our coverage of the Global Green Challenge (<a href="http://www.globalgreenchallenge.com.au">http://www.globalgreenchallenge.com.au</a>).</p>
<p>Internode is the major commercial sponsor of the event, and we are taking the Internode Tesla Roadster from Darwin to Adelaide in the &#8216;Eco Challenge’ category.</p>
<p>The Tesla Roadster is an exemplar of the way that &#8216;green’ and &#8216;high performance’ can go together &#8211; just like Internode.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy our coverage of the event as it unfolds.</p>
<p>We plan to expand the blog site into other areas of interest to Internode customers in the future.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>The Internode Team</p></blockquote>
