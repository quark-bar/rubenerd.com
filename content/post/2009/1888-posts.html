<p>Well there you go, I&#39;m so quick to celebrate pointless milestones here I even have a <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">dedicated tag</a> for the things, but when something genuinely interesting happens I completely miss it. In an ironic comedic twist, Rubenerd Blog post number 1888 was about the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/2009-06-08-twitter-fail/">2009.08.06 #TwitterFail</a> of all things. How terribly inauspicious!</p>
<p>For those of you who don&#39;t understand the significance, I grew up in Singapore and the number 8 holds a great deal of significance in Chinese culture because it&#39;s perceived as being especially lucky. Conversely, the number 4 to them is as spooky as 13 in Western culture because when pronounced it sounds similar to the word for death. <a href="http://www.weirdasianews.com/2008/08/25/china-attraction-to-numbers-and-their-meanings/">WeirdAsianNews.com has a detailed post</a> explaining numbers and their Chinese meanings if you&#39;re interested.</p>
<p>As a proud skeptic I don&#39;t lend superstitions much credence, but it&#39;s still cool to have reached a post number that has three eights in it again. I just wish such things like blog posts with eights in them brought me as much luck as they were supposed to! I&#39;ll pretend I was supposed to be hit by a bus today but because I posted 1888 entries such a disaster was averted. Yeah, that works.</p>
