<p><a href="http://www.scripting.com/">Dave Winer</a> asked us <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/06/25/theMythOfPerfection.html">what our most desired feature for Twitter was</a>. My thoughts haven&#39;t changed since early last year:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/06/25/theMythOfPerfection.html"><p>I’ve found virtually every tweet is a comment with a hyperlink. This limits the number of characters for the comment and forces us to use URL shortners. &quot;URL shortner&quot; sounds like a cake. So my most desired feature would be to have a separate field for the link to &#8220;associate&#8221; with each tweet. We could do away with URL shortners entirely (no more obscurity and middlemen that could potentially break), and we’d have the full 140 characters to comment.</p>
<p>Given I live in two different places my other wish would be allowing us to define a timezone override for individual tweets when we’re outside our defined timezone in our profile.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d also love for Twitter to make me trillions of dollars, to find cures for all diseases, to usher in world peace and to get me an introverted girlfriend, but I guess we all have to prioritise :).</p>
