<p>The incredibly witty British actor and now Twitter user <a href="http://stephenfry.com/">Steven Fry</a> for whom I and my whole extended family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bit_of_Fry_and_Laurie">have always had plenty of time for</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeeves_and_Wooster">even more time for</a>, asked a question on Twitter today regarding <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a>.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just say I tried my best, but I still have much to learn. What was it my grandfather on my mum&#39;s side always said? <em>&quot;Ruben, you tried your best, but you still have much to learn&quot;</em>.</p>

<p>Must start watching more British television again, in particular British comedy. Absolutely the best in the world, and don&#39;t let anyone else ever tell you otherwise! Don&#39;t let people tell you I&#39;m Bill Kurtis either, because I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis.</p>
