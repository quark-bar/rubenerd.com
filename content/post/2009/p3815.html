<p>If you’re a <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Mozilla Firefox</a> user and you haven’t installed the <a href="http://www.codefromthe70s.org/sslblacklist.aspx">SSL Blacklist add-on</a> from <a href="http://www.codefromthe70s.org/">CodeFromThe70s.org</a> yet, you should absolutely go there right now and click the <code>sslblacklist-4.0.30.xpi</code> link. By installing this plugin you can help protect yourself from suspect SSL root certificate authorities, as well as make sure the sites you’re visiting are no longer using the <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/">demonstratively flawed</a> MD5 hash algorithm. </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> I’d argue this plugin along with NoScript are the two greatest arguments for using Firefox. No other browser with these plugins are a match. I feel naked, cold and scared using anything else now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>MD5 is still <em>probably</em> safe, but the fact it has been shown to have problems should alert people running websites to move over to an SHA hash instead. If you find such a site, you absolutely want to <strong><em>let their admins know about it</em></strong>.</p>
<p>So far I’ve installed SSL Blacklist on my dad’s, sister’s and my machines and we’ve been warned the following sites are using MD5:</p>
<ul>
<li><a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a></li>
<li><a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> (UPDATE: Are no longer using)</li>
<li><a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://neopets.com/">Neopets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If we find any more we’ll add them to the list. Feel free to post a comment with links too. Be careful though, my spam filters block anything with more than three links so you may need to space them out. Cheers.</p>
