<p>It seems that fix for the Huawei USB SingTel Mobile modem I <a href="//rubenerd.com/singtel-huawei-e180-snow-leopard/">painstakingly detailed</a> last week has stoppedâ€¦ fixing. Stopped working. Like a Monty Python parrot, it has ceased to exist. What&#39;s worse is the error message is informing me I have to contact myself. Don&#39;t they know talking to yourself is the first sign of madness? I mean, I talk to myself enough as it is.</p>
