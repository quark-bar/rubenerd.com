<blockquote><p><strong>Update:</strong> It’s been brought to my attention that not defining primary keys as not null does have an impact after all, <a href="http://rubenerd.com/oracle-notnull-pk/#comment-1428">refer to Dale McGowan’s comment below</a>. Suffice to say, I will continue to define them as not null from now on!</p></blockquote>
<p>Much like a musician who despite getting the right sound realises they&#39;ve been playing their instrument wrong throughout their career, I often find I&#39;m not using computer software properly or I&#39;ve been wasting effort. I guess I get myself into a predictable routine that I&#39;m used to.</p>
<p>In this case I found out something about <a href="http://www.oracle.com/database/enterprise_edition.html">Oracle databases</a>. I&#39;ve been using them for years, but it took a <a href="http://www.cis.unisa.edu.au/">practical class at university</a> yesterday to realise I&#39;ve been wasting time with a simple line of code that was <strong>completely unnecessary</strong>.</p>
<p>If you do any sort of work with databases you&#39;d probably want to smack me on the head for this, but I didn&#39;t know that primary keys are automatically assigned as not null; presumably because it doesn&#39;t make logical sense and it would break a table to have a primary key that has null values!</p>
<p>Up until Friday this is the schema I would have created and entered into an Oracle database:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
create table Jackarse (
  refID char(6) not null,
  name varchar(32),
  grilledCheeseSandwich boolean,
  primary key (refID)
);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>And here&#39;s what I&#39;ve since learned I can do instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
create table Jackarse (
  refID char(6),
  name varchar(32),
  grilledCheeseSandwich boolean,
  primary key (refID)
);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s right, both these schemas will result in the <strong>same table being created</strong> in Oracle. I guess it wasn&#39;t harming anything having the not null command there, it was just unnecessary.</p>
