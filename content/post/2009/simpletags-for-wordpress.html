Couldn&#39;t think of any other picture to put here!</cite></p>
<p>When I started using it for this blog back in 2006, <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> didn&#39;t have native tagging abilities. The <a href="http://www.neato.co.nz/ultimate-tag-warrior/">Ultimate Tag Warrior</a> was the most popular third party plugin to provide them at the time as evidenced by the importer available for it in more recent WordPress versions. I chose not to use it because I&#39;ve never been comfortable with plugins altering my blog&#39;s database.</p>
<p>The solution I found at the time was <a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://www.broobles.com/scripts/simpletags/">Broobles&#39; SimpleTags</a> which allowed tags to be defined within the text of a blog post either inline or in a block. When the post was rendered the plugin would generate a nice list of Technorati tag links with the <code>rel=&quot;tag&quot;</code> attribute so they&#39;d be recognised as such. No muss, no fuss.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> All posts here that used SimpleTags have since been mass tagged with the <a style="font-weight:bold" href="//rubenerd.com/tag/simpletagged/">simpletagged</a> tag using WordPress’s tagging system. That’s right, I have an internal tag for posts that have been tagged in another system. I also had a grilled chicken sandwich for lunch, and I don’t hear anyone complaining.</p></blockquote>
<p>When WordPress implemented tagging support I stopped using SimpleTags, meaning most of my posts from 2006 (and very early 2007) still have them. Fortunately SimpleTags still works even with the latest versions of WordPress so I can keep it installed to generate those links. For example, I can define a few right here:</p>
<div class="tags" style="font-style:italic;"><a href="http://technorati.com/profile/rubenerd/"><img style="vertical-align:bottom; margin:0px 5px 2px 0px; width:80px; height:17px; display:inline;" src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/media.tags.png" alt="Technorati Tags" /></a> <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/tags" rel="tag">tags</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/tagging" rel="tag"> tagging</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/simpletags" rel="tag"> simpletags</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/wordpress" rel="tag"> wordpress</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/php" rel="tag"> php</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/plugins" rel="tag"> plugins</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/grilled+cheese+sandwiches" rel="tag"> grilled cheese sandwiches</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/jaffles" rel="tag"> jaffles</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/software" rel="tag"> software</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/reviews" rel="tag"> reviews</a></div>
<p>That was fun, I haven&#39;t done inline tags in a long time!</p>
<p>Even though I&#39;ve moved over, I can see situations where SimpleTags would still be preferable to using WordPress&#39;s tagging abilities. Unfortunately (in my opinion) WordPress handles tags very much like categories in your blog database, meaning if you don&#39;t want your tables to get ridiculously huge and therefore take longer to backup, you have to be more restrictive in your tagging. With SimpleTags you can tag a post with as many as you want; I remember on many posts I would include several different spellings of the same word, and with posts about software I&#39;d include a generic name tag along with a more specific name and product version tag.</p>
<p>So I did end up reviewing SimpleTags, it just took 4 years to do it ^_^.</p>
