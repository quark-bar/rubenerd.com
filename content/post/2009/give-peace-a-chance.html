<p>40 years ago today John Lennon and Yoko Ono asked the world to give peace a chance, and here we are in 2009 and not a damn thing has changed. If people of my generation play our cards right many of us will still be alive in the [20]60s… and I&#39;ll bet we&#39;ll still be at war over something.</p>
<p>In the hippy spirit of my <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/dedication/">groovy late mum Debra Schade</a> and John Lennon, both of whom were taken away from us far too soon, peace out.</p>
