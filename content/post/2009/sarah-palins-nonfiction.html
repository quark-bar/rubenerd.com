<p>It&#39;s <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/audible/">another Audible</a> blog post; one would think I&#39;m a beginning to develop an obsession. In this case though it&#39;s their filing of Going Rogue <em>[allegedly]</em> written by Sarah Palin under… <strong><em>Nonfiction</em></strong>. I tell you what, when all is said and done, it&#39;s good to see the database maintainers on Audible have a sense of humour… by golly, you betcha!

<p>In related news, I&#39;m terrified both of Sarah Palin and the fact she&#39;s being taken seriously by so many people in the US. I&#39;m dead serious. It makes be break out in a cold sweat thinking just how close she became to essentially being vice president of Earth in 2008, and how she&#39;s already being tipped for 2012.

<p>You know what, I might listen to the book though, if only to be fair. I wonder if she read Dreams from my Father?</p>
