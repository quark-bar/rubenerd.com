<blockquote><p><strong>PICARD:</strong> Do you not find it even just a <strong>bit</strong> amusing that you asked me to help you interpret data… given your name is Data?<br />
<strong>DATA:</strong> I do not sir. The events of Star Trek Generations have not yet occurred and as such I do not currently have an emotion chip installed with which to find such an observation amusing.</p></blockquote>
