<p>For those of you who haven&#39;t had the chance to check it out yet, my good Twitter friend and a very smart guy Rodrigo Haenggi in Switzerland has <a href="http://www.codegestalt.com/blog/">started a blog</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yay, here goes my first blog post on the new site! How are you doing? My name is Rodrigo Haenggi I’m 21 years young and I’m an aspiring OS X / Web developer. This blog will be covering my thoughts, computer science and some anime related stuff. I hope you enjoy the stay and please, feel free to post some comments!</p></blockquote>
<p>His interests and site description match my own so much its uncanny! I&#39;m really looking forward to reading his posts.</p>
