<p>I’m sitting here at the <a href="http://www.theboatdeck.com.au/">Boatdeck Cafe</a> this Sunday afternoon with just my iPhone and a stable wireless network. Sometimes I need to lug the glorified monitor and keyboard stuck together, but today just typing on this feels fine.</p>

To the astonishment of many a person in the real world and online I’ve readily admitted I prefer overcast days; there’s something about them that allows me to relax more. Perhaps it was the positive cool change overcast days have on tropical climates that made me think of them positively.</p>
<p>Mugachinos are good!</p>
<p>As for today, despite university now being back for a fortnight now I’ve still been having a nagging enrollment issue that I thought would have been fixed but clearly not, so I had intended this afternoon to work on that, but unwittingly I forgot the online enrollment system isn’t functional on Sundays! Or at least the part I’m trying to access. I still haven’t even got a new student card yet!</p>
<p>So to be productive I’ve been watching some more Code Geass and going to the Boardeck Cafe! I figure my life is so dreadfully confusing and filled with anxiousness and dread that a Sunday where I only have a few responsibilities is, for an Atheist wanting a better word, a godsend! Plus it’s overcast, good times!</p>

<p>I’ve also finally recorded a <a href="//rubenerd.comshow.com/">Rubenerd Show</a> again, the <a href="//rubenerd.comshow.com/archives/show267/">first since coming back to Adelaide</a>. I had forgotten that I was supposed to be keeping shows under 10MiB so people on iPhones and iPod Touches (the phrase <em>&quot;iPod Touches&quot;</em> just doesn’t sound right, if you know what I mean) can download them on mobile phone networks, so I rambled on just as I’m doing here without any thought to the time until it was just time. The result was I had four things I wanted to discuss and I ended up discussing one thing, then getting sidetracked and talked about something else! Good times.</p>
<p>Well that’s my Sunday! Now if you’d excuse me, I’m going to turn to the Stanza iPhone app and continue reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Count_of_Monte_Cristo">The Counte of Monte Cristo <span style="font-size:x-small">[Wikipedia]</span></a> while I finish my Mugaccino. Sundays are fun.</p>
