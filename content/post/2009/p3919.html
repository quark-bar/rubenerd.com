<p>Yesterday I noticed on Google Reader that <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/">Jim Kloss</a> approved of <a href="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd/status/1373104571">my tweet regarding a Hummer</a> which had parked just outside the <a href="http://www.theboatdeck.com.au/">Boatdeck Cafe</a> I was having a coffee of all things in:</p>
<blockquote><p>@<a href="http://twitter.com/toddtyrtle">toddtyrtle</a> I saw a Hummer parked here in Adelaide this morning. First time I’ve ever felt the need to put a rude sticker on a car.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well in the spirit of this message, here’s that Hummer taken with my iPhone yesterday. Granted at least it’s the smallest model I think, but it still looks like a monster compared to the little Toyota sedan next to it.</p>
<p>I’m not even going that far, I’m learning how to ride a motor scooter so I can zip around town on a Piaggio when I miss the bus or train here and waiting 45 minutes for the next one isn’t feasible.</p>
<p>My dad says a 100cc model up is safer than a 50cc despite my insistence I don’t need anything powerful at all, because he says with the extra power you can avoid messy situations.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.piaggio.com.au/">Aussie Piaggio website</a> is pretty spiffy, you can check out all their models and even the licence requirements for each state! I’ve been told by friends here that depending on how you look at it, South Australia is either one of the best states to learn to drive and ride or one of the worst because they’re much stricter. I’m leaning towards the former.</p>
<p>I love how I can go so far off topic that I start talking about scooters when I take a photo of a Hummer. Do either even have anything to do with the internet or computer software?</p>
