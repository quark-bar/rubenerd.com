<p>While we did live in Singapore most of my life, we did spent a short stint in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia for my dad&#39;s bidness, and I remember all too well when I used to sit at the airport waiting for my sister while I drank coffee at the <a href="http://www.delifrance.com.my/">Délifrance</a>. Julee on Twitter just sent me the photo above a few minutes ago, glad to see its just as I remember it :).</p>

<p>Looking through the super fabulous (ha!) <a href="//rubenerd.com/archive/">Rubenerd Blog archives</a>, I came across this post from January 2007 called <a href="//rubenerd.com/kuala-lumpur-international-airport-wifi-is-sweet">Kuala Lumpur International Airport WiFi is sweet!</a> back when I used to live there. It even had screenshots from my MacBook Pro dual booting Mac OS X and FreeBSD… which I&#39;m still using. How poetic!</p>

<blockquote><p>So I was at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA to people in the know) for a long drawn out reason which I won’t attempt to explain here, and I found myself trying their free WiFi access. Given my experience with TMNet’s WiFi at the Starbucks coffee shops here I was a bit sceptical about how good it was going to be. As it turns out it was faster than out DSL at home!</p>
<p>As you would know if you read this site in any manner resembling regularity I love screenshots, so here are some from my WiFi adventures :D.</p></blockquote>
