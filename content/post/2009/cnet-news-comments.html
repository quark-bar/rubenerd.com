<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/">CNET News.com</a> is rapidly degenerating into a mudslinging centre. Every single news story dealing with Windows has a couple of legitimate criticisms of Microsoft&#39;s business practises followed by tens of posts from people calling them Apple fanboys, on Apple stories the reverse is true. My kingdom for rational discussion!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve decided enough is enough, with the exception of stories from <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p3568/">The Pervasive Datacentre by Gordon Haff</a> who&#39;s writing seems not to draw these kinds of childish antics, this will be my last comment on a CNET Windows story.</p>
<blockquote><p>Putting aside the concerns of prior art (which I believe there is here), let’s be honest here folks. <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10245846-56.html?tag=newsFeaturedBlogArea.0">Most people don’t care about this nonsense</a>, they just want a computer that works. As soon as the general public starts getting messages saying they need to purchase a premium extension to do something extra that other machines could do out of the box, there’s going to be even more negativity.</p>
<p>This whole move along with having 7 different versions designed to confuse consumers, one version of which only allows three applications to run at a time (lunacy) shows how completely out of touch Microsoft is with their customer base. It’s a shame, because Windows 7 has the potential to be much less of a headache to use than previous versions.</p>
<p>The sad thing is, they can get away with it, and they will.</p></blockquote>
