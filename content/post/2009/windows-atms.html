<p>Something to wake you up if you&#39;re having trouble doing so, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2#ATMs">from The Wikipedias</a> this time.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2#ATMs"><p>ATM vendors NCR Corporation and Diebold Incorporated have both <strong>adopted Microsoft Windows XP</strong> as their migration path from OS/2.</p>
<p>Diebold Incorporated initially shipped XP Embedded Edition exclusively, but following extensive pressure from customer banks to support a common OS, switched to XP Professional to match their primary competitor NCR Corporation</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally I&#39;d rather hear people say ATM Machine and PIN Number a million times each than use one with Windows on it. I guess I shouldn&#39;t be surprised, but it doesn&#39;t make it any less blood chillingly scary. It&#39;s also worrying that banks were complicit in and actually pressured ATM hardware manufacturers to adopt these operating systems; these are the institutions that are responsible for looking after our money.</p>
<p>It also doesn&#39;t make much sense, how many solid, reliable and secure embedded OSs are there and they&#39;re running a consumer operating system? That&#39;s like installing Vista on a car&#39;s onboard computer!</p>
