<p><a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/spam/">Spammers</a> often add random sentences to their messages to fool filters, some of which end up being oddly amusing and almost poetic in a bizarre sort of way.</p>

<p>This message was sent to my primary <code>rubenerd.com</code> address and I can&#39;t make head nor tales of it:</p>
<blockquote><p>
You said I was no archer, said Robin Hood<br />
In boat or in horsecart
</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s all there was. No images, file attachments, links to products for sale or sites serving up malicious code. I thought perhaps the spam filters cleaned it, but if it arrived in my inbox it wasn&#39;t considered spam then, right? Perhaps the senders have their server configured to request a reciept which they then use to confirm the email address is legitimate.</p>
<p>In any case, if this is the barrier to entry perhaps I should start writing such messages. Here are some I whipped up while waiting on the phone (and waiting, and waiting) to a medical insurance company.</p>
<blockquote><p>
You said I was no vocalist, said Akiyama Mio<br />
In an embarassing cable tripping disaster
</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
We agreed you weren’t as Irish as me, said Neal O’Carrol<br />
Swimming in a grilled cheese sandwich
</p></blockquote>
