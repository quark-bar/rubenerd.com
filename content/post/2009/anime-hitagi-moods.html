<p>Just like a person who scoffs down several coloured plates then feels too full to have any of the red ones, it has come to my attention that if I posted <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/bakemonogatari/">reviews of Bakemonogatari</a> every day in a row I would exhaust my supply far too quickly. This is also the first time I&#39;ve reviewed an anime series as it&#39;s airing instead of using DVD releases, so I&#39;m having to think of ways to occupy myself while waiting for the next episode.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>From my <a href="//rubenerd.com/anime-bakemonogatari-03/">review of the third episode</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Speaking of eyes (wait, what?), I think it would have made far more sense for the &#8220;password&#8221; for this episode to be <strong>eyes</strong> or <strong>hitagi-eyes</strong>. It was almost as if they adapted the story for this episode to maximise the number of random close up shots the animators could do so they could draw Hitagiâ€™s eyes. I lost count after 14 times.</p></blockquote>
<p>Drumroll please: in this brilliantly composed post of literary genius I present a guide to get to know the <strong>moods of Senjougahara Hitagi</strong>. This is strictly for entertainment purposes only, I absolve myself of any responsibility if you find a staplers in your mouth.</p>
<p>And yes to reiterate, these are all from <a href="//rubenerd.com/anime-bakemonogatari-03/">the same episode</a>. And <strong>this isn&#39;t even a quarter of them</strong>. For your sanity and for my bandwidth I have limited myself to these so far. Arigato.</p>
