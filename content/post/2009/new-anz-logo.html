<p>Much like my friend <a href="http://onsug.com/">Frank Nora</a>, I&#39;m a logo nerd, so when news like this appears I pownce on it. Oh great, that <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/pownce/">failed website</a> has stuffed up my spelling. Big news: The ANZ Bank is in the process of <a href="http://www.shareholdercontactjuly09.com/Our-New-Brand.html">changing their logo</a>.</p>

<p>I first heard about it on Twitter and was directed to an article on the Brisbane Times website (<a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/business/new-brand-logo-to-cost-anz-15m-20091022-hbd6.html" style="font-style:italic">New brand, logo to cost ANZ $15m</a>) which hilariously didn&#39;t contain a single image of it! Fortunately a Google Image search showed me what the fuss was about.</p>
<p>I like it when companies refresh their logos while still retaining a certain familiarity and elements from their previous one, and at least this ANZ one keeps the same striped, bold letters. I&#39;m also relieved beyond belief that their new logo widget didn&#39;t become another over-designed, complicated, ugly, bubblegum, already dated looking Web 2.0 logos that Aussie companies such as Woolworths have fallen victim to (<a href="//rubenerd.com/p3083/" style="font-style:italic">New Woolies logo looks icky and Web 2.0</a>).</p>
<p>I hesitate to say I like it, but I applaud them for keeping things simple.</p>
