<p>Hidey ho everyone, just a quick heads up. While I was able to get the redirects all working well from the <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">old dedicated website</a> to the new <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/show/">Rubenerd Show category</a> here, the <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/show/feed/">new RSS feed</a> has the heading &quot;Rubenerd Blog &gt; Show&quot; instead of &quot;Rubenerd Show&quot; which means if you&#39;re subscribed with iTunes or another client it might mess up your playlists.</p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to find a way to edit WordPress&#39;s <code>feed-rss2.php</code> file to allow for different ones for each category so this will work. I&#39;ve already hacked the theme to allow for separate content depending on categories so I&#39;m hoping this isn&#39;t too much trouble. The new theme I&#39;m working on and will be unveiling next month also does this really well.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll <a href="//rubenerd.com/show268/#comment-1034">drink some Pepsi</a> while I figure this out.</p>
<p>Sorry guys!</p>
