<p>Writing about the <a href="//rubenerd.com/p3693/">recent Frome by-election in South Australia</a> made me remember the lower house state elections back in 2006 when I voted for <a href="http://markparnell.org.au/">Mark Parnell</a> of the <a href="http://sa.greens.org.au/">South Australian Greens</a>. To date he&#39;s been the only politician aside from Bob Brown who has ever returned a message I sent to them. The again, I suspect many members of parliament don&#39;t use those blasted email intertube things :).</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello Mr Parnell, congratulations to you and The Greens South Australia on your won seat following the March election!</p>
<p>I voted for the Greens because I’m a firm supporter of the principals of your party and am very pleased The Greens now have a voice in South Australian politics. You’ve all done an amazing job and I look foward to hearing about how The Greens are changing South Australia for the better in this term and in the future.</p>
<p>Yours Most Pleased,<br />
Ruben Schade</p></blockquote>
<p>His reply, less than a few hours later:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Thanks very much Ruben.  I was sworn in today &#8211; so now it’s down to business.<br />
Cheers,<br />
Mark</p>
<p>Mark Parnell<br />
Greens SA Member of Legislative Council

<p>I really admire Mark, being the lone Green in the state must get pretty intimidating! I appreciate his sense of humour; his down to earth approach to interviews and voting; and surprising lack of hot air when discussing issues. We need more people like him.</p>
<p>Not to mention <a href="http://markparnell.org.au/">his website</a> is pretty slick!</p>
