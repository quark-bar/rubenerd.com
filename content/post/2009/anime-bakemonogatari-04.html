<p>Well after the token effort by Koyomi to help Mayoi in <a href="http://rubenerd.com/anime-bakemonogatari-03/">episode three</a> of <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/bakemonogatari/">Bakemonogatari</a> we finally spend some time with them all walking around the neighbourhood looking for what we later find out is Mayoi&#39;s mum&#39;s house. I&#39;d forgotten for the first few minutes that this was a part two and didn&#39;t understand the significance until I remembered it was Mothers Day. I&#39;m not slow I&#39;m just… wait, did you just call me… slow?</p>

<p>Despite HRH Hitagi allegedly only leaving the neighbourhood a year ago, due to that pain in the arse known as urban renewal the trio are constantly overshooting where they&#39;re supposed to be going. And I thought she was supposed to be a genius; well I guess she said it herself that intelligence is a relative thing isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Anyway despite an exhaustive search with some killer backdrops that alas become a bit tiresome after seeing them several dozen times and despite her calling on Epic Hawaiian Shirt Guy and despite using her mobile phone GPS whatsit they never do find Mayoi&#39;s mum&#39;s house and the return to that gigantic playground. I think that was it. Wait, did you just call me slow?</p>
<p>I was hoping I wouldn&#39;t ever say this about Bakemonogatari, but this was the first episode I saw that I wasn&#39;t terribly fussed about. When I first started watching I was blown away by the production quality and the awesome characters, but even Hitagi&#39;s witty, deadpan-delivered lines that I admit to loving perhaps a little bit too much couldn&#39;t save this otherwise relatively lifeless outing.</p>

<p>As I said in my previous review, often I revel in trivial, silly episodes where very little happens; I made reference to the infamous episode where the story revolves just around Kyon collecting a room heater as being one of my favourites of the series. For this episode though, not so much. Perhaps this series set my expectations a little too high so when it came up with something more mediocre it had much further to fall, if that makes sense. Ah well, here&#39;s looking forward to episode 5.</p>
<p>Oh one thing I did forget, this huge playground park thingy did lend itself further to some <strong>extremely</strong> convenient character placement; for the first time <a href="http://rubenerd.com/anime-bakemonogatari-01/">since episode one</a> (nowhere near enough, I might add) we see the Class President to End All Class Presidents again, though after seeing Mayoi&#39;s and Koyomi&#39;s confrontation all she did was bend down and pat her on the head! Ah the impracticality of it all ^_^.</p>
