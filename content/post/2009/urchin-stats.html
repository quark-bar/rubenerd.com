<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/graphic.kon.wwr.show.xml.twitdeck.jpg" alt="" style="height:351px; width:500px; border:0px; display:inline;" /><br /><cite>Apparently my site summarised in one picture!</cite></p>
<p>Another one of the great things about having your website hosted with <a href="http://segpub.com.au/">SegPub</a> is the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/urchin_software.html">Urchin Analytics</a> package is provided and turned on by default. It&#39;s like <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> on steroids and without the need for JavaScript. It&#39;s also light years ahead of Servage&#39;s crude listing of hits and referral pages.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> This software does some cool stuff but one thing it does <strong>NOT</strong> do is log personally identifiable information. I’ve contacted the support team and confirmed this; if it did log such information I would turn it off.</p></blockquote>
<p>Aside from merging my show and blog together nothing has really changed here, so it means I get a first real look at where my traffic is coming from and what the most popular content is <em>for the first time</em>!</p>
<p>According to the <em>&quot;Top Content&quot;</em> screen, the following are the most accessed parts of this site in descending order, with server only elements like <code>robots.txt</code> removed. After #9 the percentages suddenly drop to statistical insignificance.</p>

<p>While I long suspect as much, it&#39;s now confirmed more people read my blog through RSS readers than visit the site itself. I&#39;ve finally reached the 21st century.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/anime.kokuu.jpg" alt="" style="height:216px; width:500px; border:0px; display:inline;" /><br /><cite>I reckon this picture is even more relevant to this post, but I&#39;d already spent ages on that first picture. Such is life.</cite></p>
<p>What really blew me away was the order of the categories: while I understand the placement of <strong><a href="//rubenerd.com/category/thoughts/show/">The Show</a></strong>, the <strong><a href="//rubenerd.com/category/thoughts/">Thoughts</a></strong> category is ahead of the primary <strong><a href="//rubenerd.com/category/software/">Software</a></strong> and <strong><a href="//rubenerd.com/category/Internet/">Internet</a></strong> ones which (at least I thought) were the reasons for this blog&#39;s existence!</p>
<p>What&#39;s more, the <strong><a href="//rubenerd.com/category/anime/">Anime</a></strong> category of all things is overwhelmingly the most popular. I&#39;m really taken aback… I mean there are thousands of otaku online who dedicate their entire lives to reviewing each episode of every single anime produced in history in painstaking detail, and yet a couple of silly posts mostly talking about passing interests or that are merely tagged as anime because I used an anime desktop background on a screenshot get a #4 position. Wild!</p>
<p>Given I just talk about what I&#39;m interested in at any given time while ignoring cohesion and the supposed number 1 rule of blogging (pick a speciality and just focus on it), perhaps it would be worthwhile to focus my efforts given these trends are what people want. Henceforth I will only discuss what Twitter clients Asahina Mikuru uses while she&#39;s posting her Thoughts on the Rubenerd Show while listening to Whole Wheat Radio, and the subsequent posts will only be available in RSS. I think.</p>
<p>Or alternatively I could just focus solely on discussing <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/grilled-cheese-sandwiches">sandwiches of a grilled cheese nature</a> here and that&#39;s it. Don&#39;t think the thought has never crossed my mind. Jaffles.</p>
