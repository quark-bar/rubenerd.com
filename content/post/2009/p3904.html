<p>All the way back in October 2007 I penned a post <a href="//rubenerd.com/wordpress-extended-rss-fun/">describing some maddening problems</a> I’d be having with the then-new WordPress 2.3 WXR/RSS export feature. The file didn’t contain all my posts, and it was suffering from encoding issues.</p>

<p>This evening here in March 2009 I decided to try exporting this blog using the WordPress 2.7.1 WXR/RSS export feature. The file didn’t contain all my posts, though to be fair it doesn’t have encoding problems. One problem down in almost 18 months, just one more to go.</p>
<p>While a great idea in principal, I officially give up on this feature. Back to phpMyAdmin I go.</p>
