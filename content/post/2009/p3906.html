<p>For a period of time in 2006 I had <a href="http://delicious.com/">del.icio.us</a> automagically create posts here each day containing all the <a href="http://delicious.com/rubenerd/">links I had bookmarked</a> with their service; for security and to make it easier for myself I created a separate WordPress author for it to publish under.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> Interested in what I was bookmarking back in 2006? All these posts were filed under the <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/delicious/">del.icio.us category</a> here. Lots of memories and broken links already ^_^.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I long since decided to turn this feature off because I figured if people wanted to see my del.icio.us links they could just <a href="http://feeds.delicious.com/v2/rss/rubenerd?count=15">subscribe to it’s RSS feed</a>. This means for several years I’ve had a dormant author. I’ve read problems with authors have been responsible for some problems with exporting WordPress WXR/RSS feeds, so I decided to delete it and attribute the posts to myself instead.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.weblog.linksfor.jpg" alt="One of the last delicious exported posts" style="height:288px; width:500px; display:inline; border:0px;" /></p>
<p>The steps to do this seemed simple enough, but I was a bit nervous about the second step! I can confirm though that this works in WordPress 2.7.1.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your WordPress Dashboard and click Users</li>
<li>Hover your mouse over the user you want to delete and click Delete. In my case it’s the aptly named del.icio.us user.</li>
<li>Before the user is deleted you’ll be prompted for the other user you want to transfer authorship of their posts to. In my case, I’m transferring over to Admin.</li>
</ol>
<p>A part of me was sad to delete something created all the way back in 2006, even if it was something trivial like an author on a blog. I reckon my life peaked around then, everything since has been a steep downward slope. Mid-life crisis at 23?</p>
