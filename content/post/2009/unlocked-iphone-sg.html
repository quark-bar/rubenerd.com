<p>Successfully got Optus to unlock my iTelephone, also upgraded to the 3.0 software at the same time. I <em>NEVER</em> get full bars on the Optus 3G network in Australia, go SingTel! (The irony isn&#39;t lost on me that I bag out Optus while praising SingTel by the way!)</p>
<p>There&#39;s something poetic about having a phone connected to a Singapore network that has a weather application for Australia. Is poetic the word I&#39;m thinking of? Maybe I meant grilled cheese sandwich. Yeah, that works.</p>
