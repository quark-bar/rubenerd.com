<p>For those who may be interested, my dad now has an official website over at <a href="http://rainerschade.com/">RainerSchade.com</a>. We may be setting it up as a wiki based system for him to upload and write material to, but for now it&#39;s a simple link page to his Flickr and Last.fm accounts.</p>
<p>Now I just need him to finally get a Twitter account and we&#39;ll be in business!</p>
