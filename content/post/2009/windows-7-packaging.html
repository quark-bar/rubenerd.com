<p><a href="http://apcmag.com/new-windows-7-logo-revealed.htm">According to Australian Personal Computer magazine online</a>, possible packaging and graphics for Windows 7 have been leaked. I&#39;ll spare you my tirade against the new ugly &quot;lens flare&quot; logo specifically designed for this Windows release because I know it&#39;s a subjective thing.</p>
<p>What isn&#39;t subjective is the packaging itself. For the sake of the planet, I sure as heck hope Microsoft doesn&#39;t release Windows 7 and their next versions of Office in those huge, awful thick plastic boxes they did with Vista, Office 2007 and Office for Mac. Microsoft should take a cue from Apple and release their desktop software in one version instead of a ridiculous number which serve only to confuse consumers.</p>
<p>Wait, sorry we were talking about boxes, got sidetracked again. Yes, Microsoft should take a cue from Apple&#39;s packaging of software such as Mac OS X, iLife, iWork and Aperture and release their software in boxes no larger than a CD jewel case and make them out of cardboard instead of plastic. Honestly, all that needs to be in these boxes are the optical discs and perhaps a leaflet with basic instructions, there&#39;s absolutely no reason for software in 2009 to be in boxes that size, and making the entire box out of thick plastic is wasteful and unnecessary.</p>
<p>If Microsoft (and for that matter Apple too, and Adobe, and Quark, and Symantecâ€¦) <em>really</em> knew what they were doing, they&#39;d let everyone not just those with a MSDN subscription to download a disc image of Windows 7 after they&#39;ve paid for a licence. Then we&#39;d avoid even more unnecessary waste, while people with slow connections can still buy physical media. Works for me and FreeBSD.</p>
