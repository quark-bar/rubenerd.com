<p>As you&#39;ve seen I&#39;m somewhat obsessed with privacy and security plugins for Mozilla Firefox. Since writing <a href="//rubenerd.com/firefox-extensions/">my latest list of them</a>, I&#39;ve installed two more that I&#39;m surprised I didn&#39;t discover before.</p>
<p>The first is <a style="font-weight:bold" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/11073">Targeted Advertising Cookie Opt-Out</a> with the cute acronym of TACO. According to the extension description, it sets permanent opt-out cookies to stop behavioural advertising by 84 different advertising networks including Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, all members of the Network Advertising Initiative, and many other companies. What I love about it is it installs cleanly into Firefox without any configuration required.</p>
<p>The second is <a style="font-weight:bold"  href="">Master Password Timeout</a>. If you&#39;re like me and use Firefox to remember your passwords for sites, it&#39;s critically important you assign a master password by going into Preferences &gt; Security otherwise a malicious user accessing your machine could get your passwords in the clear. Master Password Timeout re-locks the master security device after a predefined period of inactivity which is useful if you tend to leave your browser open for long periods of time. Unfortunately it&#39;s not currently available for <a href="//rubenerd.com/firefox-35/">Firefox 3.5</a> but I&#39;m hoping that will change, it works great in Firefox 3.0.11 on my FreeBSD box.</p>
<p>All these extensions might seem like a symptom of paranoia, but personally given the Wild West nature of the Internet and how much of my life I spend on it, I couldn&#39;t think of using anything else at this point.</p>
