<p>I&#39;m getting jittery without it… I haven&#39;t posted a Tweet to my <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenerd">Twitter profile</a> in just under two weeks now!</p>
<p>Curiously I don&#39;t think I fell for any of the recent Twitter phishing exploits, just one day my Twitter account stopped accepting my password. And another curious thing; monitoring my own Twitter profile page I&#39;ve noticed that nobody has sent any fake messages.</p>
<p>Could this be a problem with Twitter instead of a hack or something similar? I can hear you laughing from Alaska Jim! <em>&quot;Dang that Aussie kid and his Twitter crap!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Twitter (and I guess FriendFeed) are nothing like the MySpace and Facebook sites out there! They&#39;re good gosh darn it! They just need a working password that&#39;s all…</p>
