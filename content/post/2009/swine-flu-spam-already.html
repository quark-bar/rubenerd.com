<p>It looks like it didn&#39;t take long for spammers/scammers to start cashing in on swine flu. Doing my weekly sweep of my spam folder do find false positives I saw this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
NY victims of swine flu<br />
Super supplement for natural immunity improving<br />
[URI REMOVED]<br />
Georgine Kildow
</p></blockquote>
<p>While I find all spam designed to scam people out of money or to infect their machines irritating and sinister, scams involving diseases that are killing people just seem worse.</p>
