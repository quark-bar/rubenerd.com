<p>I did the Australian Political Party quiz and gotâ€¦ the <a href="http://greens.org.au/">Australian Greens</a>. I never would have guessed!</p>
<p>I do protest the last line in the description of the party though; yes short term profits will be affected, but to be blunt if we don&#39;t take action now, business won&#39;t matter. We also have to stop valuing a society just on how much money it makes. Money is critically important, but how useful or valuable is it if generating it results in irreversible damage? I&#39;m a huge fan of sustainable economics not just because in the long term it&#39;s the only model that will actually work (refer to the current financial crisis to see this) but because it takes into account social issues and the environment.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not [entirely] a socialist because I think capitalism is still more efficient than governments in determining what gets produced and at what price because purely socialist systems don&#39;t have the market price mechanism to gauge demand in real time. That said, completely unfettered capitalism is efficient only for those in positions of economic and business power, and without [effective!] government oversight and checks, businesses will only serve their own interests and will price goods out of the range of some who need it (think healthcare, food, education). <em>And that none of this matters if we wreck the planet.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps I should just stick to talking about green economics! Standing down from my soapbox now.</p>
