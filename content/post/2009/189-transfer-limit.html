<p>Hehe… whoops! Good thing I just finished a project, sheesh! On the plus side, I guess this means I&#39;m getting more people reading.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I’ve decided to go up to a higher plan with my webhost that has a higher transfer limit. Unfortunately it’s too late for this month which I’ll have to pay a $70+ excess for, but as I said above I’ve decided to frame it in a positive light. It’s funny how I used up all my allocated transfer but still have over 85% of my data space free!</p></blockquote>
