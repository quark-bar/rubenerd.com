<p>Less than a week after claiming victory, the South Australian state Liberal party has conceded defeat in the by-election for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district_of_Frome">electoral seat of Frome (Wikipedia link)</a>. Instead the seat has gone to independent Geoff Brock, the former Port Pirie mayor with 51.7% of the vote. You can read more if you&#39;re interested at the <a href="http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,24975106-2682,00.html">Adelade Now</a> website. Having mixed feeling about it.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> For those who don’t know, Adelaide is in South Australia, and the <em>&quot;Liberal&quot;</em> party are the conservatives/Tories that run against the left leaning Labor party, whom I consider the infinitely lesser of two evils… but still not <em>quite</em> with it!</p></blockquote>
<p>I voted for the Greens in the state and federal elections (Australia&#39;s third largest political party), but I also think a healthy mix of independents who won&#39;t just automatically vote on party lines are critical to a well functioning government. If I read the above article correctly he&#39;s Labor leaning though, which means we might be able to expect where his votes will be going.</p>
<p>In other news, <a href="//rubenerd.com/p3694/">Mark Parnell</a> is still the smartest guy in South Australian politics.</p>
