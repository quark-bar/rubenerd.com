<p>Looking over at DeviantArt this evening I noticed <a href="http://poll.deviantart.com/253/">their latest poll</a> deals with ambidextrousness; given the site hosts drawings amongst other media it&#39;s been interesting to see the results. More importantly, is ambidextrousness a word?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t quite understand it myself, but as long as I can remember I&#39;ve been right handed for writing and left handed for almost everything else. To talk as if I were Spock or Tuvok for a second, logic would dictate the hand with which I write would be the stronger and nimbler of my two hands so therefore I would favour using it for most tasks. When I swing golf clubs, open tin cans, assemble IKEA furniture and grill cheese sandwiches and whatnot though, I tend to find my left hand stronger, more stable and easier to control. If I were to write with my left hand though, the resulting scrawl would be even less legible than my current messy writing I create with my right hand.</p>
<p>Are you right handed or left handed… or more of one or the other but still some of one?  Is ambidextrousness a word? I seem to have asked one of those questions before somewhere.</p>
