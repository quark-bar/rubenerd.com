<p>Great news for us who use Singapore&#39;s <a href="http://www.ida.gov.sg/Programmes/20061027174147.aspx">Wireless@SG</a> WiFi hotspot programme, the free service has been extended to 2013! From <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna/cgi-bin/search/search_7days.pl?status=&#038;search=wireless%40sg&#038;id=436305">Channel News Asia</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/cna/cgi-bin/search/search_7days.pl?status=&#038;search=wireless%40sg&#038;id=436305"><p>SINGAPORE: Singaporeans who have become used to surfing the internet on the go will be able to do so for another four years. […] The government says it will be enhancing and extending the Wireless@SG programme till March 2013.</p>
<p>Acting Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts, Lui Tuck Yew […] said since the launch of the Wireless@SG programme in 2006, the programme now boasts 7,500 hot spots across the country and 1.3 million subscribers.</p>
<p>The new enhanced programme will include improvements to access speeds of up to one megabit per second, double the current bandwidth, and using a new seamless login process.</p></blockquote>
<p>I first talked about Wireless@SG on <a href="//rubenerd.com/rubenerdshow191/">Rubenerd Show 191</a> back in 2006, ironically when I was living in Malaysia.</p>
