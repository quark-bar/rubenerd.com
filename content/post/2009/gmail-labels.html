<p>Remember that maddening <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/230596">&quot;Personalised&quot; Start Menu</a> option Microsoft introduced with Windows and Office that hides certain applications and items you didn&#39;t use as often behind a chevron? Alas it looks like <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a> has been given a similar &quot;feature&quot; as of this afternoon.</p>
<p>When you browse to Gmail now, only a subset of your labels are shown, along with an option to change what&#39;s visible. Fortunately this allowed me to painstakingly click &quot;show&quot; next to each one to display them all again. Neal from the <a href="http://intoyourhead.com/">IntoYourHead</a> show <a href="http://twitter.com/i2yh/status/2434458811">seems to like this though</a>, which leads me to think at the very least Google should have given us the option to disable/enable this function. Unless they don&#39;t think we can handle such a thing. Grilled cheese sandwich irons have handles, and aside from the occasional blindingly painful liquid cheese scaldings I&#39;m fine.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I’ve been told you can click the &#8220;Show All&#8221; link in the Settings&#8594;Labels screen to show all your labels again. Whew!</p></blockquote>
<p>Normally I&#39;m not this harsh (at least I hope I&#39;m not!) but I was so vocally against this when Microsoft did it, and now Google is doing it with Gmail. I really hope this isn&#39;t becoming a trend.</p>
<p>This also raises another issue with this whole Cloud Computing (or whatever the latest 1337 catchphrase is) concept: we don&#39;t really have any control over these web apps.</p>
