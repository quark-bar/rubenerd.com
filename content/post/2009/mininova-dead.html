<p>As of just a few hours ago, <a href="http://www.mininova.org/">Mininova</a> has gone the way of the Suprnova site that preceded it by starting to only serve ambiguously titled <em>&quot;Content Distribution Torrents&quot;</em>, quite a shock given I&#39;d only just been to their site this morning.</p>
<p>I give them a month or two before someone else clones them and we&#39;re right back to where we were before. Again.</p>
