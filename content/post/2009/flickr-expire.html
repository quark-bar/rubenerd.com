<p>For those of you wondering what happened to those photos <a href="//rubenerd.com/break-photos-01/">I promised I&#39;d be uploading</a> a few days ago, alas I&#39;ve let my so-called <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/">Flickr Pro</a> account expire and while I&#39;ve got the money to plonk (plonk?) down for another year, I need to transfer it into my super special separate Visa Debit bank account I use for the intertubes which will take a few days.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I have attached an entirely pointless image from a <a href="//rubenerd.com/sandwich-observation-9">previous</a> Grilled Cheese Sandwich Observation Lesson. I need to do another one of those.</p>
