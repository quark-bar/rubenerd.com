<p>Despite having an Australian iTunes account and having purchased a few random tracks over the years, I’ve largely refrained from buying digital download music online. For me it’s been a case of value for money: sure online downloads are cheaper [most of the time] than an equivalent CD but I don’t have the freedom to rip the audio at quality levels I want for the devices I want. Perhaps the fact I’m also obsessed with future proofing myself plays a part too.</p>
<p>Going to Apple.com today though I found one more reason to dislike audio downloads online ;-). If I wanted yawn inducing, generic, mass produced, disposable, forgettable music I’d tune into a terrestrial Top 40 station. Coldplay aside of course.</p>
<p>Do I sound old yet?</p>
