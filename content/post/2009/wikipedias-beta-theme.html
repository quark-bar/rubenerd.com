<p>If you log into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">Wikipedia</a>, there&#39;s a link in the top right corner that lets you try their new beta user interface. Don&#39;t know how long has it been there, I&#39;ve never seen it before now.</p>
<p>I think the new theme does look classier despite being slightly less efficient with screen real estate. It also introduces an interesting new per-user &quot;book&quot; feature which you can add articles to.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It seems this book feature has been made available for general use in the sidebar not just for people participating in the beta.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if this new theme and new features will be made available for other MediaWiki installs? That be schweeet :D</p>
