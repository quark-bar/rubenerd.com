<p>Having just talked about him yesterday (<a style="font-style:italic" href="//rubenerd.com/olbermann-countdown-podcast/">Keith Olbermann’s Countdown as a podcast</a>), I just found out through his show&#39;s site you can buy a Keith Olbermann bobblehead complete with a little desk!</p>

<a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://www.nbcuniversalstore.com/detail.php?p=88284&#038;v=nbc_msnbc">Keith Olbermann Bobblehead</a> &#8212; Now you can sit down with your favorite MSNBC personality, Keith Olbermann. This new bobblehead features the talk show host seated at his Countdown desk. You’ll have a front row seat for all the action.

<p>I reckon he&#39;d go great with my anime figures, they could all set up some sort of weird newsroom ^_^. If anyone wants to buy me one, let me know and I&#39;ll forward you my address. Don&#39;t all rush to offer at once!</p>
