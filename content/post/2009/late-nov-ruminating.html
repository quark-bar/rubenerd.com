<p>Merlin Mann from <a href="http://43folders.com/">42 + 1 folders</a> once suggested in a podcast that if you want to apply yourself too some creative writing you should start typing and refuse to use the backspace key; just pretend it&#39;s not there. I&#39;m far to obsessive compulsive to follow this advice verbatim because typos freak me out like breakfast cereal without soy milk, but that compulsion aside I&#39;m going to give it a try.</p>

<p>As this evening comes to a close I&#39;m left with a weird feeling of reflection and uncertainty, despite potentially having some direction and purpose. I&#39;m close to finishing my exams, I only have two outstanding assignment issues and the real estate agent in charge of managing my landlord&#39;s property finally got around to inspecting the house prior to the open day on Sunday. The landlord wants to sell.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got <a href="//rubenerd.com/torrenting-freebsd-8/">FreeBSD 8.0</a> gleefully installing on my <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/thinkpad-x40/">ThinkPad X40</a> next to me, my MacBook Pro is frantically compressing a bunch of disc images so I can scrape up some spare gigabytes of hard drive space, the rain outside has stopped but you can still smell it, the ceiling lights are off so the monitors are casting an almost spooky glow and long shadows across the table and down the hall, my bottle of water is empty but I&#39;m still a little thirsty, I&#39;m shaking a little but that&#39;s normal, and because my sister went back to Singapore before me, some pretty, quiet piano playing through the speakers and a quiet hum of computer cooling fans are the only sounds other than the cicadas I can hear.</p>

<p>I still find it infinitely fascinating that on some days I blog a lot, talk to people on Skype and Twitter messages like there&#39;s no tomorrow; on other days despite not having more or less work to do than the day when I was posting five hundred blog entries I can barely bring myself to write one, and when I do get around to posting that lone entry it&#39;s a rambling post with little substance, value or purpose. Hey, like this one.</p>
<p>Well it&#39;s been really nice talking to you, but I&#39;d best be off to bed. I&#39;ll go ahead and sprinkle some hyperlinks through this post, then I&#39;ll hop into bed and distract worrying thoughts by weighing in the pros and cons of using the <a href="http://www.freshports.org/x11/xfce/">Xfce</a> verses <a href="http://www.freshports.org/x11/gnome2-lite/">Gnome-Light</a> ports.</p>
<p>Night.</p>
