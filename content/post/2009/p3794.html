<p>My computer could tell I was half asleep this afternoon and needed an energy boost, so upon plugging in my iPhone it presented me with the above error message. Yikes! Fortunately all I had to do was unplug it and plug it back in again and it worked fine, as if it knew I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis.</p>
<p>Reminds me of this <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/p1128/">scary message</a> I got back in April last year for my 5G iPod.</p>
<p>It&#39;s amazing how a well structured and sufficiently evil looking error message with a scary red exclamation mark stop sign icon can make your heart skip a beat, or perhaps that&#39;s just me. There&#39;s a joke in there about dating, hearts skipping beats and computer error messages in there somewhere, but it&#39;s just not coming to me.</p>
<p>Want to go on a date with me? What do you mean <em>&quot;access denied&quot;</em>? Bummer ^_^.</p>
