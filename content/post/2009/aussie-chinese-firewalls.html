<blockquote><p>&quot;This is a fabrication. We all know [Australian currency] can be used to buy food, drink, houses, and cars. And it can also be used to buy drugs, guns, ammunition, and even prostitutes. Can you say that the [Aussie Dollar] is illegal and committing obscene acts?&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>That in fact <strong>wasn&#39;t</strong> a quote regarding the <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/tag/great-firewall-of-australia/">upcoming Great Firewall of Australia</a>, it was originally about the <a href="http://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/banneddomain-12142009164054.html">Great Firewall of China</a>. That the same point can be made for both should be terrifying.</p>
