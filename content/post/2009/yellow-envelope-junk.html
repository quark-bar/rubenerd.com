<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/3915149668/" title="Junk Mail by rubenerd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2573/3915149668_997d0792e8.jpg" width="500" height="335" alt="Junk Mail" /></a></p>
<p>As a greenie, while <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/spam/">electronic junk mail</a> frustrates me, it&#39;s nothing compared to the frustration I feel when we get snail mail junk here, especially considering we have one of those &quot;No Junk Mail&quot; stickers. I&#39;m starting to think I may have to be <a href="http://twitpic.com/hajd2">more specific</a>. It&#39;s such a waste of resources considering very few people want them and often just throw such crap away away.</p>
<p>This latest piece of [expletive] junk mail disuses itself as a legitimate piece of business correspondence with a proper envelope and fake franked stamp. Upon opening though, its just a huge slab of loose leaf advertisements peddling everything from phone contracts to hit men (I presume). Despite not asking for it (opting in) and having a notice on my mailbox stating I did not want it (opting out) they gave it to me anyway.</p>

<p>I already have contracts with Telstra and Optus alas, but as for the rest I will not be purchasing goods from the following folk for supporting such a dodgy enterprise. I&#39;m not linking to their sites so I don&#39;t inadvertently give them Google Juice, and I&#39;m showing them in a cloud to make it look less icky. Thank you.</p>
