<p>Remember almost one month ago to this day <a href="//rubenerd.com/okay-woolies-you-win/">I registered</a> for a Woolworths Everyday Rewards loyalty card? My primary reason was so I could present the card when I shop at my local Woolies here in Mawson Lakes so the check out folks wouldn&#39;t ever ask me if I had one ever again, and to that end its been a huge success!</p>
<p>Turns out I should have been more cautious after all, this morning I got my first spam message from them, and unfortunately even after reading the <a href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.woolies.fineprint.png">whooping 23 lines of fine print</a> at the bottom of the message I see no way to unsubscribe. I suspect the only way would be to cancel my account.</p>
<p>I guess it&#39;s just transferring the irritation from people asking me for that card over to the realm of electronic junk mail. I&#39;ll admit it&#39;s an improvement, but not exactly what I was looking for.</p>
