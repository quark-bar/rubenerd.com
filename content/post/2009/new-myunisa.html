<p>The <a href="http://unisa.edu.au/">University of South Australia</a> which I am attending for university (surprising though it may seem) recently updated their MyUniSA student home page with more information and swishier graphics. So far I&#39;m liking it to the extent that it&#39;s good to have something new to look at after seeing the same thing for ages, and I like being able to define my own links and see the weather on the sidebar.</p>
<p>Unfortunately they&#39;re still using the dreadful Outlook Web Access interface for email which only works in it&#39;s enhanced mode in Internet Explorer 6 (ugh, don&#39;t get me started!) and granted I&#39;m sure very few of their users use Opera but the menubar looks a bit messed up even in version 10. The latter I can live with, but they really, really, REALLY need to ditch Outlook Web Access.</p>
