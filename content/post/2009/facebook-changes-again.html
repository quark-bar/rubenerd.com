<p>So Facebook has made a bunch of changes, presumably as a result of <a href="http://rubenerd.com/facebook-friendfeed/">buying out</a> and killing FriendFeed, which has resulted in trillions of users forming a group demanding they change back, which has <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/10/27/2725676.htm">made headlines</a> in traditional media outlets, and that Facebook management will ignore. People will learn to live with the downgraded site, and will continue to use it because it&#39;s where all their friends are, and Facebook management will continue to give out data to third parties to perform data mining without assurances of privacy while cackling &quot;fools!&quot; all the way to the bank.</p>
<p>In other news, grilled cheese sandwiches are best made with bread instead of soggy cardboard, an ejector seat works best when there&#39;s an opening in the cockpit roof, and The Bird is The Word!</p>
<p>At this point the only reason I keep my Facebook account open is for people to contact me who still use it. Despite Facebook&#39;s <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p3912/">envy of the service</a> the two are not broadly equivalent, but most of the people I care about are on Twitter now anyway.</p>
