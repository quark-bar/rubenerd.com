<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/flag.biot.png" alt="Flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory" style="height:160px; width:320px; display:inline; border:0px" /><br /><cite>I always liked their flag, even if I can’t call some of them now!</cite></p>
<p>Here’s something I didn’t know, as an Australian with an Optus phone line, <a href="http://personal.optus.com.au/web/ocaportal.portal?_nfpb=true&#038;_pageLabel=Template_woRHS&#038;FP=/personal/homephone/longdistance/barredinternationallocations&#038;site=personal">I’m not allowed to call certain places</a>. When did this happen?</p>
<blockquote><p>Because of an increase in the number of unauthorised call activity and modem-jacking incidents Optus has barred all direct dial calls to the following destinations:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Diego Garcia</em></li>
<li><em>São Tomé and Príncipe</em></li>
<li><em>Guinea-Bissau</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to make a call to any of these destinations, contact Optus Customer Service on 133 937, as access to a specific number may be able to be restored.</p>
<p>Alternatively, connections can be made through Operator Services by dialing 1225 (charges apply).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anybody know anyone in the British Indian Ocean Territory I can call? What about Santo Antonio? Guess I’d better brush up on my Portuguese if I’m going to call someone in Bissau. Wait, I can’t!</p>
