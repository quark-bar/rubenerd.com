<p>Checking my Google Reader page this evening I noticed all of a sudden I have <strong>18 readers</strong> for my main RSS feed here at <a href="//rubenerd.com/feed/">Rubenerd.com</a>, and <strong>34 readers</strong> for the <a rel="nofollow" href="//rubenerd.com/show/blog/feed/">old URL</a> bringing the <strong>total to 52</strong>! I do admit I started blogging because I enjoy writing about my weird and disparate interests first and foremost, but it&#39;s another world of good feeling knowing a few of you are interested in some of it too.</p>
<p><em><code>&lt;Cheesyness&gt;</code></em> So I just wanted to get all soppy for a second and send out a thank you and a hug to all of you for thinking my material here was worthwhile enough to warrant some of the time from your hectic electronic lives. Its a fulfilling feeling that has helped a socially awkward, introverted guy like me in ways you can&#39;t imagine. <em><code>&lt;/cheesyness&gt;</code></em></p>
<p>I&#39;ll try my best to minimise the number of typos and grammar mistakes :). I chose the above photo from my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/sets/72157622471354226/">Flickr account</a> because it looked all dramatic and the primary colour is similar to uncooked grilled cheese sandwiches.</p>
<p>Peace, health and happiness,<br />
