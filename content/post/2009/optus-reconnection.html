<p>Unfortunately one of the problems with essentially living in two different countries is things like bills from phone companies are easy to forget when you&#39;re living in the other place. When I&#39;m in Singapore I have a 3G and data plan with <strong>SingTel Mobile</strong>, in Australia I have a 3G and data plan with <strong>Optus</strong>.</p>
<p>Despite technically being an overseas subsidiary of SingTel, Optus couldn&#39;t be more different. To their <strong>credit</strong> (puns are hilarious!), an Optus account is far easier to apply for than a SingTel account and has much less fine print, but you pay for this initial convenience by having far slower data speeds, spotty 3G reception and a tiny amount of data. Granted Singapore is microscopic compared to the metro area of Adelaide despite having five times as many people, but in Singapore I have full 3G reception everywhere except in lifts. I also have six times the data, for cheaper.</p>
<p>The other thing has to do with late payments of accounts. With SingTel if I&#39;m late they send a series of warning letters and disconnect me, but they&#39;ve always had me reconnected within an hour of my bill payment, even if it&#39;s on a weekend (yes, even Sunday!). With Optus they claim a business day before reconnection takes place, but it&#39;s taken 4 business days each time it&#39;s happened.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not denying for a second it&#39;s entirely my own fault for not paying my bills, but the difference in support and service is huge. Optus needs to get their act together. I&#39;m bullish that they&#39;re capable of it, they just need a nudge. By a huge bull. I&#39;d be scared into changing if a bull came charging at me. Chargingâ€¦ like charging a phone. I&#39;m a genius!</p>
<p>Given I use my iTelephone with these plans, I wonder if Neal from <a href="http://iphoneusernews.com">iPhoneUserNews.com</a> has anything to say about this? Wonder if you get a free Guinness and a potato when you sign up for an Irish telco?</p>
