<p>Beautiful picture, might be my desktop background for a while. The question is whether or not I have the guts to have it as my desktop background on my laptop which will be seen in public.</p>
<p>It&#39;s weird in a way that I&#39;m more than happy telling people online I&#39;m an atheist, but it doesn&#39;t get out much in the real world. I don&#39;t quite know what I&#39;m afraid of, but I&#39;m afraid. I guess that&#39;s what I get for sticking to the only <em>&quot;religion&quot;</em> that people are apparently free to criticise and lambaste.</p>
<p>Funny how certain vocal folks are so hung up about not offending people&#39;s faiths under any circumstances, but those same people are more than happy to incessantly bash atheists. I reckon that qualifies as hypocrisyâ€¦ though to be fair I think we do bring it upon ourselves. People tend to get extremely defensive when their most cherished beliefs are questioned. Then again, if they&#39;re so confident they&#39;re right, why would they exhibit actions and words that in any other realm of discourse would imply uncertainty? Are they simply afraid of our questions because there&#39;s a part of themselves that knows it&#39;s not true, but they don&#39;t want to admit it? Are they fearful of the consequences?</p>
<p>As a human race, we sure have a long way to go.</p>
