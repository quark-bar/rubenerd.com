I&#39;ve still got a dreadful head cold and a high temperature today, but I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m going to be sick and I feel SO much better! I mean 10,000% better!</p>
<p>I know I said this before, but in a selfish way this really makes me appreciate what my beautiful late mum went throughâ€¦ for over a decade. And she said she wasn&#39;t a strong person, biggest load of crap I&#39;ve ever heard!</p>
<p>Off to the GP now for some follow-up. Funny how we never figured out what food it was I ate that made me this sick. I guess we&#39;ll never know. I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis though.</p>
