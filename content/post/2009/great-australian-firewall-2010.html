<p>It&#39;s that nonsensical idea we thought common sense and overwhelming evidence against its effectiveness would kill once and for all, but here we are on the brink of the introduction of the Great Firewall of Australia. Whooptie-friggen-do.</p>

<p>From Liam Tung&#39;s ZDnet Australia article <a style="font-style:italic" href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/communications/soa/Mandatory-ISP-filter-due-mid-2011/0,130061791,339300060,00.htm">Mandatory ISP filter due mid-2011</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mandatory ISP filtering legislation will be introduced around the middle of 2010, after which there will be a one year period to implement and activate the filtering technology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also from ZDNet Australia, Colin Ho made similar remarks to what I&#39;ve been saying about Australia&#39;s global standing in his article <a style="font-style:italic" href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/communications/soa/EFA-Filtering-damages-Australia-s-reputation-/0,130061791,339300064,00.htm">EFA: Filtering &#39;damages Australia&#39;s reputation&#39;</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
Civil rights and online free speech lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia (EFA) today criticised the government’s internet filtering report, claiming civil rights implications should be the focus rather than the technology’s impacts on internet speed and performance.</p>
<p>&quot;It damages Australia’s reputation as a free and open democracy and as a technologically advanced and savvy 21st century country&quot; ~ EFA vice president Colin Jacobs
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve talked about this issue many times before using the <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/nocleanfeed/">nocleanfeed</a> and <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/great-australian-firewall/">great australian firewall</a> tags.</p>
<p>In case you&#39;re unclear as to what my response has consistently been throughout this debacle, allow me to demonstrate with the help of my friend Kyon from Haruhi Suzumiya fame.</p>
