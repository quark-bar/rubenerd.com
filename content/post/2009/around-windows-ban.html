<p>For some people, eating grilled cheese sandwiches with ham in them is against their religion, for some it&#39;s working on the Sabbath. For me Microsoft Windows is <a href="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd/status/3065625566">against my religion</a>, I get around such restrictions by using FreeBSD and Mac OS X, and by having glass doors.</p>
<p>I released that joke into the public domain, feel free to use it. Please, it would make me feel better about not being able to write good jokes.</p>
