<p><a href="http://tyrtle.wordpress.com/">Todd Tyrtle</a> shared an <a href="http://www.good.is/post/cars-cause-most-bike-car-crashes/">interesting article</a> on Google Reader this morning about the myth of cyclists causing more accidents than motorists. I&#39;ve always thought the claim was dubious.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Chris Cavacuiti, a Toronto physician who cycles competitively, started doing some research into how most bike-versus-car collisions happen while recovering from a nasty bike-versus-car collision. His findings:</p>
<p>While there is a public perception that cyclists are usually the cause of accidents between cars and bikes, an analysis of Toronto police collision reports shows otherwise: The most common type of crash in this study involved a motorist entering an intersection and either failing to stop properly…</p></blockquote>
<p>As someone who lives most of his life as a pedestrian and public transport taker I can completely believe this. The number of times I&#39;ve been clipped by cars and have almost been run over when I have the green light at a pedestrian crossing just isn&#39;t funny any more. Well, it was never funny but you get the idea. I look both ways when crossing the street, but cars are much faster than my reflexes and I am. What also irritates me is how often people don&#39;t indicate when they&#39;re turning; it only takes a tiny flick of the wrist for the driver but apparently that&#39;s too much effort for most. This is true in both Adelaide and Singapore.</p>
<p>The problem for people like me and bike riders like Todd is we&#39;re expected to put up with lousy drivers because cars are an &quot;entitlement&quot; when they should be seen as a privilege, and as such bear a certain level of responsibility. Demerit points don&#39;t discourage reckless driving because they just punish actions rather than dealing with the underlying entitlement problem which I think is endemic to our society, much like binge drinking. I could get onto the selfishness of drunk drivers, but I&#39;ve decided to keep that Pandora&#39;s box closed!</p>
<p>There are some people who legitimately need cars, but that shouldn&#39;t excuse everyone from having one and driving them inconsiderately. Safe drivers as well as bike riders and pedestrians are affected by such people.</p>
