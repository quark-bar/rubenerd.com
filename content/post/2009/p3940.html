<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/3392119458/" title="Earth Hour in Mawson Lakes by rubenerd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3623/3392119458_5d2be5c9e6.jpg" width="500" height="334" alt="Earth Hour in Mawson Lakes" style="display:inline; border:0px" /></a><br /><cite>My beloved <a href="http://www.theboatdeck.com.au/">Boatdeck Cafe</a> (extreme left) was the only shop in Mawson Central to observe Earth Hour. They had candles on every table, was kinda romantic :). I sat down for a cup of coffee and a caramel slice.</cite></p>
<p>I have a healthy dose of scepticism regarding this whole <a href="http://earthhour.org/">Earth Hour</a> business and how much of a difference itâ€™s really making to our planet, but I must admit it was kind of a fun thing to take part in :).</p>
<p>These are the photos I took around Mawson Lakes (our suburb near uni) a few minutes ago with my D60. I was nervous about what people would think of a weird guy walking around a neighbourhood at night with a camera, so I bumped up the ISO a few more levels and lowered the aperture number to take the photos faster!</p>
