<p>In case you&#39;re still subscribed to my blog through the old address (pictured above) but don&#39;t follow <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/09454950261221562208">my shared items</a> in <a href="http://google.com/reader/">The Google Readers</a> I&#39;m passing this message I posted along with my sincerest apologies!</p>
<blockquote><p>Sorry for the flurry of blog posts everyone! I had a DNS problem so if you’re subscribed to my blog through the old URL still, you probably just got whacked with two dozen new posts. Forgive me, I’ll try not to let it happen again!</p></blockquote>
<p>While I have the RSS feed from my old side redirecting, if you&#39;re still subscribed through the old address I encourage you to <a href="//rubenerd.com/feed/">move over to the new one</a>, if only because it seems Google Reader updates it more often and is more reliable. Thanks :).</p>
