<p>Today&#39;s Twitter tweet of the day goes to Long Zheng in Melbourne:</p>
<blockquote><p><a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://twitter.com/longzheng/status/4982610257">longzheng</a>: i’m sick of tech &#8220;reporters&#8221; labeling Vista a &#8220;train wreck&#8221;. they’re the ones who derailed a perfectly good OS <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/technology/windows-7/can-windows-7-salvage-vista-train-wreck-20091019-h3mz.html">http://bit.ly/41ngGM</a></p></blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s absolutely right, Windows Vista didn&#39;t have any flaws whatsoever, it was the all the fault of the evil media! I guess it&#39;s true what they say, denial isn&#39;t the only river in Egypt ;).</p>
<p>To be fair, he sometimes posts some really good stuff. I was intrigued by this idea he posted on the 11th, partly because the problem he describes is one I&#39;ve been talking about for a long time myself. I&#39;d be interested to see what happens with it, it sounds like a great idea.</p>
