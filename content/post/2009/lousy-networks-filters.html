<p>This is probably an Optus phone company problem and not an issue with the iTelephone, but on the off chance that I actually got a 3G signal here in Mawson Lakes over these last few days the data connection is so unreliable nothing finishes loading before <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/3903658302/">I&#39;m given an error</a>. Case in point, my Twitter clients routinely return a secure connection failed error, and it took me over 45 minutes to download the latest <a href="http://www.intoyourheadpodcast.com/aaaapodcastblog/">Into Your Head</a> episode over 2G. The irony was 45 minutes was still faster than 3G because the latter just kept timing out.</p>
<p>I&#39;d call Optus using my iTelephone to complain, but the phone connection is so spotty I keep having dropped calls. I would hate to wait on hold with Optus for 6 hours only to have the call drop when a customer disservice representative finally answers.</p>
<p>So here&#39;s my idea, why not spend the money Stephen Conroy wants earmarked for the <a href="http://nocleanfeed.com/">Great Australian Firewall</a> to fix Australia&#39;s lousy phone networks? Because the other irony is crappy networks are doing a much better job than his proposed filter at blocking content and communications!</p>
<p>I sense a conspiracy brewing.</p>
