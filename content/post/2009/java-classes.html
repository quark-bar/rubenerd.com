<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/logo.java.175.png" alt="Classic Java logo" style="height:305px; width:175px; display:inline; border:0em; padding:0em; background:transparent" /></p>
<p>Despite studying it again for several weeks, every time I see I have a Java &quot;Class&quot; on my timetable I chuckle a bit. If you haven&#39;t ever done Java or other object oriented programming before, Java is made up of <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html">classes</a>, therefore the whole glorious thing is a delicious pun. Feel free to laugh.</p>
<p>Tee hee, Java classes.</p>
<p>On a slightly related note, who here thinks the old, impressionist Java logo that I&#39;ve included here was better than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Java_logo.svg">their new stylised one</a>? I can&#39;t be the only one. Or perhaps I don&#39;t want to know.</p>
