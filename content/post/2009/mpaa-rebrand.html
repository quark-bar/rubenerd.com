<p>CNET News.com is reporting in an article with <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-10376839-261.html">another one of their unambiguous URLs</a> that six studios are dissatisfied with the way the Motion Picture Association of America has been going after copyright infringement, so their plan is to call their efforts <strong>content protection</strong> instead of <strong>anti-piracy</strong>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got an even better term to describe their <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/piracy-copyright/">intentionally misleading</a> activities that will save them horizontal screen real estate on their website: <strong>irrelevant</strong>.</p>
