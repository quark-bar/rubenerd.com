<p>Upon reading an article <a href="http://atuuschaaw.blogspot.com/">Atuuschaaw</a> had shared on Google Reader and subsequently clicking the heading for it so I could read more, I came across the <a href="http://www.daylightatheism.org/" style="font-weight:bold">Daylight Atheism</a> blog.</p>
<p>What I want to know is: why can&#39;t I write tag lines as good as that? I must have gone through half a dozen here since I started, and they&#39;ve all been just terrible. <em>&quot;Software and internet commentary that&#39;s occasionally on topic&quot;</em> blows.</p>
