<p>It&#39;s probably a combination of reverse psychology and the need to stick it to the man, but I wonder how many more emails have been needlessly printed since people started following the advice of sites like <a href="http://thinkbeforeprinting.org/">ThinkBeforePrinting.org</a> and started appending &quot;Please consider the environment before printing this email?&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a greenie, I vote for the Aussie Greens political party, I buy stuff from Oxfam, I don&#39;t have or use a car, I take public transport and I vary rarely print anything, but I can&#39;t help but thinkâ€¦ what if their well intentioned efforts are backfiring?</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#39;m just biased because I really dislike rich messages with HTML and have the feature disabled in <a href="http://mozillamessaging.org/">Thunderbird</a>, or in the case of my <a href="http://www.washington.edu/alpine/">Alpine</a> install such a feature doesn&#39;t even exist :).</p>
