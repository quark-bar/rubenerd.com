<p><img style="height:291px; width:240px; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px;" alt="" src="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/logo.worstpresident.gif" /> On Monday <a href="//rubenerd.com/p3677">I posted a discussion I had with someone on Twitter</a> who was adamant that everyone was wrong and that George W Bush would be remembered favourably by people… and he was serious! Upon receiving a tweet from me where I contradicted his assertion, he made a comparison between Bush and Nixon.</p>
<p>Not knowing much about historical American politics I didn&#39;t know if this comparison was apt, so I asked some folks about their opinions and got responses here, in email and in Google Reader. Let&#39;s just say I wasn&#39;t surprised by the responses!</p>
<p>Alex wins the grand prize. I had forgotten how terrible Bush Jr had been for environmental causes too; here in the world outside the US the media seemed to have focused more on his… how do I put this delicately?… less than successful international relations. Alex&#39;s comment about the <em>&quot;perception of western people&quot;</em> was especially spot on.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah it’s true, Nixon was a pretty decent president but Bush is viewed in a negative light for much better reasons. My brother came up with a list of over 45 reasonably sized screw ups like messing up the Environmental Protection Agency, Hurricane Katrina, a bunch having to do with Iraq.. basically he is oblivious to the irreparable damage he’s done not only to the American economy, the American society, the global society, the Eco-systems around the world and the perception of western people in general.</p>
<p>He’s been a disgrace to us all and the only people who approve of him compose the lower idiotic wrung of society here in America. They kind of people who whole-heartedly believe his meaningless rhetoric and feel an obligation toward supporting the neo-conservative republican party.</p>
<p>I’ve lived in Illinois for all of my life and I have maybe met 3 people who approve of his actions. So yes &#8211; history will judge him as an obtuse, unqualified disgrace of a president who got to where he was with corporate contributions and a mutually beneficial relationships with the wealthy, power-hungry, apathetic kind of people who are destroying our planet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone for your emails and comments, I&#39;d like to think I&#39;ve learned something today! I didn&#39;t learn that Bush won&#39;t be remembered favourably though… I knew that already. Did I mention I&#39;m relieved beyond belief he isn&#39;t in charge anymore? I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis.</p>
