<p>A happy Canada Day and Fête du Canada to all those whom this greeting may concern! As I&#39;ve said before here, my father loves your country, he says it&#39;s the most breathtakingly beautiful place on Earth with some of the friendliest people… he did say &quot;warm people&quot; at one point, but given the double entendre regarding climate he changed his wording! I&#39;m determined to visit it myself one day :-).</p>
<p><a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2517/3678289230_152a4c863c.jpg">As for the photo</a>, when my dad came back from Toronto after his last business trip he brought me back a huge flag. Taking a photo of something so lightweight and that&#39;s constantly moving in the breeze was harder than I thought it would be! The white balance is way off given it was taken in the early evening, but I really love the colours as-is.</p>
<p>We Aussies desperately need a new flag as beautiful as the Canadian one. Canada proves you can be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_realm">Commonwealth realm</a> (aka: having the Queen) without needing a boring Red or Blue British Ensign as the basis of your national flag.</p>
<p>Peace, democracy and love… keep showing us the way Canada!</p>
