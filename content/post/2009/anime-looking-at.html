<p>Just spent just over nine hours straight without breaks programming; suffice to say my eyes are protesting but I got the job done! To celebrate, I thought I&#39;d publish a post that&#39;s been sitting in my drafts folder for far too long just waiting for an opportunity such as this.</p>
<p>My question I pose to you is this: What are all those girls looking at? Do <strong>you</strong> have any ideas? They all look interested in whatever (or whoever) it is. Makoto almost looks bemused and Ami is so shocked she&#39;s twisted her leg into what looks like a very uncomfortable position. My theory is Tuxedo Mask probably genetically engineered a rose or something. If we were to take it more literally, if you&#39;re reading this in a blog aggregator they&#39;re probably staring in disbelief at your unread post count!</p>
<p>I&#39;m glad there&#39;s someone out there on the Internet asking the tough questions. We can&#39;t trust newspaper journalists to do that any more.</p>
