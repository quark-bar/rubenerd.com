<p>I&#39;ve been so good these last few weeks restraining myself by not blogging more than five new posts a day, but this sudden, spur of the moment event desperately called for something to be posted… in this case quite literally! Sometimes I have to remind people I&#39;m hilarious otherwise they&#39;d forget you see.</p>
<p>Shortly after it went live here in Australia <a href="http://store.apple.com/au/product/MC223?mco=NzgxMTI1NA">I placed a pre-order</a> for <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/macosx/">Snow Leopard</a>! According to them it&#39;ll be shipped on the 28th.</p>
<p>Take that Windows 7 Starter, Windows 7 Home Basic, Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Business, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 7 Ultimate and Windows 7 Whatnot! :)</p>

<p>And to think it only seemed like yesterday when <a href="http://rubenerd.com/mac-os-x-leopard-launch-in-singapore/">I was in Singapore for the launch of Leopard</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/sets/72157602716725832/">uploaded some photos</a>. Can&#39;t believe that was in 2007, time flies huh?</p>
