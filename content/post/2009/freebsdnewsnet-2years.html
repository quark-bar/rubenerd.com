Frankly it&#39;s just so uplifting to have so many deserving people to to praise in light of the shenanigans of… well, <a href="//rubenerd.com/sony-pictures-ceo-internet/">other people</a>.</p>
<p>On this gorgeous Monday afternoon I wanted to send my belated personal congratulations to <a href="http://www.freebsdnews.net/about/">Gerard van Essen</a> who&#39;s been tirelessly covering the world of <a href="http://freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> and auxiliary projects over at <a href="http://www.freebsdnews.net">FreeBSDNews.net</a> now for <a href="http://www.freebsdnews.net/2009/05/16/2-year-anniversary-freebsd-news/">over two years</a>. As someone who struggled for so long to stay on topic on his own blog that he eventually gave up, I hold even more respect for his conviction!</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.freebsdnews.net/2009/05/16/2-year-anniversary-freebsd-news/">
<p>I’ve been running this FreeBSD news blog for exactly 2 years today. FreeBSD and operating systems have developed and evolved a lot since then; reporting and writing about these have been enjoyable.</p>
<p>Many thanks to everybody who’s notified and emailed me about stories, and those that have left comments.</p></blockquote>
<p>For those who don&#39;t know, Gerard is one of the Core Team members of the <a href="http://pc-bsd.org/">PC-BSD</a> project which aims to make FreeBSD accessible to more people by configuring hardware and installing a <a href="http://kde.org/">graphical environment</a> automatically. If you don&#39;t like Ubuntu or have wanted to try FreeBSD after reading my babble on about here incessantly, you should give it a shot!</p>
<p>I think when we spend so much of our time online digesting news sources and downloading free and open source software, it&#39;s easy to forget there are real people behind them that make them possible. I&#39;ve resolved to give due credit to sites and software I find useful.</p>
