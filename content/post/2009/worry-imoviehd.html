<p>When it comes to simple video editing on the Mac, <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/59414/2007/08/imoviehd.html">iMovie HD</a> that came bundled with iLife 06 is still the best in my opinion. The new iMovie versions that came out with the subsequent versions of iLife were a huge step backwards, but for small projects <a href="http://www.apple.com/finalcutexpress/">Final Cut Express</a> is overkill and <a href="http://store.apple.com/sg/product/MB278Z/A?mco=NDcxNzE5Mw"> far too expensive</a> to justify. Even though I use iLife 08 for other applications, I still have my copy of iLife 06 just for the older version of  iMovie. iUsed a lot of iWords in that sentence iThink.</p>
<p>Problem is, its as <a href="//rubenerd.com/firefox3013/">unreliable as Firefox 3.5</a> which means you need to remember to constantly save. Guess it&#39;s a good thing to get into the habit of doing, but it means when you haven&#39;t saved for a few minutes after positioning frames perfectly in the timeline (which neither iMovie 07 and 08 have) you might have to do it all again. Command+S is my friend!</p>
<p>Aside from this I&#39;m okay with my current setup, my original generation MacBook Pro has a <a href="//rubenerd.com/seagate-hard-disk-shot-my-firewire-port/">shot FireWire port</a> but I&#39;m able to <a href="//rubenerd.com/macbookpro-expresscard/">use an ExpressCard</a> to get FireWire functionality back, and iMovie HD still runs on Leopard just fine. I guess I&#39;m just a little paranoid that any one of these tenuous things could fail and I&#39;ll be up an electronic creek without a paddle.</p>
