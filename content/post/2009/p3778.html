<p>I had completely forgotten about <a href="//rubenerd.com/days-until-bush-leaves-officedays-until-bush-leaves-office">this post I created on the 25th of October 2006</a>, back when we were living in Kuala Lumpur, but reading it back made me smile. It was a link to an automatically updating countdown for the number of days until George W. Bush was out of office. Seems he&#39;s all done now!</p>

<p>The 25th of October 2006 means that counter would have read <strong><em>817 days</em></strong> back then. To quote a Bush fan, <strong><em>By Golly, Gee Whiz!</em></strong> Now the question becomes, I wonder what the world will be like in another 817 days?</p>
