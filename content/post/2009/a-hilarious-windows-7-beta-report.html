<p><a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10139723-56.html">Ina Friend over on CNET News is reporting</a> that Microsoft has made beta versions of it&#39;s Windows 7 operating system available for download. Normally I would have yawned at such an announcement, but given I was waiting for my sister to get ready before we headed out for lunch, I figured I&#39;d skim it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Microsoft has apparently decided that it has enough server capacity and has made the code available for the Windows 7 beta.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Windows 7 Beta is now available for download,&#8221; Microsoft said on its Web site. &#8220;Thanks for your interest and help with the beta.&#8221;</p>
<p>The software was supposed to be made available on Friday, but the company delayed the release after a day filled with Web site problems. </p></blockquote>
<p>The real gem though that made me laugh out loud so hard that I might have broken a few <em>windows</em> was this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Furthermore, the company cautioned that the beta is not the quality one should expect from a final release. &#8220;It can be glitchy&#8211;so don’t use a PC you need every day.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Please, please… say no more, I&#39;m wetting myself here! :-D</p>
<p>To be serious for a second though, I really do home Microsoft picks up the ball they dropped with XP and Vista. They won&#39;t of course, but for all the people in the corporate world who are stuck with Microsoft&#39;s subpar products (including my dad who I can hear swearing in the distance) I hope they at least make a sincere effort. Excuse me, I have to go laugh again!</p>
