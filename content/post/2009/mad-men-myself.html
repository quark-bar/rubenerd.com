<p>I&#39;ve fallen victim to many avatar related crazes, but this could easily be the best one I&#39;ve ever wasted a solid half and hour on. If you go to <a href="http://MadMenYourself.com">MadMenYourself.com</a>, you can make yourself into a Mad Men style character with all the great 1960s graphics! When you&#39;re done, you&#39;re given three different sized images for various social networks and a spiffy desktop background. I like my blue suit and coffee cup :).</p>
<p>It&#39;s a great advertising campaign, it shows people don&#39;t mind advertisements if companies actually take the initiative to try something new and engage with their audience &#8212; though some people apparently <a href="//rubenerd.com/holden-mediocrity/#comments">aren&#39;t a fan</a> of such thinking ;-).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never watched Mad Men before, but if appears locally I&#39;ll check it out. According to The Wikipedias it does play on SBS.</p>
