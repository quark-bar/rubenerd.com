<p>Don&#39;t look now, but according to the Official Rubenerd Blog Counter depicted in the header of this Official Rubenerd Blog, this is post number 1666. If we afford ourselves a favourite trick of the Nostradameans (the fans of the &quot;bad poet with a paranoid streak&quot; as Penn Jillette put it) we can derive meaning from this figure by dropping the &quot;1&quot; therefore leaving ourselves with the number 666. Scary stuff! Now if only I can remember why this number is scary. Is it because there was 666 Rascals? Is it because it&#39;s a triangular number? Probably some myth thing right?</p>
<p>The last time this number appeared here was in early 2008 when we all witnessed the publishing of <a href="http://rubenerd.com/666/">blog post number 666</a>. Funny how these kinds of things come around full circle isn&#39;t it? I don&#39;t get it.</p>
