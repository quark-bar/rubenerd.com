<p>I just noticed that despite WordPress assigning this post the ID of 3892, this is in fact Rubenerd Blog post number 1221. This is a ground-breaking milestone given the number 1221 is a palindromic number, meaning of course <strong>it can be read the same way backwards</strong>. The next time this will happen here will be post 1881. Seriously, try and find an earlier number that’s palindromic… it just can’t be done.</p>

<blockquote><p>One thousand, two hundred and twenty one</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we were to spell this backwards, it would be this:</p>
<blockquote><p>eno ytnewt dna derdnuh owt, dnasuoht enO</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, this number comes out exactly the same when read backwards. Aren’t palindromic numbers amazing?!</p>
<p>I just noticed that lightbulb icon isn’t turned on.</p>
