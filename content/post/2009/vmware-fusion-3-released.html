<p>For all of you operating system enthusiasts, <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">VMware Fusion 3.0</a> was just released for the Mac.</p>
<p>I bought a licence for Fusion 1.0 as soon as it came out in 2007 (<a href="//rubenerd.com/just-bought-vmware-fusion/" style="font-style:italic">Just bought VMWare Fusion</a>) because at the time I was testing various different flavours of BSD and the later builds of Parallels Desktop weren&#39;t playing nicely with them. By contrast, despite being heavily advertised as a way to run Windows, Fusion also had additions for Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris.</p>
<p>Given I got Fusion 2.0 as a free upgrade, being told I&#39;d have to shell out AU$49.00 for 3.0 was a bit of a kick in the stomach, but if after using the trial for 30 days the performance is noticeably better I&#39;ll upgrade.</p>
