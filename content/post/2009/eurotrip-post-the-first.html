<p>My dad, sis and I are just about to leave the door to start our Europe trip. We&#39;ll be heading to Germany via Dubai to catch up with relatives in Frankfurt am Main and friends in Munich, then to Plze≈à in the Czech Republic, then driving back through Germany to Paris, then a flight to Cork and a tour of Ireland.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to take a ton of photos and will be blogging as much about it as I can! In the meantime you can follow our adventures <a href="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd/">on Twitter</a> and <a href="http://gowalla.com/users/Rubenerd">Gowalla</a> too.</p>
<p>Selamat tinggal! Wait, wrong language :D</p>
