<p>Comment I just overheard someone make in class:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don’t trust Microsoft with their Azure or anything else for backing up your cloud data. They’ll Sidekick it!</p></blockquote>
<p>Sidekicking actually makes for a really a good verb! Perhaps it could be extended to refer to any cloud data loss that hasn&#39;t been adequately backed up, or data lost on services people have developed an ill advised over-dependency on. Or false advertising and breach of contract regarding data integrity and security.</p>
