<p>I’ve never been asked to write the lyrics to a song, nor have I been asked to rewrite the lyrics for existing songs by anybody. Given my changed lyrics for this Beach Boys song where I point out a mistake in their logic, I can understand why.</p>
<blockquote><p>If everybody had an ocean<br />
Across the USA</p>
<p>The whole country would sink<br />
Into a giant bay</p>
<p>All the lines I’ve replaced<br />
Have had the syllables wrong</p>
<p>A bushy bushy blond hairdo<br />
Surfin USA
</p>
</blockquote>
