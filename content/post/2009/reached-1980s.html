<p>I admit I&#39;m biased because I was born in 1986, and I also admit I was too young to remember anything of substance during the time, but it&#39;s an undisputed fact the 1980s was the greatest decade of all time! Well, politics aside of course. Yeah Thatcher and Reagan, deregulating the financial markets really worked out well, you did us a solid!</p>
<p>So in the spirit of my 1960s post <a href="//rubenerd.com/reached-1960s/">when I reached 1960 posts</a>, now that I&#39;ve reached the 1980s in my blog post count I&#39;m celebrating by creating this <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone">pointless milestone</a> post.</p>
<p>1980s for the win!</p>
