<p>Monnie over at Vanilla Silence recently wrote a detailed <a href="http://vanillasilence.com/?p=114">blog post</a> about her holidays that were otherwise fabulous save for a nasty bout of hayfever, so I decided I should talk about my flu thingy too.</p>
<p>COUGH! SNEEZE! SO HOT! SPLUTTER! COUGH! SO COLD! SNEEZE! BIRD! SNEEZE! WORD!</p>
<p>I was going somewhere with this!</p>
<p>After postponing going to the doctor for several days because doctors scare the heck out of me, I finally went this morning. Turns out what I thought was just hayfever or a common cold was the flu and a respiratory infection. I&#39;ve got stuff to take for it now and I&#39;m breathing easier already, though I still have to take it easier over the next few days. When I have assignments due and a family crisis, of course!</p>
<p>My mum put up with these symptoms when she was having cancer treatment for <strong>over 12 years</strong>. <strong>12 F*CKING YEARS</strong>. Even now I still don&#39;t know how she did it.</p>
