<p>You can also <a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewVrlNl3MyA&#038;feature=related">view this directly on YouTube</a> if you prefer.</p>

<p>I remember watching Duck Amock before I even started primary school and I thought it was hilarious! My edge-uma-cation may have changed since then, but I still consider this the greatest cartoon of all time. <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8thxWgFSVPs">Robin Hood Daffy</a> would definitely be number two, even though none of them contain Bill Kurtis.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2019</strong>: The <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewVrlNl3MyA">original video</a> is, perhaps unsurprisingly, no longer available. I've deleted the HTML object.</p>
