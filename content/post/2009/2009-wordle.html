<p>I thought it was particularly trippy that this is the 2009th post, and the year is 2009. Just think about that for a second: from now on the number of posts will exceed the year. It&#39;ll be as if I&#39;ll be blogging from the future. If that isn&#39;t trippy, quite frankly I don&#39;t want to know what is.</p>
<p>To celebrate, I put the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009/">2009 year page on Wikipedia</a> through <a href="http://wordle.net/">Wordle</a> and got the above thing. Interesting if cryptic mix of words.</p>
