<p>For my American friends, from Wired.com&#39;s report on <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/07/black-hole-gadgets/">gadgets they wish hadn&#39;t been invented</a>. Surprising though it may seem, as with the friends I&#39;m addressing this post to, Wired also happens to be American.</p>
<p>Whatever the shrink is giving me, it&#39;s either too powerful, or not powerful enough. Grilled cheese sandwiches are best when they&#39;re made from bread and cheese. You read it here fist. First, you read it here first. Heaven forbid I be caught out making a typoo.</p>
