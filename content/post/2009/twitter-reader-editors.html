<p>It&#39;s killing me that I don&#39;t remember where I heard this, but someone made the comment that many of us online are almost welcoming the demise of newspapers because we think they&#39;re outdated dinosaurs, yet at the same time we complain about being overwhelmed by all the content streaming in from web feeds we subscribe to!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>While web feeds in <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/09454950261221562208">Google Reader</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd/">Twitter</a> give us many of the same stories a newspaper would have shown us on the following day, one thing they haven&#39;t replicated is the newspaper or magazine <strong>editor</strong>. We&#39;ve become our own editors for stories we want to see which gives us unlimited power, but then the burden is on us to filter through thousands of new stories a day to find what&#39;s interesting and reliable.</p>
<p>The ironic thing is I&#39;ve toyed with the idea of giving up on services like Google Reader entirely because frankly I just don&#39;t have the time to sit down and skim thousands of stories each day let alone read them all, and if you don&#39;t it shows you that nonsensical <a href="http://rubenerd.com/agitating-google-reader-users/">unread items counter</a>. Even Dave Winer has repeatedly made the observation that we don&#39;t get a counter on a newspaper or magazine letting us know how many stories we haven&#39;t read, because such a number is meaningless and doesn&#39;t reflect how we read them.</p>

<p>This is where I think Twitter has had a profound impact on me beyond just reading what someone ate for breakfast (the stereotypical use that keeps getting used for some reason). I follow a few hundred friends on Twitter who comment and link to stories which I then read, and I comment on stories and link to them. In a way I&#39;ve chosen a few hundred <strong>editors</strong> who have similar tastes and views (and sometimes beneficially wildly different) as me. In this way, the burden of filtering through all the billions of news stories and blog posts a day is distributed over far more people, and I actually end up reading more as a result. Google Reader has a shared items feature, and sites like Digg let you rate stories, but just as a newspaper feels slow compared to Google Reader and Digg, neither Google Reader nor Digg have the immediacy that Twitter has.</p>
<p>I have no doubt none of us will be using Twitter in several years, we would have moved onto the next collaborative microblog platform or whatever it is (<a href="http://identi.ca/">Identi.ca</a> perhaps?), but when you start seeing newspapers and TV shows quoting Twitter you know it&#39;s really changing something.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m off to post a comment on Twitter about an Israeli settlement that&#39;s causing problems (no, really?), our PM&#39;s latest trip and what type of coffee I&#39;m <a href="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd/status/4383762375">having at the Boatdeck Cafe</a>. It&#39;s not what I ate for breakfast, but it&#39;s what I&#39;m drinking. Hope nobody minds ^_^.</p>
