<p>It&#39;s official ladies and gents, the <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">Rubenerd Show</a> and <a href="//rubenerd.com/">Rubenerd Blog</a> are no longer being blocked by The Cathay wireless system and Starhub Internet in Singapore for hosting malware. I appealed the filtering and stated that my shared webserver was the victim of a very brief internal lax group permission enforcement code injection attack and that I had swiftly cleaned my sites of the spam malware links.</p>
<p>I received a message back this evening stating that my appeal had been successful and I&#39;m now typing this blog post <strong><em>without</em></strong> using a proxy server! Hallelujah! I suspect my traffic from Singapore may start crawling back to the highs it had in December last year again.</p>
<p>This by no means has deterred me from moving to a new web host though; I&#39;m already in the process of moving archived Rubenerd Show files over to the Internet Archive (you can  <a href="http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22ruben%20schade%22">track my progress here</a>) and am in the process of upgrading my <a href="http://segpub.com.au/">Segment Publishing</a> account so I can host this blog, my podcast, my pontifications and my anime blog on there instead of just my lightly used university blog whatsit. It&#39;s going to be a massive, all in one site with everything, I&#39;m looking forward to it!</p>
<p>But being serious again for a second though, this whole experience has taught me a valuable lesson: the ramifications of hosting your media on a budget web host that doesn&#39;t enforce sufficient internal security (<em>even more important than external security</em>) is not worth any financial savings you may glean, no matter how significant. Thousands of gigabytes of capacity and transfer per month for less than $10 may sound like a better deal than a few gigabytes of capacity and transfer a month for a similar price, but as they always say: <em>&quot;if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re interested in these exploits, a quick search for <em>&quot;Servage Hacked&quot;</em> on <a href="http://www.google.com.sg/search?q=servage+hacked">Google</a> or <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=servage+hacked">Yahoo</a> will tell you all about it and give you an idea of the extent of the damage and fallout from their lax approach to security. Scary stuff.</p>
<p>In any event, I&#39;m off to brew myself a cup of green tea in celebration :)</p>
