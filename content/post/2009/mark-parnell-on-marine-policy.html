<p>For those who don&#39;t use Twitter and who aren&#39;t following South Australian Legislative Council Greens member <a href="http://twitter.com/MarkParnellMLC">Mark Parnell</a>, he had <a href="http://twitter.com/MarkParnellMLC/status/3856105955">this to say</a> earlier this afternoon:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/MarkParnellMLC/status/3856105955"><p>Marine Policy 101: Kill seagrass with pollution = mobilised sand = eroded beaches = $$$ to pump more sand on shore to keep our beaches nice!</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s funny (in a kind of tragic way) because it&#39;s true. Welcome to the world of reactionary rather than preventative environmental politics, or as I see it, fixing the symptoms not the causes. It works so well for health, education and transport, might as well put it into practise for the environment too.</p>
