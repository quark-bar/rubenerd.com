<p>I&#39;ve started using <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> more on my Macs for editing code because It Just Works&trade; and has some really useful features. It just has one nagging little problem to do with files; every single time I create a file outside a project and go to save it, the Save As dialog box ignores where other open files are located and defaults to the root of my primary hard drive to save the file. Every. Single. Time!</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to have to create projects for each set of files that I&#39;m working on once and forgetting about, is there any way to modify this default behavior? Even having it default to my home directory would be a start.</p>
