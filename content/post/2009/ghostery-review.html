<p>One of the extensions I added to my <a href="//rubenerd.com/firefox-extensions/">recent Mozilla Firefox extensions post</a> that I hadn&#39;t talked about before is a privacy gem called <a href="http://www.ghostery.com/">Ghostery</a>. Whenever you visit a website that has hidden web bugs (bugs as in spying not errors) to track your online behaviour, it briefly superimposes a translucent message in the top right corner of the window informing you of such. It also adds a cute little Pacman-like monster to your status bar that persistently identifies how many bugs are on the current page.</p>
<p>As was the case when I realised how many sites break when JavaScript is only selectively enabled with <a href="http://noscript.net/">NoScript</a> and when cookies are only selectively enabled with <a href="http://gorgias.de/mfe/">PermitCookies</a>, it&#39;s been a real eye opener to see just how much snooping is happening on various sites I visit with this extension installed.</p>
<p>Some sites have nothing, others are perfectly harmless such as <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/">Whole Wheat Radio</a> which only employs Google Analytics:</p>

<p>The current record for the most number of bugs on pages I frequent since installing this extension is <a href="http://mashable.com/">Mashable</a> which ranged from six to eight depending on the page. They look innocuous enough to me, but the number does seem a bit excessive:</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.ghostery.mashable.png" alt="Ghostery on Mashable" style="height:190px; width:500px; display:inline; border:0px; margin-right:1em;" /></p>
<p>As with much of security, the number of bugs on pages isn&#39;t necessarily an automatic indication of how trustworthy a site is, though I would propose it does indicate where the priorities of the web developer and/or the site owners are. What&#39;s more important to notice is what the bugs <em>are</em>.</p>
<p>My browsing habits haven&#39;t really changed since installing Ghostery, but as with all my other security and privacy extensions it&#39;s a part of my web defence kit which helps me identify material on sites so I can make informed decisions.</p>
