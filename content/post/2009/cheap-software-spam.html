<p>Today&#39;s spam message which I picked up while combing through the spam folders for false positives is one which advertises a cheap source of computer software:</p>
<blockquote><p>

The fact they only made a few spelling mistakes on this message impressed me though!</p>
<p>Anyway onto their claim: I already know several &quot;cheaper source[s]&quot; for original, high quality and perfectly working computer software, and I reckon they&#39;re even cheaper still! the <a href="http://freshports.org/">FreeBSD Ports System</a>, <a href="http://pkgsrc.se">NetBSD&#39;s pkgsrc</a>, <a href="http://aur.archlinux.org/">Arch Linux&#39;s AUR</a>, <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Apt">Debian apt-get</a>, Mac OS X and Darwin&#39;s <a href="http://macports.org/">MacPorts</a> and <a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a>â€¦</p>
<p>Couldn&#39;t help it, why just talk about spam when you can squeeze in some advocacy too while you&#39;re at it?</p>
