<p>I was sitting at the Boatdeck Cafe this morning thinking of all the work I was supposed to be doing, and it was so overwhelming I decided to write a nonsensical Java application to tell us The Tale of Alan A&#39;Dale instead.</p>
<p>Feel free to paste the code into your favourite text editor then execute it on your machine if you wish to feel the wondrousness. That is a word isn&#39;t it?</p>
