<p>
<blockquote>To whomever Gibsons and Laportes this may concern,</p>
<p>I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis.</p>
<p>I thought I&#39;d just throw a message over to you guys to clarify one point that was raised on Security Now Episode 181 &quot;Crypto Rehash&quot;.</p>
<p>Steve, you commented that you failed to see the point of putting MD5 or SHA hashes on websites that offered downloads given that if a website was compromised the hash could easily be changed as well. I must admit I had never thought of it that way myself either; I had a hearty chuckle on the train along with you guys much to the bewilderment of my fellow commuters!</p>
<p>I would comment though that I was under the impression that hashes under download links are not provided for the purposes of verifying a file hasn&#39;t been tampered with for security reasons, but was instead provided so you could verify that the downloaded file had been received intact. As a FreeBSD user I download ISO images and regularly use the hashes to verify that the finished download wasn&#39;t corrupted while downloading before I burn a coaster with one. Not sure if this is really necessary, but it has alerted me to a couple of failed downloads in the past.</p>
<p>Thanks for the great show and all the effort and preparation you put into each one.</p>
<p>Most humbly and securely yours,<br />
