<p>In the movie <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/About_a_Boy_%28film%29">About a Boy</a> (I didn&#39;t ever read the book), Hugh Grant&#39;s character had a system whereby he&#39;d split up his day into half hour units. A haircut would be two units. Having lunch would be another unit. Throwing grilled cheese sandwiches at kids who walk up his door would be three units.</p>
<p>I&#39;m fortunate that despite having mountains of stuff to do every day, I generally have at least a few units I can dedicate to doing frivolous things like watching anime, blogging about nonsense and taking walks around the park while listening to Miles Davis and Michael Franks.</p>
<p>I belabour all this nonsense (even more than usual) because for the first time in over two months I had someâ€¦ <strong><em>concurrent</em></strong> units! I instantly set about redesigning my site again, I&#39;ve never been pleased with my designs and this latest one solves many of the problems with the current one. I&#39;ve also tweaked my latest software redesign so I can finally get off WordPress once and for all.</p>
<p>Knowing me, neither will get implemented. Fun to think about alternative possibilities though. And as for the coffee? I put it on it&#39;s side to imply greater impact. How does a coffee on its side imply greater impact? I have no friggen idea, but it sounded good in my head.</p>
