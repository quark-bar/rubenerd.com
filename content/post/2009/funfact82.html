<p><span style="font-weight:bold">A special edition of <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/fun-facts/">Fun Facts</a> here today folks!</span> If you never took notes on any of the previous ones, you&#39;ll want to for this one.</p>
<p>So I was trying to find out the best way to rent out my Spanish holiday home for the 365 days of the year where I&#39;m not living in it, and I came across the <a href="http://www.qsdgroup.co.uk/servicio-alquileres.asp">QSD Group in the United Kingdom</a>. According to their site description:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some of our clients rent out their property on the coast during their absence. This could be a way to increase the return on your investment or to pay off part of your mortgage. There are plenty of companies and internet portals that offer you their rental services. QSD Group recommends the services of OPI Rentals, specialists in management and rentals.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right, they think their primary description is so important they insist on relaying it twice. I&#39;d never be caught making such an obvious mistake on my blog here, the one where they think their primary description is so important they insist on relaying it twice.</p>
<h3>Where is the Fun Fact in all this Ruben?!</h3>
<p>Okay, I&#39;m getting to that. It has to do with their pictured customer service representative on their website&#39;s header:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Fun Fact #82</strong>: You get more clients when the customer service representative pictured on your website doesn’t look so bored he’s about to kill you.</p></blockquote>
