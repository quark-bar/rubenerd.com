<p>Working on a site design this afternoon I got a kick out of this CSS statement I had just written; it seems that my designs and programming are affected by my political compass! See if you can get it.</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>#heading {
  background: #009900 url("heading.png") center left no-repeat;
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess if I wanted to make it more specific I could change some of the variables around:</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>#compass {
  background: url("libertarian.png") center left;
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This kind of reminds me of Perl Golf and Ruby Poetry. Good times.</p>
