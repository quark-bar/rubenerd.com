<p>I know I <a href="//rubenerd.com/anime-mio-moeblob/">only just posted</a> about Akiyama Mio from K-On but this picture was too good. In hindsight I should have put this picture on that aformentioned blog post instead of the one I ended up with, but oh well.</p>
<p>Anyway here we have Mio on a Ducati no less! I wonder if she&#39;s met Casey Stoner?</p>
<p>I&#39;ll get my motorcycle licence one of these days, it&#39;s on my laundry list length to do list (try saying that quickly five times in a row!). Once I do I&#39;ll get a fuel efficient Piaggio scooter for quick trips and a small, bright yellow Ducati for longer ones. I know I&#39;m supposed to get a red one, but I saw a couple of yellow ones in Singapore and they were pretty damn swish. This is of course after I&#39;ve won the lottery and stopped <a href="//rubenerd.com/thinkpad-x40/">wasting money on computers</a>.</p>
