<p>For those of you playing at home, this is the 2400th post published on this here blog. Actually that&#39;s a blatant lie, it was the <a href="//rubenerd.com/the-unarchiver-2-2/">previous one</a>. It shows how spiffy I must have thought The Unarchiver was that I completely missed the fact it was the 24(*10^2) blog post. Spiffyness.</p>
<h3>Update!</h3>
<p>It seems I got that <strong>completely wrong</strong>, given the count is actually 2403 now. Please disragard this entire post. I need a cup of coffee.</p>
