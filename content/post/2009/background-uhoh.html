<p>If you thought weirdness with regards to this blog was limited to my obsession with grilled cheese sandwiches and the mentioning of Fun Facts which you don&#39;t think are terribly fun given your rather stern nature and lack of patience for nonsensical silliness, here&#39;s something weird that for once isn&#39;t the direct result of my brain.</p>
<p>In the screenshot above can you make out the single pixel line that&#39;s been shifted in this particular part of the screen? This is the second time in as many days that my desktop background has been distorted exactly like this.</p>
<p>Back in 1997 my first desktop started exhibiting similar behaviour and we predicted the graphics card was on it&#39;s way out. Several weeks later we were proved right. Here&#39;s hoping this is just a random software glitch, yeesh!</p>
