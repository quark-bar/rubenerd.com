<p>So I&#39;ve come down with such a severe case of hayfever now that Spring has finally Sprung that I think I was making more noise this morning than the constructon workers across the street. Every time I sneezed in the loungeroom I think I broke a window, quite an achievement when you consider our small house here only has glass doors and no windows.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>With this in mind, I figured I needed to write another one of my rambling nonsensical blog posts that not only don&#39;t have any point but are so utterly meaningless Rupert Murdoch wants to publish it in an Aussie newspaper and charge people online to see it.</p>
<p>The question is, what should I discuss here, or should I be discussing anything here at all considering I have homework and work to do, not to mention the fact I have over fifty (yes!) draft posts that haven&#39;t been finished yet. I mean, one glance at the quality of this blog and you could be forgiven for thinking those draft posts must be pretty awful if they don&#39;t even reach the minumum bar set so low here that I tripped over it while running to the tissue box. What?</p>
<p>Speaking of boxes, my spam inbox this morning had <code>486</code> messages in it, all it would need would be for my primary inbox to have <code>80486</code> messages in it for it to be even more 90s retro. At the rate of pileup I don&#39;t think I&#39;m that far off that!</p>
<p>Is it called Southeast Asia or South East Asia or South-East Asia? And what&#39;s the point of ASEAN, has it achieved anything at all?</p>
<p>And finally, as I was walking to the Boatdeck Cafe this morning to have a cup of coffee and sit in a comfy chair to help make myself feel better, I trumpeted a sneeze so loudly a dog someone was walking started barking.</p>
