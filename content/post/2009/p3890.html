<blockquote><p>Well pardon me sir, but what if what if I wished to partake of said microwave by attempting to cook metallic objects?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He didn’t say that, but I saw this scene and the sign and just had to take a terrible screenshot along with an accompanying fabricated quote. Along with, and accompanying… together. And at the same time. Together and at the same time. Both.</p>
<p>I don’t watch much television (ridiculous anime, <a href="http://crankygeeks.com/">Cranky Geeks</a> and The Simpsons aside of course!), but Boston Legal is one show I really enjoyed watching. Fantastic writing, and a huge shame it ended so abruptly.</p>

<p>This fabricated quote that didn’t actually happen also reminds me of these particular lines from John Lennon’s <em>Nobody Told Me (There’s Be Days Like These)</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
There’s always somethin’ cookin’<br />
But nothin’s in the pot
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well there you go, it seems John Lennon was unaware that the food wasn’t in a pot but rather in a microwave at Crane, Poole and Schmidt. Or perhaps he knew somehow in advance that somebody had placed a metallic object in the aformentioned microwave therefore rendering it incapable of cooking food given a resulting explosion.</p>
<p>Lennon had said he and the Beatles were bigger than Jesus… perhaps we should have taken this admission more literally.</p>
<p>So there you have it. On a related note, what did you do on <strong><em>your</em></strong> Saturday night? Were you witty and were you able to connect two seemingly unrelated quotes from two different mediums, one quote of which you blatantly fabricated having seen a backdrop in a scene?</p>
<p>I think I’ll stop now.</p>
