<p>Given Last.fm&#39;s probably necessary but <a href="//rubenerd.com/p3945/">poorly executed recent move</a> to charge people living outside select countries, Ruben relegated it to the roll of just <a href="http://last.fm/user/rubenerd/">keeping track of music he&#39;s played</a> via it&#39;s scrobbling client in order to generate his own music charts.</p>
<p>He wondered where they got the word <em>scrobble</em> from in the first place. He thought it sounded like a budget brand of oat cereal. You know, the one with &quot;clusters&quot; or &quot;pieces&quot; or &quot;sultanas&quot; or whatever it is the blasted granola lobby calls them these days. <em>Scrobble</em> is a part of a nutritious breakfast, along with <em>Eggo</em> and <em>Pop Tarts</em>. Yeesh.</p>
<p>Upon updating his profile to reflect this narrowing of use of his Last.fm account, he noticed his sister had a graphic displaying her most played artist along with a percentage breakdown of said artist and her two runner-ups. He also noticed he started referring to himself in the third person for some reason beyond him.</p>
<p>Ruben decided the graphic his sister had looked just smashing, so he proceeded to direct his browser to <a href="http://lastfm.bintrash.org/">BloGate&#39;s last.fm sidebar image generator</a> to create one for himself. He entered his username and was presented with the graphic you see to the right of this text.</p>
<p>He was surprised that the living jazz legend <a href="http://michaelfranks.com/">Michael Franks</a> was played a stupendously ridiculous (he liked the phrasing of that) 10% of the time. He knew <a href="//rubenerd.com/michaelfranks/">he was obsessed with his music</a>, but certainly not to that extent. End of communique.</p>
