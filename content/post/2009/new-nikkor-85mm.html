<p>If I were to classify myself on an arbitrary scale of photographic skill, I&#39;d be positioned at the part where &quot;he use manual settings on his DSLR for fun but would probably get better results most of the time if he used automatic!&quot; Well okay I admit most of the time I use aperture priority mode on my Nikon D60 which is cheating a little ;-).</p>
<p>A sign of the times though is the fact that I&#39;m starting to get less excited about new computer gadgets as I do when I find out Nikon/Nikkor has a new lens coming out. Paroozing the Nikon website I confirmed what the <a href="http://www.bjp-online.com/public/showPage.html?page=870043">British Journal of Photography</a> said, they&#39;re releasing a <a href="http://imaging.nikon.com/products/imaging/lineup/lens/af/dx/af-s_dx_micro85mmf_35g_ed_vr/index.htm">new 85mm prime DX lens</a>!</p>
<p>Despite only being able to manually focus on my Nikon D60, my favourite lens is still my AF 50mm f/1.8. Aside from when I want to take nature shots from afar with my 55-200mm, prime lenses offer sharpness and speed that us amateurs can take advantage of despite our limited skill :).</p>
<p>Unfortunately the price will probably be far too high for someone like me (about Â£500!!!) but I&#39;ll be keeping my eye out.</p>
