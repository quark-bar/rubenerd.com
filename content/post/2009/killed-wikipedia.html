<p>Out of interest, the article I was trying to access was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_ensign">government ensign</a>. I was trying to win a bet; the guy I was talking to was adamant that a <strong>government ensign</strong> was a flavour of sorbet. I worry about him sometimes.</p>
