<p>The amazing power of Twitter. In the last hour my very close friend Felix Tanjono <a href="http://twitter.com/redragon/status/3707633865">reported that he was feeling severe tremors</a> in his house in Jakarta. Within minutes the main trending topic on Twitter was &quot;<a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=Earthquake+OR+%23earthquake">earthquake</a>&quot;, and after a short time Australia&#39;s <a href="http://twitter.com/abcnews/">ABC News</a> started <a href="http://twitter.com/abcnews/status/3707714058">reporting the quake</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/abcnews/status/3707714058"><p>Indonesiaâ€™s seismology agency says it has recorded a powerful 7.3 earthquake near the main island of Java</p></blockquote>
<p>What&#39;s farcical is half an hour later on their flagship 6pm bulletins neither <a href="http://au.news.yahoo.com/">Channel 7</a> or <a href="http://news.ninemsn.com.au/">Channel 9</a> here in Adelaide had a story on the quake, not even a &quot;breaking news&quot; update or mention whatsoever. Some of the stories they felt were more important? A human interest story on an American family that now has over a dozen children. The rides for the Royal Adelaide Show. An <strong>entire day&#39;s worth of sporting news</strong>. All this half an hour after the Australian ABC had managed to report it.</p>
<p>I know I&#39;m used to getting my news near instantly with Twitter now and my expectations are much higher, but this is still pretty bad. A 7+ quake is huge.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Channel 7 briefly reported the quake with a one line report at 18:28, over 45 minutes after the ABC.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/news/">SBS World News</a> is <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/1082077/Strong-quake-strikes-off-Indonesian-coast">reporting</a> the quake now. Their television news bulletin just started, at 18:30.</p></blockquote>
