<p>I usually don&#39;t read the Singapore Straits Times, but Stephanie Yeow&#39;s graphic in <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_465706.html">their story</a> about drink driving was just too well done to pass up.</p>
<p>I wish the Singapore Police luck in their efforts to curb drink driving with <strong>incentives</strong> instead of nagging which I&#39;ve maintained never works because it attacks the symptoms and not the societal causes. For example, both Singapore and Australia have had countless anti-drink driving campaigns pitched through all forms of media and as far as I know they haven&#39;t done anything.</p>
<p>Then there are 23 year old people like me who don&#39;t even have a car licence and probably have one or two standard drinks a month, if that. Go figure.</p>
