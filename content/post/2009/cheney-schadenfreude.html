<p>It&#39;s hard for me to believe it&#39;s been over three years and six months since Dick Cheney shot his hunting buddy in the face. I can still remember <a href="//rubenerd.com/81/">blogging about</a> and watching David Letterman late at night (really?) on Channel 9 the day after it happened and wanting my own <a href="//rubenerd.com/dick-cheney-shirt/">I&#39;ve Not Been Shot by Dick Cheney</a> shirt.</p>
<p>Anyone else relieved beyond all doubt this guy isn&#39;t number 2 in the world any more? Well he may still be in a low brow metaphorical sense.</p>
<p>Jon Stewart needs to do more <strong>You Don&#39;t Know Dick</strong>, and Letterman needs to do more <strong>How&#39;d He Do?</strong> segments even if only to satisfy my need in this case for schadenfruede!</p>
