<p>As I&#39;ve eluded to previously I <a href="//rubenerd.com/stability-firefox35/">gave up on Firefox 3.5.x</a> on my MacBook Pro OS X and FreeBSD partitions because it was far too unstable to use without going bat crazy insane. I left Windows for a reason!</p>
<p>For some reason though going back to 3.0.x has caused <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> to generate a few errors a day after not having any trouble at all. It could very well be a problem with our home internet connection here not Firefox but it is a weird coincidence.</p>
<p>If it weren&#39;t for the fact all my friends from Twitter, Whole Wheat Radio and the real world used it I&#39;d probably go back to <a href="http://beta.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> full time. In fact at one point I was going to research whether I could subscribe to people&#39;s Google shared items and comments in Bloglines and have people subscribe to my Bloglines shared items and comments from Google Reader. Might be worth looking into again.</p>
