<p>Typing up the last post about how copyright infringement isn&#39;t stealing, I entered the word &quot;movies&quot; and was told by the spell checker it wasn&#39;t even a word.</p>

Back in my day we didn&#39;t have no stinkin&#39; movies, all we had to entertain us were still JPEGs we had to craft from raw hexadecimal code in text editors! Because it took so long we would entertain ourselves with spell checkers, which in those days were called spelling verification modules. They cost $9 million dollars for a licence, which in those days you had to order over the phone and have delivered to you on stacks of punch cards. And you felt damned good for the privileged gosh darn it! You kids today with your weird motion pictures and obscure word concatenations!<br />
