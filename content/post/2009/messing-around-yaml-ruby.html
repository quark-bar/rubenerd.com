<p>Having studied Java almost exclusively at uni for a while, I decided while I had a holiday break I&#39;d mess around with some <a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> goodness. Today was all about messing with YAML for a potential project thingy, to use technical terms.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>To get started, the spiffy (though unfortunately named) dump method lets us see how a simple Ruby hash would look in YAML:</p>
<pre>#!/opt/local/bin/ruby1.9 -w
require "yaml"
tsundere = {
  'Bakemonogatari' => 'Senjoughara Hitagi',
  'Clannad' => 'Fujibayashi Kyou'
}
puts YAML.dump(tsundere)

==>---
Clannad: Fujibayashi Kyou
Bakemonogatari: Senjoughara Hitagi
</pre>
<p>Seems simple enough. What if we created a hash of hashes and exported that? Would we get some nesting going on that makes semantic sense?</p>
<pre>moeness = {
  'SOSDan' => 'Asahina Mikuru',
  'K-On!' => 'Akiyama Mio'
}
animegirls = {
  'Tsundere' => tsundere,
  'moeness' => moeness
}
puts YAML.dump(animegirls)

==>---
Tsundere:
  Clannad: Fujibayashi Kyou
  Bakemonogatari: Senjoughara Hitagi
moeness:
  K-On!: Akiyama Mio
  SOSDan: Asahina Mikuru
</pre>
<p>Shiny :). I suppose the next step is taking an existing YAML file and import it back. I imagine some nested blocks would be in order, no?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve written some basic YAML flat file databases for myself before, but not with Ruby in mind. I&#39;ve been told its excellent for object serialisation that&#39;s still human readable, but I&#39;m more interested in being able to read/write preformatted data.</p>
<p>Where are you __why, we need your awesomeness back.</p>
