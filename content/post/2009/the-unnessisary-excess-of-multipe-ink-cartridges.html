<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/photo.canonprinterwaste.jpg" alt="Multiple ink cartriges are such a waste!" style="height:334px; width:500px; display:inline; border:0px;" /><br /><cite>Replacement ink cartridge mess from this evening</cite></p>
<p>Ever since I was a tiny little person I&#39;ve always found photos of environmental destruction and human excess to be disturbing. This evening I had a quick first hand experience with both.</p>
<p>The Canon Pixma Pro9000 is a remarkable printer; the photos my father takes with his Nikon D90 and the ones I take with my Nikon D60 come out looking absolutely stunning. To my untrained eye the quality matches that you would get at a professional photo developing shop. It has borderless printing options, it can print up to A3 in size, it&#39;s surprisingly quick even at high resolution settings and the drivers are a breath of fresh air, even if the driver CD also attempts to intstal a lot of other unnecessary cruft unless you tell it not to.</p>
<p>One of the features this Pro9000 shares with other higher end photo printers is it&#39;s individual tanks for each colour, in this case there are nine. The logic behind this is that if one colour is exhausted, you don&#39;t have to resort to throwing away a whole cartridge which may have plenty of other coloured inks still available. I called B.S. on this the instant I saw it; if a printer company really cared about saving us money they wouldn&#39;t price the ink at levels which beat precious metals in weight, and they would let us… shock horror… refill the cartridges! What is the point of throwing away a perfectly usable storage tank like a cartridge?</p>
<p>But this isn&#39;t the worst of it. As you can see in the image above, this evening I replaced three of the cartridges out of the nine: and look at the amount of waste! To get to the cartridge you need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an oversized cardboard box that could easily be half the size</li>
<li>Open a thick, non-recyclable plastic bag that also could easily be half the size</li>
<li>Open another shrink-wrapped piece of plastic</li>
<li>Turn and pop off another thick plastic tab with a huge handle to expose the tiny ink outlet</li>
</ol>
<p>Why does Canon need to do this? I am always impressed with the quality and build of Canon products, but this amount of protection seems (at least to me) to be really wasteful and superfluous.</p>
<p>What would make sense would be a system to refill the cartridges with licenced Canon ink. I don&#39;t care if they charged as much for a refill as they currently do for a regular cartridge (let&#39;s be realistic, as if printer companies are going to give up that golden goose), the point is we&#39;re trying to reduce waste.</p>
