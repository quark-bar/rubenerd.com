<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This post should be considered hysterical… wait, sorry…. historical, because I’m fickle and decided to change it back to the Rubenerd Blog. When I saw all the names I’d have to update on all my profiles everywhere and all the people that linked to me, I dropped to the floor and hit my head on the side of the table as I did so. True story.</p>
<p>I guess at least I did get all my stuff merged here. It was painful.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is with great pride while I incessantly sneeze with spring hay fever that I announce the renaming of the <a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://rubenerd.com/">Rubenerd Blog</a> to:</p>
<h3 style="font-weight:bold"><a href="http://rubenerd.com/">Rubenérd Incorporated!</a></h3>
<p>The new name reflects the fact I was sick of the old name, that I folded so much other material from other sites of mine into this in the last few months, and that I&#39;ve merged so many friggen metadata categories and other such nonsense into simpler categories that actually make sense. I thought it was a clever pun. Oh yeah, and I always sided with Jerry Seinfeld in thinking the word &quot;blog&quot; sounds like a condition with the nasal passages. Speaking of which, I have terrible hayfever, not sure whether I told you.</p>
<p>This is riveting news, I expect I&#39;ll be getting calls from major news outlets shortly. I hear <a href="http://cnn.com/quest/">Richard Quest</a> wants to dedicate an entire Business Traveller episode to it, and Jim Kloss wants to book me for a speech at the <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/">Wheat Palace</a>. I hope they&#39;re both willing to pay for my airfares to London and Talkeetna, I&#39;ll be blowing all my savings on a new laptop given my MacBook Pro from 2006 kicked the bucket. What did the bucket ever do to deserve such treatment?</p>

<p>Clever right? Right?</p>
