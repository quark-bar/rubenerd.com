<p>Browsing a website this afternoon I saw the advertisement shown above. For those using text browsers, the banner reads <em>&quot;Hosting for people who build websites&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>In other news, Volkswagon would like to announce they make cars for people who drive, Sakai Sushi is for people who eat fish, and my blog is for people to read so that they know I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis.</p>
<p>I guess their slogan is still better than any of the banks here in Singapore or Australia ^_^.</p>
