<p>It&#39;s now 2009, and I thought I&#39;d celebrate here in my own style. Above is a <a href="http://www.wordle.net/">Wordle</a> generated from all the most commonly used words from the Rubenerd Blog for 2008. It seems 2008 was a year for Google, the MacBook, Adelaide, FreeBSD, OSs and Mac. Lesser used but also important words were Obama, Internet, Australia, Twitter and FireWire.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to believe that it&#39;s already 2009, it feels as though 2009 only just begun itself. Wait, did I just say 2009 just begun? That&#39;s funny, because it did in fact only arrive yesterday. Wait, that isn&#39;t funny, it&#39;s true.</p>
<p>Then again don&#39;t they always say that fact is stranger than fiction? This raises a series of interesting questions. If fact is stranger than fiction, does that mean truth is therefore stranger than fiction? Does this mean what&#39;s true is more interesting than what has been fabricated? I think I may be onto something here!</p>
<p>Happy new year everybody, here&#39;s hoping 2009 is better than 2008. Given the bar was set so low, I doubt this will be a problem.</p>
