rubenerd,</p>
<p>As mentioned last week, because youâ€™ve posted articles, photos or video to NowPublic <strong>[I have?]</strong>, our sister site <strong>[redacted]</strong>, is now personally inviting you to also become an Examiner <strong>for the US or Canadian city where you live</strong> &#8211; chose from 160 &#8211; or for one of the two national editions.</p>

<p>If this was an autogenerated email, it wouldn&#39;t have taken much effort for them to see that I&#39;m clearly not from either place! I suppose it&#39;s too much to ask for spam to at least be <strong>slightly</strong> relevant ;).</p>
