<p>Despite being released during the last <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age">ice age</a>, <a href="http://www.comon.dk/nyheder/Danske-medier-lover-doed-over-Internet-Explorer-6-1.138882.html">Internet Explorer 6</a> is still choking innovation and standards on the web, perhaps just as Microsoft intended. We need to get Internet Explorer 6 users off the net and onto newer browsers such as <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Mozilla Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.opera.com/browser/">Opera</a>, <a href="http://apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> or if they&#39;re okay with companies calling home then <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> might also be feasible. Heck even <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/internet-explorer/default.aspx">Internet Explorer 8</a> or Windows Internet Explorer 8 or Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer Home Premium Online Edition 2009 would be a start.</p>
<p>Fortunately there is a way to encourage users on corporate computers who aren&#39;t allowed to install or modify the software on their machine and inexperienced users who don&#39;t know how to install or modify software in the first place to move over to a different browser, and it&#39;s so breathtakingly obvious I&#39;m kicking my left shin with my left foot for not coming up with it myself.</p>
<p>By going to <a href="http://twibbon.com/">Twibbon</a> you can add an <a href="http://twibbon.com/join/IE6-Must-Die">Internet Explorer 6 must die</a> badge on your Twitter profile and let the entire world see it! I suspect once such a movement reaches critical mass even the companies <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/05/27/422721.aspx">still on Windows 2000</a> will start to take notice and upgrade.</p>
<p>Okay I admit it, I was being sarcastic (no, really?) but the truth is we do need to get Internet Explorer 6 off the net. Even if only one person changes their browser in response to seeing my Toblerone nose that happens to have an indecipherable graphic that I assume is a tiny Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer Home Premium Online Edition 2009 icon with a strike through it, then I know it was worth it.</p>
