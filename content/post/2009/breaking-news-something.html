<p>The event took place earlier this evening Earth time with as many as no, one or more than one witnesses.</p>
<p>An interviewee commented that &quot;[they] was just standing there, when suddenly it happened. [They] weren&#39;t anywhere near where it happened, but [they] know that it did. At least [they] think it did.&quot;.</p>
<p>There will be more news as this breaking story develops, most likely to do with matters that have nothing in common with this story.</p>
