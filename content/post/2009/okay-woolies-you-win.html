<p>Even before my family left Australia to move to Singapore, I remember every time we went to our nearby Coles supermarket we&#39;d be asked if we had a FlyBuys card. I think it was the same with Myer, Kmart and Target too. Good afternoon, do you have FlyBuys? Hello, do you have your FlyBuys today? Hi there, are you a FlyBuys cardholder? Do you have FlyBuys? Good morning, is that a FlyBuys card? FlyBuys? FLYBUYS?! I&#39;ll show you FlyBuys, it&#39;s right next to my STOP ASKING ME THAT card!</p>
<p>When I started studying here and living part time in Mawson Lakes I got used to walking to the Woolies down at Mawson Central, and fortunately up until last year they didn&#39;t have such a loyalty card programme, but now they do. Good afternoon, do you have an Everyday Rewards card? Hi there, got an Everyday Rewards card? ARGH!</p>
<p>Call it <strong>caving in</strong> or <strong>succumbing to pressure</strong>, but decided to give up and sign up for a <a href="https://www.everydayrewards.com.au">Woolworths Everyday Rewards</a> card. I figure when I make it to the checkout I can show them this piece of plastic which is akin to a giant sign asking them <strong>not to ask whether I have an Everyday Rewards card.</strong> It&#39;s like being a lightning fast ninja, but without all the physical exertion and mental training.</p>
<p>They&#39;ll no doubt keep track of what I purchase and use it for advertising purposes, but it&#39;s a small price to pay for my sanity. Heck, I might even get a couple of free things after I&#39;ve spent money at that same Woolworths every week for fifty years or however long it takes.</p>
<p>I think I also got a <a href="http://www.qantas.com.au/fflyer/dyn/program/welcome">Qantas Frequent Flyer</a> account too. Can I transfer them to <a href="http://www.singaporeair.com/">Singapore Airlines</a> you think? ;).</p>
