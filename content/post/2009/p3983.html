<p>This post is partly derived from a list on my <a href="//rubenerd.com/p3980/">Living Social Facebook application</a>, for those of you who were smart enough to have never registered for Facebook but therefore can’t see my obsessively generated lists.</p>
<p>This list is my own top five favourite British comedies, in no particular order. I would have put <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">Monty Python’s Flying Circus</span> on here, but I think it’s safe to say that show is an assumed given for anyone who enjoys British comedy, am I right or am I right?</p>
<ul style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">
<li>Blackadder</li>
<li>The Brittas Empire</li>
<li>Keeping Up Appearances</li>
<li>Fawlty Towers</li>
<li>Little Britain</li>
</ul>
<p>If only there was room for <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">Some Mothers Do &#8216;Ave &#8216;Em</span> too. I also love <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">Red Dwarf</span> but I’m saving that for a science fiction show list. And I guess I should attribute <span style="font-weight:bold; font-style:italic">Mr Bean</span> as well, I remember laughing so hard when I was a kid that I have fond memories of it, even if most people I know can’t stand it!</p>
<p>A top five list is definitely more difficult to think up compared to a top ten. Everything you chop off is such a hard decision.</p>
