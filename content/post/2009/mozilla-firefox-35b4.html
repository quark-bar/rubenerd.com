<p>This morning I decided to give <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html">Firefox 3.5 Beta 4</a> from Mozilla Labs a try.</p>
<p>I&#39;m really interested in a lot of what they&#39;re doing, including their development of HTML 5 support for <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> elements and closer CSS 2.1 support including text shadows. I haven&#39;t tested the former, but the latter is definitely working; not sure whether I&#39;d ever use such shadows on my own pages but it&#39;s good to see Firefox catching up to Safari/WebKit, Opera and Konqueror/KHTML in this regard.</p>

<p>According to the development page, another feature is vastly improved JavaScript support which should be most noticeable in Ajax applications. I&#39;m old fashioned and am of the opinion most Ajax online is poorly executed (plus I dislike it when sites only work with JavaScript enabled) but to be fair Gmail and Google Maps did seem quicker and the interfaces worked more smoothly; that said I don&#39;t have any hard numbers so this could all just be attributable to a placebo effect.</p>
<p>Mac users like me will be pleased to note some quite significant cosmetic changes which make Firefox look more Mac-like. Context menus now finally match Mac OS X Leopard&#39;s rounded corners, the bookmark bar has a much more subdued gradient which looks classier and the toolbar itself takes up less screen real estate.</p>

<p>Given <a href="http://rubenerd.com/firefox-extensions/">I use so many extensions</a> I admit I was worried how many of them would break in the beta; to my relief only two were, and neither are security related. SSL Blacklist (now my favourite extension alongside NoScript) in the version I had was incompatible, but updating to version 4.0.31 and the SSL Blacklist Local Database 1.0.7 fixed this. Clipmarks reports to be compatible, but alas doesn&#39;t work for me at all.</p>
