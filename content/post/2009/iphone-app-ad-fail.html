<p>It&#39;s been another very busy day today, though admittedly <a href="http://rubenerd.com/reminding-alive/">not as bad as yesterday</a>. While waiting in a queue to have my teeth pulled and to deal with a banking teller (I forget which one ended up happening) I was using the Backgrounds application for the iTelephone that does exactly what it sounds like it does. Normally I uninstall anything with advertising on it in a heartbeat, but I enjoy Backgrounds too much. If they had a paid version without advertising, I&#39;d buy it.</p>
<p>Now here&#39;s where the silliness starts. While looking for some nice scenery images I came across a page that had a series of night time shots, and below in the advertising slot there appeared a link to a website on sleep. For the first time in many years (at least 5+) I thought an online advertisement looked interesting, so I clicked on it. It took me to a website that was <strong>completely designed in Flash</strong>.</p>
<p>If the penny hasn&#39;t dropped yet, the <strong>iPhone does not have Flash</strong>â€¦ thank heavens! And yet here&#39;s a company with a website that&#39;s completely Flash driven advertising in a Google Mobile advertisement box that&#39;s intended for an iPhone.</p>
<p>It&#39;s like when I&#39;m asked if I want new carpet or a patio extension when I&#39;m living in a rented house, or when I visit a social anxiety support group website and the advertisements are for party organisers.</p>
