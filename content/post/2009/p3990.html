<p>Some random quotes from reading my latest book from the library.</p>
<blockquote style="font-style:italic;"><p>&quot;Go to Heaven for the weather,<br />

<blockquote style="font-style:italic;"><p>&quot;It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote style="font-style:italic;"><p>&quot;There is nothing so annoying as to have two people talking when you’re busy interrupting.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
