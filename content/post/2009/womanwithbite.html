<p>I haven&#39;t posted about Twitter here for over a day, so I feel as though I&#39;m obligated to again. It&#39;s certainly not as ground breaking as what Twitter is currently being used for <a href="//rubenerd.com/iranelection-twitter/">to give people in Iran a voice worldwide</a>, but it&#39;s up there. Well okay, it really isn&#39;t.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago while going through my email I was notified that <a href="http://twitter.com/Womanwithbite">@Womanwithbite</a> was following me on Twitter. I noticed she was from Adelaide and I loved her username so I reciprocated! I figured I follow a ton of people worldwide but not that many people locally.</p>
<p>In hindsight I wish I hadn&#39;t. After a few days of reading rude messages to politicians and helping to let them know that Twitter people can&#39;t be relied upon for reasoned discussion, I gave up and unfollowed her. Well okay and she was also saying a lot of silly things and I&#39;m allergic to people who distort facts! For those not well versed in Aussie politics, the Liberal Party is the broadly conservative party.</p>

Unfollowing @Womanwithbite. All I get from her is poorly worded [whinging], swearing and Liberal Party propaganda. Moving on.</p>

<p>Granted I guess I could have been a bit more civil myself (and spelling whinging correctly would have also helped!), but I like to think my response to her tweets was better than her reply:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/WomanwithBite/status/2165159890"><p>@Rubenerd Unfollowing this clown,Rubenerd. He has,without a doubt,the most boring,inane tweets of anyone I follow. Vacuuming? Care factor- 0</p>

<p>I had to hand it to her, at least she did reply! I was hoping for something better though.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd/status/2165214755"><p>I give @WomanwithBite’s rebuttal a 2/5. Was hilarious, but too predictable and lacking the bite her username implies. And I’m dusting now :)</p>

<p>What blew me away though was all the support I got from a whole heap of people who responded. Frank Nora (<a href="http://twitter.com/rampler">@rampler</a>) from <a href="http://therampler.com/">The Rampler</a> and a very close friend tweeted my favourite ones!</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd/status/2165208768"><p>
@Rubenerd wow, she doesn’t like vacuuming tweets? she’s no fun!!</p>

<p>And MannyTheMailman (<a href="http://twitter.com/mtmm">@mtmm</a>), one of the friendliest people on Twitter asked a good question!</p>
<blockquote><p>
@Rubenerd What circus do you preform with. (-: As per @Womanwithbite s tweet.</p>

<p>Whichever circus it is, they don&#39;t pay me enough :)</p>
<p>What I find interesting is that despite using Twitter since the beginning of 2007, I&#39;ve only had flareups like this a couple of times. The discourse and conversations are still far more civilised than on CNET News.com!</p>
