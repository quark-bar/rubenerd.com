<p>In <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/06/25/theMythOfPerfection.html">response to Dave Winer</a> a few days ago I discussed having <a href="http://rubenerd.com/desired-twitter/">an associated external URL with each tweet</a> was on the top of my wishlist for Twitter features. It turns out I was too hasty in posting that idea, I have an even better idea for a Twitter feature: filters.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I don&#39;t like Facebook&#39;s new <em>&quot;life stream&quot;</em> feature is because they assume I care what all my friends are doing constantly. To me, <strong>Facebook is a glorified phonebook</strong>. With Twitter, I follow people precisely because I&#39;m interested in what they&#39;re doing and saying.</p>
<p>The thing is I have a ton of warm, friendly people on Twitter I follow now, but if I read one more cringe-worthy Bible quote, or another story about swine flu (or H1N1 as everyone here in Singapore calls it) I might spontaneously combust; something I&#39;m not sure my medical insurance covers. It works both ways too, I&#39;m sure plenty of people follow me <em>despite</em> my incessant Apple and FreeBSD related tweets!</p>
<p>In the meantime I may need to start looking for a different Twitter client. I <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p1347/">moved from Twhirl to TweetDeck back in late 2008</a> and never looked back: it turns my widescreen 23&quot; monitor into something better than CNN, IRC and SMS (loving the TLAs) combined, but the filtering features are far too basic and aren&#39;t static between sessions.</p>
