<p>I was having trouble compiling Gnumeric from MacPorts and Pan this evening. Turns out <a href="http://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/x11/gtk2/Portfile">gtk2</a> was failing to build because of a problem with the <a href="http://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/graphics/tiff/Portfile">tiff</a> port.</p>
<blockquote style="font-family:monospace"><p>
root# port -v install gtk2<br />
&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&gt;  Extracting tiff<br />
On Mac OS X 10.5, tiff 3.8.2 requires Xcode 3.1 or later but you have Xcode 3.0.<br />
Error: Target org.macports.extract returned: incompatible Xcode version<br />
Warning: the following items did not execute (for tiff): org.macports.activate org.macports.extract org.macports.patch org.macports.configure org.macports.build org.macports.destroot org.macports.install<br />
[â€¦]<br />
Error: Status 1 encountered during processing.
</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#39;re being given this error message too, as the error suggests you need to grab yourself a newer version of <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technology/Xcode.html">Xcode</a>. Since I only just reinstalled Mac OS X Leopard on my MacBook Pro I installed the Xcode that came on the 10.5.6 DVD which as the error above shows is only Xcode 3.0.</p>
<p>What&#39;s curious is the Apple Software Update has never told me about a newer Xcode. Is it because you need to <a href="https://connect.apple.com/">login as a ADC member</a> first perhaps?</p>
<p>Anyway, lesson learned: make sure you have the latest Xcode before attempting to compile software or built ports on your Mac! It&#39;s not that it&#39;s darn obvious you should, but that we need reminding sometimes :).</p>
