<p>I remember reading somewhere that one of the rules of blogging is you&#39;re not supposed to explain absences. Apparently people hate them and they detract from the topic you&#39;re blog is supposed to be about.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a couple of extremely busy days, but I&#39;m back on the blogging and podcasting scene again. Thank you.</p>
<p>And by the way, does anyone find it somewhat hilarious that people write <em>books</em> about successful blogging? Does that say more about the author than perhaps they intended?</p>
