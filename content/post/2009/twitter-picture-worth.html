<p>If I rewarded daily tweets that I enjoyed with some sort of fictitious honour, today&#39;s Rubénerd Tweet of the Day would goes to <a href="http://twitter.com/GreenITers">GreenITers</a> for this message even my sister thought was clever. I like it!</p>
<blockquote cite="http://twitter.com/GreenITers/status/5096380611"><p>A picture is worth more than 140 characters […]</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not often the description of the reward itself is longer than the recipient&#39;s work. Unless I suppose its a visual representation of something, in this case a picture. Hey, come to think of it that&#39;s a fantastic segue, in hindsight I should have put that first!</p>
<p>In other news, I almost always misspell &quot;segue&quot;, &quot;hindsight&quot;, and more humorously &quot;misspell&quot;.</p>
