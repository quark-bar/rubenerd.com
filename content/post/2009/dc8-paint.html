<p>Having already typed one <a href="http://rubenerd.com/retro-business-jet/">pointless aviation related post</a>, I figured one more before I head off to bed wouldn&#39;t hurt. I call it &quot;what a bit of paint can do!&quot; The photos were both taken this year by <a href="http://www.airliners.net/photo/Air-Transport-International/McDonnell-Douglas-DC-8-73%28F%29/1595487/&#038;sid=2847201b45ebd8614888aec1a6dc964a">Jan Ostrowski</a> and <a href="http://www.airliners.net/photo/Douglas-DC-8-53/1596975/&#038;sid=2847201b45ebd8614888aec1a6dc964a">Nils Baker</a> respectively.</p>
<p>And you know I never did learn what those &quot;nostrils&quot; in the DC-8 nose were for. Were they for bleed air? Because if they were, one could say the DC-8 had aâ€¦ <strong>nosebleed</strong>! Get it? Get it? I&#39;m going to bed now.</p>
