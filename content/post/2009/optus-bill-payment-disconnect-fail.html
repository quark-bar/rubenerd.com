<p>Another quick <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/3903658302/">Optus fail</a> to talk about this morning, this time to do with being disconnected after not paying a bill. Problem is, I did pay it! Budda-boom!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>So here&#39;s the situation: last week I had an overdue bill which I couldn&#39;t pay not because I didn&#39;t have the money but because my Aussie credit union Visa debit card was being rejected. I used internet banking and confirmed I easily had the required balance to make the transaction, but Optus kept informing me otherwise.</p>
<p>After several days of trying I gave up and used my Singaporean bank card which cost me extra in foreign exchange fees but it did the job. I thought it was all over, but as of today my iTelephone is telling me I don&#39;t have a data account with Optus which I&#39;ve been told means I&#39;ve had my account suspended.</p>
<p>According to the Optus website, I don&#39;t have any outstanding payments due nor do I owe any late fees or other fees of any kind, and yet a full business day after I make the payment they disconnect me. Makes perfect sense!</p>
<p>I originally went with Optus after going to Telstra and Vodafone because the people at TeleChoice (an Optus retailer) were the most down to earth and honest, but I&#39;m starting to regret the decision. I had a Vodafone account last time I lived in Australia and aside from not being able to use it when I went into rural areas on trips it was fine. Now that my 12 month contract with Optus has expired it might be time to move.</p>
