<p>Having <a href="http://clipmarks.com/clipper/rubenerd/">used Clipmarks for a few months now</a> I feel I can finally do a proper review of it. For those who don&#39;t know, Clipmarks uses a Firefox plugin to let you easily <em>&quot;clip&quot;</em> parts of a web page, then comment on them. Once you&#39;ve submitted a clipping to your profile page you can then submit it to your own blog or to a slew of other sites. Other people can vote on your comments or leave some of their own, and if they&#39;re interested in your stream they can subscribe.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, the community is great and clipping parts of pages is very easy to do. For me Clipmarks has filled a nice niche between just bookmarking entire pages on Delicious, and commenting on stories in Google Reader.</p>

My idea was to use Clipmarks to generate the HTML for quotes I could easily import into my blog here and comment on instead of using <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code>. Unfortunately the code it generates and subsequently exports has several issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>It isn’t W3C XHTML 1.x compliant which breaks validation on pages here</li>
<li>It uses tables and other inefficient presentation markup which results in a large mess of spaghetti code that’s an order of magnitude bigger than a simple <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code></li>
<li>Because it’s derived verbatim from what you’ve clipped, if the site you’ve clipped uses invalid markup this results in errors being cross pollinated as it were</li>
<li>The default colour scheme looks acceptable in sites with light backgrounds with dark text, but not on the default colour scheme here</li>
</ul>
<p>I think the problem isn&#39;t with Clipmarks, but how I tried to use it. While I was using it for text, Clipmarks can support any payload in it&#39;s container including images, Flash videos and the like. In this light, some of my criticisms above are moot.</p>
<p>For now I&#39;ve worked around the problem by using Clipmarks to save text from pages, then simply import what I clipped here using <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> tags. The result isn&#39;t reduced work which was what I wanted in the first place, but it still means others can comment on my clips over on their site.</p>
