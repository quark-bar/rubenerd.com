<p>The colour scheme, the texture of the keys and the plastic bezelâ€¦ it&#39;s uncanny isn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>I guess the Commodore 16 and IBM&#39;s buckling spring keyboard came out around the same time, all they need is to be the same colours and it makes me feel like I&#39;m using the C16 to type up blog posts. I guess I&#39;m silly and nostaligic in that way.</p>
<p>And in case you&#39;re wondering, the Unicomp keyboard is still much louder when typing than the Commodore 16.</p>
