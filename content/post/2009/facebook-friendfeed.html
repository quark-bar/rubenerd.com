<p>A lot can happen when you&#39;re asleep! If you&#39;re on Twitter this is already ancient history because it happened hours ago, but Facebook came completely out of left field and bought FriendFeed. I agree with what <a href="http://friendfeed.com/davew/408fadb1/fb-buying-ff-is-bad-news-for-users">Dave Winer said about it</a>, that the deal can only be bad news for current FriendFeed users.</p>
<p>To use the technical social science language I have acquired from being a super 1337 online citizen for a while now, I have a Facebook account but they still kinda creep me out and this deal rubs me the wrong way. I hate the idea of general purpose gated communities where you have to log in to access material, and while there&#39;s no evidence Facebook will simply swallow FriendFeed into people&#39;s profile page news feeds to be never seen on the public internet again, it is a possibility. Even if they don&#39;t do that, I&#39;m sure we can look forward to some new archaic and scary terms of service.</p>
<p>While I had most of the feeds for my online activities connected to it, I never really used FriendFeed itself for anything except for <a href="//rubenerd.com/2009-06-08-twitter-fail/">one time</a> quite recently. I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll move all my feeds onto my neglected <a href="//rubenerd.com.tumblr.com/">Tumblr account</a> and <a href="http://friendfeed.com/rubenerd/">ditch FriendFeed</a>.</p>
<p>One of the people commenting on the FriendFeed blog about the decision said part of the reason he liked FriendFeed was that it was a social network that wasn&#39;t Facebook! Oh well, back to Twitter for short messages which fortunately <a href="http://www.techdigest.tv/2008/11/how_facebook_ne.html">was spared</a>.</p>
<p>Such rich world problems we worry ourselves with.</p>
