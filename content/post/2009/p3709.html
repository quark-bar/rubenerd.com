<p>Another day, another person <a href="http://pebblefort.blogspot.com/2009/01/think-about-it-she-had-all-those-cool.html">hotkinking images</a> I have hosted on my server here. As I&#39;ve said before I&#39;ll often include images from other sources on the net in my own blog posts, but I&#39;ll always upload the images to my own server instead so I&#39;m not wasting their bandwidth… I figure it&#39;s just common courtesy.</p>
<p>Well as of today the writers at the above linked blog <em>silently</em> uploaded their own copy of the hotlinked image and changed the URL when I submitted a comment.</p>
<blockquote><p>You do know hotlinking is a sign of the devil right? You’re not possessed are you? ;)</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps that&#39;s the key to tackling this problem; instead of sending polite emails that get ignored or at the other extreme blocking all outside requests to images, I should just leave friendly comments on offenders sites! Might not work every time, but it&#39;s worth a shot ^_^.</p>
<p>In the meantime they&#39;ve made up for it with <a href="http://pebblefort.blogspot.com/2009/01/religulous.html">their review of Religulous</a>. I thought it was much better than they did apparently, but they do raise good points. But that&#39;s a topic for another show or post. I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis.</p>
