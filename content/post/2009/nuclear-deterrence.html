<p>You&#39;d think that decades-long thing called the <strong>Cold War</strong> would have taught us all this. Kind of sad for example that <a href="http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2001/04/00_krieger_nuclear-deterrence.htm">David Krieger penned this article</a> in 2001 and so little has changed. It&#39;s sadly ironic the lengths some masochistic people will go to justify possession when they&#39;re [unwittingly I hope] justifying their enemies having them too.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is what George Orwell described as being the necessary constant threat to keep people scared, because everybody needs an enemy. Cue the conspiracy theorists!</p>
<p>Welcome to the real world I guess. I need some cheering up… perhaps I&#39;ll make a <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/grilled-cheese-sandwiches/">grilled cheese sandwich</a> :).</p>
