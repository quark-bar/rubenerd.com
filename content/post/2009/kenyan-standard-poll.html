<p>Speaking of <a href="//rubenerd.com/2009-bad-faith-awards/">voting</a>, do you think the new Kenyan Constitution should allow the public to remove ineffective MPs? So far the the <a href="http://www.eastandard.net/">Kenyan Standard newspaper poll</a> in the left sidebar has garnered 4497 votes with 94% saying yes to the idea. Seems like a smart, logical thing to enactâ€¦ so it probably won&#39;t be.</p>
<p>Ever since I was a little kid my mum and I had plans to go to Africa together. I&#39;ll go one day.</p>
