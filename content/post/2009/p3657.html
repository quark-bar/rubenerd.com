<p>Here I was thinking I could beat <a href="http://atuuschaaw.blogspot.com/">Atuuschaaw</a> and post about this story here and in my Google Reader shared items page before him, but he beat me to it. Again. Whatever he&#39;s on I&#39;d like to know what it is, where he gets it, how much it costs and what the side effects are. Actually I don&#39;t care about that last one.</p>
<p>As Barack Obama&#39;s inauguration (wow I spelt that correctly the first time!) draws closer and the world waits with baited breath to see what happens, he&#39;s already preparing with his <a href="http://change.gov">Change.gov</a> website and today he <a href="http://www.change.gov/officialportrait">officially had his portrait taken</a>. It&#39;s the first time a US president has had a digital photograph taken, very cool!</p>
<p>I know you can&#39;t judge a book by it&#39;s cover (a lousy analogy, what are blurbs for then?!) and I don&#39;t know what it is about the photo, but he looks far less cocky and much more trustworthy than that other guy. I&#39;ve already forgotten his name, what is it? Greg?</p>
