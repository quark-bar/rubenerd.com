<p>One of my latest outside projects was helping a family clean up their Windows 98 Second Edition desktop. I really pushed them to at least move over to Windows 2000 or a lightweight Linux distribution given all they used the machine for was the internet and word processing, but they were adamant about using 98. I guess you use what you’re used to.</p>
<p>If you’re still running 98 in some capacity, <a href="http://soporific.dsleague.com/">A Good Soporific</a> has easy to <a href="http://soporific.dsleague.com/main/?page_id=7">download zipped archives of all the updates</a> dated up to December 2008!</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Welcome to the new home for Auto-Patcher for Windows 98. The program still points to MSFN as the ‘homepage’ but this will change by the next release. I will always have a presence on MSFN for as long as it plays the role it is currently playing now, so you don’t have to always check here for updates, I will always post to the page that is currently the program’s homepage.</p></blockquote>
