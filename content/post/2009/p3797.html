<p>As you can tell from his link prominently displayed on my blogroll here and on my public OPML feeds and such, I&#39;m an avid reader of <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/">Jonathan Schwartz&#39;s weblog</a> over at <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun Microsystems</a>.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t own any Sun hardware (an issue of price not choice, I&#39;d love to get my hands on a <a href="http://sg.sun.com/products/desktop.jsp">Sun x64 or SPARC Workstation</a>!); I generally prefer using scripting languages to Java; while I&#39;ve dappled in <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/">OpenSolaris</a> I&#39;m still at heart a <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> guy, but I find most of what he says to be interesting and unconventional. It&#39;s rare for a CEO of a company to be so forthcoming, blunt and willing to accept comments.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> It was Jonathan Schwartz and my cousin James Ross of <a href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/productCd-0764596748.html">Beginning Algorithms</a> fame who inspired me back at the end of 2004 to try having long hair in the hopes I would look as cool with a ponytail and glasses as they do. As of 2009 my hair is finally long enough, but doesn’t suit me. Maybe I don’t have the right face… but that said, I had to try to find out!</p></blockquote>
<p>I really do like Sun&#39;s desktops, they seem to be the only company other than Apple with their <a href="http://apple.com.sg/macpro/">Mac Pro</a> that takes the extra care and effort to design clean and organised machines internally:</p>

<p>But I digress. <strong><em>Again!</em></strong></p>
<p>I meant to quote <a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/change_has_come_to_america">his Barack Obama post</a> from November last year just because I thought it was the best one I read after Obama&#39;s victory, but it got lost in the oceans of draft posts and should-have-done things. My life now seems to be filling up with two of such things for each thing I finish.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Change Has Come to America</strong></p>
<p>On behalf of Sun Microsystems, I would like to offer my sincerest congratulations to President elect Barack Obama. What an extraordinary accomplishment.</p>
<p>I would also like to extend my congratulations to his web team for having chosen <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> as the platform behind their election web site, <a href="http://BarackObama.com">BarackObama.com</a>.</p>
<p>Lest many of you get your hopes up, we cannot guarantee the White House to all MySQL users.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m pleased he clarified his position in that last line, though I admit to being disappointed I can&#39;t be politically accommodated! I&#39;ll forgive him though because, just like <a href="http://atuuschaaw.blogspot.com/">Atuuschaaw</a>, he and I share the Germanic <em>&quot;sch&quot;</em> in our names. And because all three of us aren&#39;t Bill Kurtis.</p>
