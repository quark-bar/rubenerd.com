<p>Enclosed above for your convenience and for posterity is my avatar <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenerd/">on Twitter</a> for one of the shortest-lived memes in the history of the intertubes in mid September. Lots of people had this on their avatar but I thought it particularly made sense on mine seeing as I was on a phone and all. In the middle of a canola field.</p>
<p>I would write more on this post, and I&#39;m being told I&#39;m going to be allowed to finish it, but apparently there are other bloggers who&#39;s posts are better. To be fair, I&#39;m not in disagreement with him. Because he likes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishsticks_%28South_Park%29">fishsticks</a>! Wow, two memes in one. Now that&#39;s value for money.</p>

<p>In retrospect I should have used this super cute avatar of Yui instead. I&#39;ve changed my mind, she&#39;s my favourite character along with Mio instead of just Mio; apparently I just needed to watch <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/kon/">K-On</a> again to be reminded of her awesomeness. That reminds me, I still have BluRay episodes to watch and review. Take that lowly widescreen versions! Mua har har!</p>
<p>Ima let you finish. On a side note, when I first heard about Kanye West years ago, I thought his name was Kayne (as in Cane) West. True story.</p>
