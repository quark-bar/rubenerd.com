<p>Allegedly Windows 7 would like to search me. I hope they <strong>keep it above the belt</strong>!</p>
<p>While we&#39;re on the subject, go the needlessly confusing interface. Granted I&#39;m using the Windows Classic theme because I have too much self respect to use the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/aero.aspx">tacky Aero and Aero Glass themes</a> and I enabled the menu bar because I didn&#39;t want to deal with confusing little toolbar menus, but this has got to be one of the worst application interfaces Microsoft has ever released.</p>
<p>It&#39;s as if they had a list of elements written up on a whiteboard they needed to shoehorn into Windows Explorer and they just threw them in wherever they could fit. [Windows] Internet Explorer 7 and 8 are both in a similar disastrous mess. I&#39;m not much of a fan of the ribbon interface, and I know separate units of Microsoft tend to act like separate companies, but the Windows team should employ the help of either the Xbox or Office team to fix this up.</p>
<p>The frustrating thing is <a href="//rubenerd.com/7-2k-explorer/">earlier versions of the Windows Explorer interface</a> weren&#39;t this needlessly complicated and busy. At the very least it shows they&#39;re capable. Or (gulp) they used to be.</p>
