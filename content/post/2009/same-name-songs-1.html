<p>It&#39;s an entire new blog post series here on the Rubénerd Blog! Every couple of weeks I&#39;ll be posting about two or more songs in my Exaile or iTunes playlists that share the same name. Much like my <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/fun-facts/">Fun Facts</a> and <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/grilled-cheese-sandwich-observation/">Grilled Cheese Sandwich Observation Lessons</a> these are going to be riveting, hard hitting, and as Richard Quest would say: <strong>profitable</strong>! I can tell you&#39;re all quivering with excitement!</p>
<p>Today&#39;s inaugural <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/same-name-songs-1">Rubenerd Different Songs With The Same Name</a> is <strong>In a Little While</strong> by Art Garfunkel in 1979 and Uncle Kracker in 2002. Only slightly different ;-).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always really loved that Art Garfunkel cover, my parents had the vinyl and even decorated their kitchen with the same kind of crockery I&#39;ve been told!</p>
<blockquote><p>They tell me this is the place to be<br />
All these beautiful people,<br />
And nothing to see!</p>
<p>*cliche record scratch*</p>
<p>In a little while I’ll be on my way!<br />
So hold on baby for just one more day!</p></blockquote>
