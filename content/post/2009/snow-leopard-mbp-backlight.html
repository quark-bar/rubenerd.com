<p>When I turned on my first generation Core Duo MacBook Pro <a href="//rubenerd.com/universal-binaries-for-mozilla-software/">I got in early 2006</a> this evening the backlight refuses to turn on using the function keys on the keyboard. All other keyboard functions are fine.</p>
<p>If I shine a torch at the screen I can just barely make out the windows and can adjust the brightness slider in the Display prefpanel, but nothing happens. Using an external monitor I can use the machine, but the internal display is still black.</p>
<p>Not sure whether this is a problem with Snow Leopard, I sure as heck hope so but it&#39;s looking increasingly unlikely. I didn&#39;t have the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/9ffxt/black_screen_while_installing_snow_leopard_on_a/">backlight Snow Leopard installation problem</a>, but could this be related?</p>
<p>Things I&#39;ve tried so far and have failed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Resetting the PRAM (three times)</li>
<li>Resetting the PMU</li>
</ol>
<p>This is really serious. I need to take this machine to classes. If it&#39;s a hardware failure and I can only use an external display, I&#39;m in big trouble.</p>
