<p>Some people seem to have an almost religious attachment to their text editors of choice, I need not give examples. I tend to gravitate between <a href="http://vim.org/">Vim</a> and <a href="code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a> for hacking together single files and <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> for projects, so when I started doing Java at university again I just fired up the <a href="http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Bundles/Java.tmbundle/">Java bundle</a> in TextMate and off I went.</p>
<p>Back when I was a C++ guy on Windows in early high school I used Visual Studio 6 and later C# in their .NET IDE, but since then I&#39;ve eschewed IDEs in general because I feel as though they take too much control over what I&#39;m doing, they&#39;re complicated and they keep wanting to insert their own code into my files which <strong>drives me crazy</strong>!</p>
<p>When I started uni and before my major family meltdown back in 2005 I was told to use <a href="http://www.jgrasp.org/">jGRASP</a> for Java and later <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a> and I have to admit I decided to go back to a basic text editor (<a href="http://www.nano-editor.org/">nano</a> at the time), but having just downloaded <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/downloads/index.html">NetBeans 6.7.1</a> it seems to have changed a lot in a few short years! The interface is much more Mac-like and it feels nowhere near as sluggish as it did before. I&#39;m still control-freaky enough to want to start my projects from scratch with absolutely nothing (and TextMate is brilliant for this) but there&#39;s something to be said for an IDE dedicated to the language you&#39;re using.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re a Java developer on Mac what editor or IDE do you use to create your poetic scientific whatnot?</p>
