<p>Earlier this year I decided I couldn&#39;t keep up all my disparate blogs scattered over a wider area than all that foam that ended up on the walls when our washing machine had problems, so I merged them all into this one. This means for each practical software tip there are several needlessly pointless posts such as this one that perhaps would have just gone into a journal before, but it&#39;s an infinitely easier setup. The word <strong>infinitely</strong> has lots of skinny letters in it.</p>

<p>Had an impossibly busy day today with lots of demands from many different people and from classes. I spent most of my school life taking care of my mum and fixing computer problems for people, and it seems I&#39;m still stuck in that mindset of just taking tasks people present to me and running with them without really thinking about the commitment I&#39;m setting myself up for.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a tired, worn out cliche to admit, but I need to learn to say <strong>no</strong> sometimes: perhaps I really do need a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/unisex/frustrations/c2dd/">Shirt of Ultimate Disambiguation</a>! I&#39;m more than happy to help people who are willing to learn and do a little research in advance, but I get perhaps a dozen questions a day in email, on Twitter and in person asking me how to do things and I just don&#39;t have the time. Believe me, if I didn&#39;t have work and study commitments I would be more than happy to help people with their computer problems.</p>
<p>In an interesting way though, days like this with work, studies and helping people are tough to get through as I&#39;m living it, but when I go to sleep I feel good. Like I contributed something to the world at large. I guess it really is a mindset.</p>
