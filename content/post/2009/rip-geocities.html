<p>It&#39;s quite literally the end of an era; Yahoo is no longer allowing new registrations for <a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com/">GeoCities</a> which essentially marks the end of the service.</p>
<p>The first website I ever made was in <a href="http://www.ais.com.sg/">primary school</a> computer class when we first moved to Singapore. Mr Napier taught us how to code basic HTML, insert images and use the GIF Construction Set to make animations. When it was done, our pages were uploaded to the school&#39;s website which I hastily jotted the URL down for and told my family back in Australia about!</p>
<p>When that school year ended I moved the site to GeoCities which at the time organised you into neighbourhoods depending on the content you were hosting: I went with <em>&quot;SiliconValley&quot;</em>. Later when Yahoo bought them out and they introduced URIs based on usernames I changed to http://www.geocities.com/rubenerd. After a few years I moved over to <a href="http://tripod.lycos.com">Tripod</a> over at <a href="http://lycos.com">Lycos</a> before getting a paid webhost and my GeoCities account was deleted due to a lack of activity. What I wouldn&#39;t give to see that page again!</p>
<p>I guess it was inevitable that GeoCities would be discontinued eventually; it&#39;s just a shame it wasn&#39;t managed properly and was essentially left to languish. It was bigger than Jesus back in 1997.</p>
<p>RIP.</p>
