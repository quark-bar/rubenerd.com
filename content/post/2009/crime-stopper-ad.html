<p>At BankSA Crime Stoppers, our advertising is as up to date as our technology! I kid, they do valuable work, but you&#39;d think while they rearranged their advertising layout for widescreen HD television they would have updated the graphics and the pictured mobile phone handset too.</p>
<p>Though with all that said, ironically if its an analogue phone it probably has better sound quality than our current mobile phones! Wait hold on I&#39;m typing this in Safari on my iTelephone and its complaining about a lost data connection.</p>
