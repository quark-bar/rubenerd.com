<p>Little tip for Mac users who take their laptops out with them while forgetting there&#39;s still an optical disc spinning and vibrating in a drive that they don&#39;t have a case for, there are two quick things you can do!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p><strong>Tip the First:</strong> simply fire up a Terminal and enter:</p>
<pre># umount [-f] [volume name]</pre>
<p><strong>Tip the Second:</strong> go to Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Disk Utility.app, select the optical drive and click Unmount. In either case, the optical disc will stop spinning which will make your laptop quieter and save battery life, but it&#39;s still protected from not being taken out of the drive without a case.</p>
<p>Just like that Mercedes Benz radio advertisement in Singapore, it&#39;s not that we don&#39;t know these things, it&#39;s just sometimes we need a little reminder :).</p>
