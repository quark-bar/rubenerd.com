<p>I read a report somewhere that people of my generation tend to stay in contact with our parents far more than previous generations did. I&#39;m not sure how much of that is societal or whether it&#39;s because it&#39;s just cheaper and easier to do now wherever we are, but I&#39;d say it definitely holds true for us here.</p>
<p>I try to contact my dad at least twice a week on Skype because especially since my mum died we&#39;ve become really close friends. He&#39;s still obviously an authority figure when it comes to certain whatnot, but for the most part I talk to him now the same way I talk to friends. We didn&#39;t break our longest running record yesterday afternoon on Skype, but 1 hour 54 minutes is still pretty damn impressive!</p>
