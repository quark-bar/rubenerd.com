<p>Ever wanted to send me a free camera lens, some new Apple computer hardware or other gifts for free but didn&#39;t know my postcode? Well here&#39;s a service I didn&#39;t know existed until this morning, and I&#39;m kicking myself for not finding it sooner.</p>
<p>If you go to <a href="http://www.singpost.com.sg/quick_services/index.htm">this Singapore Post website page</a> you can enter an address or a building and it will return the postcode. Sure enough, I entered 16 Balmoral Park which is where we live in Singapore and it returned 259847.</p>
<p>Given Singapore&#39;s tiny geographic size and densely concentrated population, their 6 digit postcodes are used not for suburbs (which Singapore really doesn&#39;t have many of) but for individual building complexes. It&#39;s a fantastic, elegant idea for so many reasons!</p>
