<p>Do you all remember that long winded rant post I wrote on Sunday where I was having so much trouble <a href="//rubenerd.com/p3835/">paying my phone bill with Optus</a> that I gave up doing it online?</p>
<p>Well I was told by a person at the Optus shop today that as an iPhone user I was registered automagically with their Optus Zoo service and that they’d sent me a password to it. By logging into Optus Zoo, I can pay my bills online there instead. Brilliant I thought, so I rushed home and attempted to login to Optus Zoo.</p>
<p>What was it that Homer Simpson said when he was laughing at the never ending previews at the beginning of a movie he was watching? <em>&quot;I’m laughing! But it’s a laugh of impatience!&quot;</em></p>
