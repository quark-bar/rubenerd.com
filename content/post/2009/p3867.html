<p>Browsing through <a href="http://www.thorninpaw.com/mt/archives/cat_art_and_design.html">Thorn In Paw’s</a> archives to kill some time, I came across this photo by Callie Shell. It was taken in 2007 so in political terms it’s documenting ancient history, but it’s still just as relevant now.</p>
<p>The caption from the site:</p>
<blockquote><p>A Mother’s Grief: This woman had lost her son in Iraq. She wanted people to know that it was not unpatriotic to be against the war and for Obama. Cedar Rapids, Iowa, 2/11/2007.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve always found the convolution of military service and patriotism to be kind of creepy. While certainly not perfect, I like how the Singapore government talks about and advertises the idea of what they call <em>&quot;Total Defence&quot;</em>. The idea is, doing your job well, helping your community, being well educated and so on are just as important to protecting a society as the people guiding the missiles. In bus shelters they show people in camouflage uniform standing next to someone wearing a business shirt, or a stethoscope, or a school textbook. You get the idea.</p>
<p>Even if (as my cynical side assumes) it is just hollow propaganda in disguise, I think certain people in the US and other parts of the world could benefit from thinking like that. Unfortunately I doubt they ever will though.</p>
