<p>Greenthings and salmonations,</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve been redirected to this blog post expecting to find the <strong>Rubenerd Forum</strong>, I decided to close it because it seemed to be just a magnet for spambots alas. Now that the Rubenerd Show and Blog are hosted here on software that support comments, you can leave feedback on the individual shows themselves which I reckon makes more sense anyway.</p>
<p>If you&#39;d like to take a trip down memory lane, you can download a completely self contained archive of the forum I downloaded with <a href="http://www.httrack.com/">HTTrack</a> before taking it offline.<br />
Windows is the only major OS that doesn&#39;t support bzip2 out of the box, but <a href="http://www.7zip.org/">7zip</a> can make light work of it, and it&#39;s free.</p>
