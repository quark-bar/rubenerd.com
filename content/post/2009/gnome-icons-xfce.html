<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/3616007325/" title="Xfce with Gnome icons by rubenerd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3635/3616007325_f1aa0eec94.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Xfce with Gnome icons" /></a></p>
<p>For a bit of a change in <a href="http://xfce.org/">Xfce on my </a><a href="http://freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> machines I&#39;ve decided to eschew the <a href="http://tango.freedesktop.org/">Tango Project<a /> iconset and use the </a><a href="http://gnome.org/">Gnome Desktop</a> icons available from the <a href="http://www.freshports.org/x11-themes/gnome-icons/">ports collection</a>:</p>
<pre>
# cd /usr/ports/x11-themes/gnome-icons
# make install clean
# echo &quot;Grilled Cheese Sandwiches&quot;
</pre>
<p>They&#39;re very classy and quite minimalistic which really appeals to me, and even though I use Xfce instead of Gnome which the icons were originally designed for, they work smashingly. Did I just say &quot;smashingly?&quot;</p>
<p>Now if only the folder icons weren&#39;t that dull sand colour we&#39;d be in business!</p>
