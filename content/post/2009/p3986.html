<p>As it turns out, shortly after I compiled my list of <a href="//rubenerd.com/p3983/">Favourite British Comedies</a> yesterday I realised I had left some critical shows out which caused me once again to bang my head repeatedly on the table in front of me, causing me further stress.</p>
<p>I have rectified the situation by creating a part two list, which I’m sure is cheating! So that I could include other types of shows and not just comedies I called this list Favourite British TV Shows, Part Two.</p>

<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Yes Minister</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Yes Prime Minister</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Midsomer Murders</span> (I’ve read the books too)</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold">Jeeves and Wooster</span> (brilliant! And I’ve read the books too)</li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold">A Bit of Fry and Laurie</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight:bold">SuperTed</span> (the memories…!)</li>
</ul>
<p>I read on Google Reader that Kelli hadn’t heard of most of the shows I’d listed; I’ve been told that British TV shows are much less popular and well known in the US than in Australia. For me, on the whole I find British shows to be more realistic, more subtle and wittier than shows made in the US, with the notable exception of gems like Arrested Development, M*A*S*H and Boston Legal. If you’ve never seen any before, you’re missing out on a real treat.</p>
<p>In fact, I reckon I can think of more to fill a third list. I don’t have time to be doing this stuff, but it’s just too much fun! Maybe next I need to do a British Drama or Detective list.</p>
