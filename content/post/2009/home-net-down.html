<p>Since early this morning our home Internet connection has been down for some reason (I&#39;m typing this on my iPhone through its painfully slow Aussie data plan directly) which has made my assignments far more complex and has turned my work I do in Singapore from here into a disaster. Hopefully I won&#39;t be gone from here for too long, but I&#39;ve now got even more work to do.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to need a break from this so called mid semester break!</p>
