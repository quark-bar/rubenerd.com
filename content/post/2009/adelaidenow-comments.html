<p>Two comments I submitted on articles on the AdelaideNow website (the online version of the Adelaide Advertiser):</p>
<blockquote><p>
<cite><a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,25458631-2682,00.html">Australian’s not buying local produce</a></cite></p>
<p>AUSTRALIANS will stand up for the flag and the anthem but not for their mates when it comes to buying Australian, a study suggests.</p>
<p>An Australia SCAN survey shows only 28 per cent of consumers consider buying Australian-made goods necessary.</p>
<p>In 1995, 46 per cent of Australians ranked it highly.</p>
<p>Social analyst David Chalke said that as the recession continued, people would become even less inclined to buy domestic products which cost more than an imported alternative.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we’re going to hunker down a bit more,&#8221; he said.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I would love to buy Australian and help people here, but as a computer guy I don&#39;t have a choice than to buy from overseas, all the stuff I get is from the US, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan and Korea. Even though I&#39;m Aussie I&#39;ve lived most of my life overseas and I realise the reality that some places are better at producing things than other places, it&#39;s Economics 101. Food I proudly buy Australian at the supermarket not just because &quot;it comes from here&quot; but because of it&#39;s superior quality.</p>
<p>Perhaps with further local development and investment in education I could one day buy my electronics from Aussie companies too; I certainly believe the entrepreneurial spirit and creativity needed are already here.</p>

<p>THE much-vaunted $118 million Gallipoli underpass &#8211; open for just over six weeks &#8211; has become a nightmare for commuters during afternoon peak-hour.</p>
<p>Thousands of motorists are now being caught in anp exasperating daily crawl &#8211; but authorities say drivers will have to put up with the problems for now.</p>
<p>During Friday night’s rush hour, traffic banked up more than 1.5km between the Anzac Hwy turnoff on South Rd to Greenhill Rd.</p>
<p>The almost daily gridlock occurs because Anzac Hwy commuters are forced to give way to south-bound underpass traffic.
