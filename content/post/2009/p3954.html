<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Yes, this was an April Fools joke!</p>

<p>I’ve become a &quot;fan&quot; of conservative Aussie opposition leader <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Malcolm-Turnbull/">Malcom Turnbull</a> on Facebook. This photo of him presenting behind a Microsoft sign that says <em>Innovation</em>, <em>Community</em>, <em>Trust</em> and <em>Security</em> in Canberra cinched it for me. Microsoft especially for me has always been about <em>Trust</em> and <em>Security</em>, but I wish they could have made room for <em>Modest</em> and <em>Humble</em> too.</p>
<p><a href="http://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_(Australia)">The Coalition <span style="font-size:x-small">[Wikipedia]</span></a>… Australia needs both and needs both now!</p>
