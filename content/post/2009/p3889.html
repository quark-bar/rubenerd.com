<p>Now that I have my <a href="http://imaging.nikon.com/products/imaging/lineup/digitalcamera/slr/d60/index.htm">Nikon D60</a> I’ve been doing my best to learn as much as I can about photography and lenses. I can already tell this has the potential to be an extremely engaging and terribly expensive hobby!</p>
<p>One of the lenses I’m most looking forward to is the upcoming AF-S DX NIKKOR 35mm f/1.8G which Nikon has <a href="http://nikon.com.sg/productitem.php?pid=1310-8934b9b612">information on their website</a> about.</p>

<p>From my own research scanning various sites online, it’s going to be a great, lightweight (around 200g) affordable prime lens for those of us with lower end Nikon DSLRs because it’s AF-S will allow us to autofocus with it. Sweet.</p>

<p>I’ve been having a ton of fun with my incredibly sharp and lightweight <a href="http://nikon.com.sg/productitem.php?pid=106-387119c054">AF NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8D</a> taking photos of still life nature and urban cityscapes (my personal favourite photographic subjects) but it’s high speed for taking photos of moving objects is negated somewhat by it’s inability to autofocus on the D60. Okay I admit it, it’s a problem with the <strong><em>photographer</em></strong>: If the subject is far enough away I can just set the focus close to or at infinity and set the aperture up a few levels to improve the depth of field, but for a random pretty butterfly zooming past or someone trying to steal my camera bag my reflexes just aren’t fast enough to focus and photograph them before they’ve moved. At high speed though it can still take super sharp images even if I’m shaking; no need for VR on this baby! But I digress.</p>
<p>My very good high school friend Felix Tanjono first told me about it; I get the feeling we’ll both be getting ones and trading tips, very cool!</p>
<p>Anyone else have a Nikon DX camera and are planning to get this lens?</p>
