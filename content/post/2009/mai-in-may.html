<p>It&#39;s a fresh new May month already, isn&#39;t that crazy? We&#39;re almost half way through 2009! Get it? She&#39;s Mai… from Mai HiME! Get it? Get it? Hey, I thought it was funny. Get it?</p>
<p>Yes I know this is a <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p1146/">shameless reproduction</a> of I post I wrote exactly one year ago to this day. It&#39;s called recycling folks, last time I checked everyone thinks that&#39;s a good idea… right? Or am I getting that confused with <em>&quot;reusing&quot;</em>?</p>
<p>Come to think of it, what&#39;s the difference between <em>&quot;reuse&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;recycle&quot;</em> anyway? Is one using something again in the same condition and the other deals with re-manufacturing something from existing materials? If that&#39;s the case, why not call it <em>&quot;reremanufacture&quot;</em>? Rolls off the tongue much easier doesn&#39;t it? Does it?</p>
<p>I&#39;ll stop now.</p>
