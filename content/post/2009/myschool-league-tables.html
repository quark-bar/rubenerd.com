<p>The Aussie government seems to be going ahead with their plans for their MySchool website that will publish school marks and rankings. In an interview on <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/">Lateline</a> I just watched, <a href="http://www.aph.gov.au/house/members/member.asp?id=83L">Julia Gillard</a> assured us all league tables would <strong>not</strong> be generated. Unfortunately, she&#39;s wrong.</p>

<p>I think what she meant to say was the <strong>Australian Government</strong> would not be generating league tables. As Alex and I discussed on Twitter, put enough statistics and information online and someone will come along and make a mashup of it. As soon as this MySchool site goes online, it won&#39;t be a question of <strong>if</strong> league tables are generated with the published data by third parties, but <strong>when</strong>.</p>
<p>I really wonder sometimes if politicians in governments such as Australia&#39;s have any idea of the implications of their policies. Sometimes their actions make me wonder!</p>
