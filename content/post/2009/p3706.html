<p>So this afternoon I was sent a link from a well meaning friend to download a compressed archive of photos. If it were me I would have just uploaded the lot to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/">Flickr</a>, but there you go.</p>
<p>The link he send me was to <a href="http://megaupload.com">MegaUpload.com</a>, one of the more popular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-click_hosting#One-click_hosting">one click file hosting sites (Wikipedia link)</a>. While I admit they are useful for people who don&#39;t have a web host of their own and want to share large files with friends, I tend to dislike using them because they&#39;re clumsy to use… <em>by design</em>.</p>
<p>The best business model the people running these sites have been able to come up with is providing a free, throttled service for people wishing to download content that they&#39;re friends want to share with them, with the promise that if you purchase a subscription the number of files you can download at a time increases and download speeds will be an order of magnitude higher.</p>
<p>But it&#39;s not that simple. Instead of just limiting the download speeds, these sites try all sorts of dodgy tricks. You&#39;re never allowed to start your download instantly, you have to wait just under a minute before the link &quot;activates&quot;, during which time you&#39;re presented with a vague list of benefits you can claim if you pay. When the link finally appear it often doesn&#39;t work, and when you finally get a link that works the download often times out Murphy&#39;s Law style just when you&#39;re about to finish. Most one click file hosting sites have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA (Wikipedia link)</a> input fields, some of which are simple (like MegaUpload) and some are so difficult to read you can miss out several times.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> At this point I’d really like to use stronger language… but I’m restraining myself :). Who knows, my year 12 English teacher might be reading this. Or my 8th grade Chemistry teacher. Wait, where was I?</p></blockquote>
<p>Forcing users to pay for decent download speeds for material that the company hasn&#39;t even created themselves as they watch their current download crawl along at the rate of 4% an hour isn&#39;t blackmail, but I reckon it&#39;s close to it.</p>
<p>Sure there will be a few people who will whip out their credit cards and hand over a pile of cash so they can get what they&#39;re supposed to, but it baffles me that they think they can attract more customers by treating new users like this. It&#39;s hardly a glowing example of their service if it takes hours to download a file that should only take minutes. I certainly wouldn&#39;t want to give such a company any money after putting up with their awful service, and I suspect I&#39;m not the only one!</p>
<p>To be fair, MegaUpload is much better than other sites such as RapidShare, but it still relies on Flash which isn&#39;t available on FreeBSD or 64bit Linux and JavaScript which I have <a href="http://noscript.net/">disabled in my browser by default</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve downloaded the file, but I will be advising my buddy in Germany to use alternative methods next time. I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis.</p>
