<p>I&#39;m certainly not suggesting that the posts I write here are free of spelling mistakes, but I&#39;ve seen this word written this way enough times by enough people in blogs, comment threads and forums that I feel I need to say something.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> And no I’m not taking about people saying they keep <strong><em>&quot;loosing&quot;</em></strong> their <strong><em>&quot;lose&quot;</em></strong> cables! Though that’s something I could easily rant on for hours about too!</p></blockquote>
<p>Ridiculous is spelt <strong><em>&quot;ridiculous&quot;</em></strong>, not <strong><em>&quot;rediculous&quot;</em></strong>. Spelling ridiculous as rediculous just makes you look… well, you know where I&#39;m going with this.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis.</p>
