<p>For those of you subscribed to my blog through an aggregator using the <a rel="nofollow" href="//rubenerd.com/feed/">old URL for the RSS feed</a> instead of <a href="//rubenerd.com/feed/">the new one</a>, you may have noticed four recent posts with identical timestamps. You probably don&#39;t care why this happened, but I&#39;m so excited I just have to relay it!</p>
<p>When I <a href="//rubenerd.com/we-are-back/">moved from Servage to Segment Publishing</a> because the former was absolutely awful and because I had so much success with the latter for other projects, I also took the opportunity to move the site back to Rubenerd.com which I had previously lost to domain squatters. RubenerdShow.com was still with Servage, but all it contained was a simple <code>.htaccess</code> script to redirect all requests to the new domain.</p>
<p>Well as of today, I finally got around to moving the domain off Servage and onto Segment Publishing including said text file. This means, FINALLY, I am completely, 110% off Servage. I don&#39;t have <em>anything</em> hosted with them <em>whatsoever</em>. Clear as mud!</p>
<p>I&#39;m putting the finishing touches on my post detailing what an awful webhost Servage is but it won&#39;t be ready for a few days. Another post I&#39;m positive you&#39;re all anxiously awaiting ;-).</p>
