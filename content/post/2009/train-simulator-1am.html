<p>Sometimes a short train trip late at night through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marias_Pass">Marias Pass</a> train route in northern Montana with the 2001 era DirectX graphics and sky is just what I need to relax just before going to sleep.</p>
<p>I first got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Train_Simulator">Train Simulator</a> in 2002, it was the first game I tried on my desktop at the time, the first game I tried running with Boot Camp with my then-new MacBook Pro in early 2006 (<a href="//rubenerd.com.com/widescreen-windows-gaming/">Windows gaming on a MacBook Pro</a>), and is still one of the reasons I keep a copy of Windows XP lying around for the 3D acceleration in software like <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/tag/vmware-fusion/">VMware Fusion</a>.</p>
<p>For someone who moved around so much as a kid and could never have huge trainsets, this was the closest I ever got, and I still find it fun :).</p>
