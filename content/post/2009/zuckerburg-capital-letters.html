<p>It seems Mark Zuckerberg has started <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=54155118564&#038;ref=search&#038;sid=2225864.1421872157..1">poking fun</a> at the folks who adamantly hate the latest in a string of <a href="//rubenerd.com/facebook-changes-again">new Facebook changes</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I HATE CHANGE AND EVERYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH IT</p>
<p>I WANT EVERYTHING TO REMAIN STATIC THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE LIFE</p>
<p>I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I WANT FROM THINGS I CANNOT CONTROL</p>
<p>BY LOGICAL DEDUCTION I AUTOMATICALLY OPPOSE THE NEW FACEBOOK STREAMING HOME PAGE</p>
<p>IF I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS GROUP IT IS NO LONGER FUNNY</p></blockquote>
<p>First, good on Mark for ignoring the people who made him rich and telling them what they should want and expect, and secondly good on him for <strong>getting away with it</strong> while people still use it, those people afraid to leave because &quot;other people use it&quot;. He&#39;s a marketing genius!</p>
<p>Personally, I can&#39;t wait for another five years to pass when Facebook becomes MySpace and Friendster and there&#39;s a new service people are using. Given the string of companies and services lying in the dust behind it, it&#39;ll probably be just as closed and suspect as Facebook, but one could always dream of an alternative open system that has data independence and a bit more accountability.</p>
<p>You&#39;ve got to love the people setting up groups on Facebook demanding they change the site back. As long as they&#39;re still using it, Facebook management couldn&#39;t care less what they post about! The only way they&#39;d start to care is if Facebook stopped growing and people started leaving it for another service which in the short term they know people won&#39;t do. Perhaps it&#39;s akin to people like me using hashtags to spread awareness of causes on Twitter that doesn&#39;t end up achieving anything but we all feel good doing it.</p>
<p>On a related note, other people have tagged me in photos but I haven&#39;t updated my Facebook profile since early October. In social networking terms, that&#39;s an eternity!</p>
