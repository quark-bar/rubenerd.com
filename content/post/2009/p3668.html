<p>While checking my server records I noticed I was getting a few hits from <a href="http://blogged.com/">Blogged.com</a>. It seems they <a href="http://www.blogged.com/blogs/rubenerd-blog.html">added my blog to their database</a> and filed me under <em>&quot;miscellaneous&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;management&quot;</em>. Funny how my blog has as much to do with management as an <em>echidna</em> would have to do with a <em>large shoehorn</em>, but there you go. The miscellaneous tag I&#39;m not disputing, but then again wouldn&#39;t every self respecting blogger have more than a few miscellaneous posts in their blog that were off the primary topic?</p>
<p>Anyway they&#39;ve given me a bunch of HTML to include to verify that this is my blog. I&#39;m not going to put it in my template file (on principal and because I don&#39;t want advertising on here), so putting it here is the next best thing. By encapsulating their code into a simple blockquote on a post I also keep my stuff and their stuff separate and apart. That&#39;s right, separate and apart, at the same time. You&#39;d better believe it.</p>

<p>Yet another example of a blog post I could have condensed into just one sentence, it didn&#39;t need to be this long. Grilled cheese sandwiches.</p>
