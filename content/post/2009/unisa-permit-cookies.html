<p>As well as having heard it from many prominent security experts, from personal experience now I&#39;ve come to expect there&#39;s a trade-off between <strong>security</strong> and the <strong>human need for convenience</strong>. Despite there being a slew of faster and <a href="//rubenerd.com/stability-firefox35/">more reliable</a> browsers than Firefox I choose to use it <a href="//rubenerd.com/firefox-extensions/">for the extensions</a> which make my browsing more secure and private, while accepting that such plugins may break some sites.</p>
<p>I can now add my university email account to the mix: after an interface upgrade whenever I attempt to login to it with the Permit Cookies extensions enabled I can&#39;t get past the above screen even if I add the network to my whitelist. It is the first time a site has still refused to play nicely with this plugin even after whitelisting, very weird.</p>
<p>Looks like I&#39;ll be setting up my beloved Camino browser to take care of university whatnot. Now there&#39;s a slick, fast and lightweight browser!</p>
<p>In the meantime I&#39;ll contact the university IT help desk. Given this is the science and engineering campus here I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only Firefox and Permit Cookies users here having this problem, at least I hope I&#39;m not!</p>
