<p>Here&#39;s an idea for a <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a> feature that in my opinion is <strong>long overdue</strong>. If Reader attempts to fetch a web feed and it encounters a <strong>301 permanent</strong> redirect to a legitimate new address it should update its own records in user accounts to point to the new address instead of still pinging the old one.</p>
<p>I ask for my own selfish reasons because as of now more people are still subscribed to my blog here through the old http://rubenerdshow.com/feed/ address instead of <a href="http://rubenerd.com/feed/">http://rubenerd.com/feed/</a>. Each request to the old URI takes more effort and bandwidth than the new one, and I&#39;ve noticed items that appear in the new one instantly can sometimes take an hour or longer to appear in the old one. An automatic update would fix this.</p>
<p>Good idea?</p>
