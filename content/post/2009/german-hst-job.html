<p>For an introverted guy, I could think of plenty of worse places to work than the deck of an German ICE train, or any other HST. Looks comfy. For what it&#39;s worth I <em>did</em> put in many hours of <a href="//rubenerd.com/widescreen-windows-gaming/">Train Simulator years ago</a>. Thank heavens I&#39;m not a loser… right?</p>
