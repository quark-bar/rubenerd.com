<p>Pardon the French, but it&#39;s now official if we didn&#39;t already suspect it: the people in charge of old media companies are… well, morons. <a href="http://current.com/items/90049647_sony-pictures-ceo-im-a-guy-who-doesnt-see-anything-good-having-come-from-the-internet-period.htm">According to Current.com</a> (thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/Tarale">@Tarale</a> for the link), Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton had this to say about the internet:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://current.com/items/90049647_sony-pictures-ceo-im-a-guy-who-doesnt-see-anything-good-having-come-from-the-internet-period.htm"><p>
<strong>&quot;I’m a guy who doesn’t see anything good having come from the Internet,&quot;</strong> said Sony Pictures Entertainment chief executive officer Michael Lynton. <strong>&quot;Period.&quot;</strong>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I was going to launch into my own detailed rebuttal discussing how the internet has reduced the barriers to entry for so many creative people and businesses around the world that could not have had their material published and sold before, but why do it when someone else has already said it better. From <a href="http://current.com/users/slarabee.htm">Slarabee</a> in the comments section:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course he does see anything good coming from the internet. Information should only be for those that can afford to buy it, control it and use it to make more money and screw the masses.</p></blockquote>
<p>If people like Mr Lynton are representing their way of thinking, traditional media companies are in an even more disastrous shape than I ever could have imagined.</p>
<p>Pardon the French again, but… what a jackarse!</p>
