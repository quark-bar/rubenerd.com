<p><a href="http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,25172357-2682,00.html">AdelaideNow is reporting</a> that a tornado and freak storms ravaged parts of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia with as much as 37mm of rain falling in less than an hour and a half. Adelaide isn’t in it’s path but they say it could potentially reach Mount Gambier, Naracoorte, Bordertown and Lucindale.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bureau of Meteorology is warning &quot;severe thunderstorms&quot; are likely to produce very heavy rainfall and flash flooding across the south-east in the next few hours. An updated warning will be issued at 8.45pm.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>SECURE</strong> or put away loose items around your property.</li>
<li><strong>MOVE</strong> cars under cover or away from trees.</li>
<li><strong>STAY</strong> clear of fallen power lines.</li>
<li><strong>NOT</strong> to drive, ride or walk through flood water.</li>
<li><strong>KEEP</strong> clear of creeks and storm drains.</li>
<li><strong>REMAIN</strong> indoors and away from windows, while storms are nearby.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having lived in the tropics most of my life I’ve had my share of huge, loud and scary thunderstorms, but certainly not a tornado. Until now I wouldn’t have known what to do if I did encounter one… aside from jumping out of my skin.</p>
