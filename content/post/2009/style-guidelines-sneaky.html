<p>When you work for a publication you&#39;re presented with a series of style guidelines you have to follow in your work, if I&#39;m to believe what people in the bidness have told me. Senior members of Rubenerd Blog management (myself and my teddy bear) have been complaining about a series of style issues for our blog here, mostly to do with names.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<ol>
<li>If the name <strong>eBay</strong> or an Apple <strong>iThing</strong> is the first word in a sentence, do you capitalise it?</li>
<li>For anime like <strong>K-On!</strong> and sites like <strong>Yahoo!</strong>, do you keep the exclamation marks even if you’re in the middle of a sentence?</li>
<li>For Japanese names like <strong>Her Senjougharaness</strong>, do you use <strong>ou</strong> or risk older browsers only rendering <strong>ō</strong> instead? Is that a concern?</li>
<li>When talking about projected Microsoft products, because it’s regarding an American company do we spell it <strong>vaporware</strong> instead of <strong>vapourware</strong>?</li>
<li>Is <strong>GCS</strong> an acceptable acronym for grilled cheese sandwiches given it also stands for the <strong>GNU Coding Standards</strong>?</li>
<li>Is it okay to refer to them as <strong>grilled cheese sandwiches</strong> in the first place so we reach a wider audience than if we called them <strong>jaffels</strong> which, while being technically a better name, only Aussies would know what we’re talking about?</li>
<li>Is it a sign of madness that a lone blogger considers a teddy bear to be a member of his blog’s senior management?</li>
<li>Did this list lose relevance after point 3?</li>
<li>Is the <strong>Bird</strong> the <strong>Word</strong>?</li>
</ol>
