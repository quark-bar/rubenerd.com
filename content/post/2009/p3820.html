<p><a href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a> (aka del.icio.us) is a simple online bookmark service which <a href="http://delicious.com/rubenerd/">I’ve been using for years</a> and have promoted here many times. By having your bookmarks online and taggable they’re much easier to find later, and because they’re hosted remotely you don’t need to worry about which machine you bookmarked a particular page on.</p>
<p>I’ve found though having mostly moved back to Mozilla Firefox from Camino and Safari that the official Delicious bookmark add-on is really bloated and unnecessary. Instead, the easiest way to use Delicious I figure is the same as with every other browser: using the <em>&quot;bookmarklets&quot;</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://delicious.com/">Delicious</a> and log into your account</li>
<li>Click the <em>&quot;Help&quot;</em> link in the top right corner</li>
<li>Click <em>&quot;<a href="http://delicious.com/help/tools">Bookmarklet buttons for any browser</a>&quot;</em></li>
<li>Drag and drop the <em>&quot;Add to Delicious&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;My Delicious&quot; links to your linkbar.<br />
</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Many sites also include &quot;Add to Delicious&quot; links on their pages as well which makes it even easier. People who do this may not be Bill Kurtis, but they’re really intelligent, attractive people I’ve heard. Uh, yeah ^_^.</p>
<p>I don’t know what I would do without Delicious.</p>
