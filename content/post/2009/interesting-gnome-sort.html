<p>Here&#39;s something interesting that I thought was interesting and took my interest because it was interesting. If you click About on the Help menu in applications written for the <a href="http://gnome.org/">Gnome desktop environment</a> and click Credits you can view the people who wrote the program which is pretty cool, but you&#39;ll notice they&#39;re ordered by first name not surname.</p>
<p>I thought that was highly interesting, didn&#39;t you?</p>
<p>This should really have been formatted as a <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/fun-facts/">Fun Fact</a>.</p>
