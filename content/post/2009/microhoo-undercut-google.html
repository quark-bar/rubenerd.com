<p>The <a href="http://rubenerd.com/boohoo-microsoft-yahoo-paraphernalia/">prophecy has come true</a>! In a kind of half-arsed way. Too bad the shirts from February 2008 <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/boo_hoo">are no longer available</a>.</p>
<p>So here&#39;s the deal: Yahoo and Microsoft have formed a partnership of sorts where Yahoo uses Microsoft search technology and Microsoft leverages Yahoo&#39;s media and eyeballs &#8212; I think. Our attention is naturally drawn to Google, the dominant search engine in the English speaking world and how much of an effect (if any) Microhoo will have on it.</p>
<p>As I mentioned here already, <a href="http://rubenerd.com/dana-gardner-twitter/">Dana Gardner and I briefly talked</a> on Twitter about the possibility of Microsoft using it&#39;s newly acquired clout to undercut Google on price and in effect kill off their only major source of revenue. It&#39;s an interesting prospect; certainly history is ripe with examples of formerly big companies that Microsoft has taken down with such shrewd (and sometimes legally dubious) tactics. The word dubious is.</p>
<p>In the short term though I don&#39;t see it happening. The assumption here is Microsoft and Yahoo can offer a lower priced product; in this case paid search advertising; and therefore take customers away from Google. As with GNU/Linux on netbooks though, price alone has been shown not to be enough to get people to change. The other simple fact is it&#39;s not a level playing field. Google commands the lions share of the search market, if people want to do business online they go to Google.</p>
<p>When I first heard about Microhoo 2.0 I <a href="http://rubenerd.com/microhoo-formidable/">made this diagram to illustrate</a>. To preempt any negative comments, yes it is very exaggerated but it makes my point!</p>

<p>Could this change in the medium to long term? With Microsoft&#39;s previous MSN, then Windows Live, then Bing efforts I felt bad for them, but with Yahoo it&#39;s a possibility. Adding two failing ventures doesn&#39;t automatically create a successful one though; if they both largely continue business-as-usual nothing will change.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a brilliant move on Microsoft&#39;s part; they got to butcher Yahoo without having to spend much money at all. Not sure what&#39;s really in it for Yahoo.</p>
<p>I tell you what though, I&#39;m nervous about logging into my Flickr and Delicious accounts and seeing Bing logos everywhere. What about people with Yahoo email accounts?</p>
