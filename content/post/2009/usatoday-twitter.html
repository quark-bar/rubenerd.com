<p>I haven&#39;t done something like this in several years on my blog here, but <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-08-24-online-tweet-twitter_N.htm?csp=usat.me">this one article I read in the USA Today</a> just begged to be investigated by a computer science student who uses and loves Twitter and who&#39;s supposed to be doing homework.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-08-24-online-tweet-twitter_N.htm?csp=usat.me"><p>SAN FRANCISCO — Dave Magnusen has never used Twitter, yet it bugs him.</p>
<p>&quot;It’s a form of communication, but it’s not very social,&quot; says Magnusen, 55, a database administrator in Durham, N.C. &quot;You can’t ignore (Twitter), but it’s kind of sad how it’s replaced people talking.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s right, I don&#39;t make dozens of international phone calls a day because I don&#39;t have the money or time, it&#39;s because Twitter makes me not want to talk! Glad we got that straightened out.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-08-24-online-tweet-twitter_N.htm?csp=usat.me"><p>Tony Fuda feels the same way. The Niles, Ohio, native is particularly irked by tweets that insist on sharing the most mundane details of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we really need to know that you just put your pants on, just brushed your teeth, just ordered a hamburger, just finished dinner, just walked out of the bathroom?&#8221; he says.</p></blockquote>
<p>If he&#39;s not interested, why does he read them? Why are we also not hearing about how he finds certain magazines he doesn&#39;t have an interest in mundane?</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-08-24-online-tweet-twitter_N.htm?csp=usat.me"><p>Magnusen’s and Fuda’s gripes underscore a strong undercurrent of resentment — and incredulity — by non-Twitter users toward the social-media service used by tens of millions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just like popular fiction in the eyes of literary critics, if lots of people like it, it can&#39;t be good.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-08-24-online-tweet-twitter_N.htm?csp=usat.me"><p>Earlier this month, Twitter bashers had another reason to send their tongues wagging: A new study concludes that 40% of tweets are &#8220;pointless babble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pear Analytics categorized 811 out of 2,000 random tweets over two weeks as babble. It categorized 751 (38%) as conversational, 174 (9%) as moderately interesting and 117 (6%) as self-promotional. Spam accounted for only 4%, or 75, of the tweets.</p></blockquote>
<p>So in other words, Twitter has a higher percentage of useful material than the Internet in general? Why is this being presented as a bad thing?</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-08-24-online-tweet-twitter_N.htm?csp=usat.me"><p>Callie Greenberg is not sweet on tweets. &#8220;I can’t stand it,&#8221; says Greenberg, 25, a medical-sales rep in Denver who is a loyal Facebook user. &#8220;Twitter is basically the same as updating your status on Facebook — only 20 times a day. It’s overuse, almost stalkerish. Get a life.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem with using sweeping generalisations is most often they&#39;re complete nonsense. Twitter is not &quot;basically the same&quot;; you use Facebook to keep in contact with friends, you follow people on Twitter because you&#39;re interested in what they have to say.</p>
<p>If you &quot;can&#39;t stand it&quot; Callie, don&#39;t tell people who find it useful to &quot;get a life&quot; and <strong>don&#39;t use it</strong>. Very simple.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-08-24-online-tweet-twitter_N.htm?csp=usat.me"><p>Many bemoan the loss of face-to-face communication among a generation of people glued to their smartphones, netbooks or websites.</p></blockquote>
<p>All but half a dozen of the 270+ people I follow live overseas, and I&#39;m sure if you talk to most other Twitter users they&#39;d say the same, if you had bothered to while researching your story.</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2009-08-24-online-tweet-twitter_N.htm?csp=usat.me"><p>&#8220;It’s a look-at-me technology that seems to be more about vanity and competition than about information,&#8221; says Jason King, 32, of Maysville, Ga. He does not use Twitter or Facebook.</p></blockquote>
<p>I use it to keep in touch with people I care about and who I&#39;m interested in. If that&#39;s vanity and competition about information, then call me a vein competitor!</p>
<p>Bottom line folks: if you don&#39;t get Twitter or don&#39;t see how it could be useful to you, don&#39;t use it. Very simple.</p>
