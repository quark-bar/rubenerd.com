<p>I’ve had to temporarily disable the <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/6623">BetterPrivacy</a> extension because since I upgraded to <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Firefox 3.0.8</a> I get the above error message every single time I close the browser. Upon clicking it, all the browser windows disappear but Firefox stays active for anywhere between 5 to 30 seconds in the dock before finally quitting. It’s quite irritating!</p>
<p>Given it’s a JavaScript error I suspect perhaps it’s having a conflict with NoScript but disabling that extension still renders the above error. I’m running Firefox 3.0.8, BetterPrivacy 1.25, NoScript 1.9.1.6, Cookie Monster 0.97.0 and SSL Blacklist 4.0.30: as far as I know all the latest versions.</p>
<p>The error mentions <code>NS_*</code> (stands for NeXTSTEP, what Mac OS X was built from) which leads me to believe it may be a local problem. Anyone else having this issue?</p>
