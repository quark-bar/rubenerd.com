<p>At a time eerily close to when I was writing my previous post about Steve Jobs&#39; health and the end of MacWorld, it seems a rumour is spreading that <a href="http://cultofmac.com/apple-ditching-macworld-in-favor-of-ces/6800">Apple may in fact appear at CES</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apple is ditching MacWorld to instead exhibit at CES next year instead, according to one source.</p>
<p>The source, citing “friends who work at Apple,” insisted the company is ditching MacWorld because it will “go large” at CES, which typically runs concurrently with MacWorld in early January.</p>
<p>The International Consumer Electronics Show, or CES, is the big annual gathering [of] the consumer electronics industry. Held in Las Vegas over several days, it attracts more than 2,700 companies from all over the world, including technology giants like Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo.</p>
<p>Apple has never had a presence at the show, exhibiting at MacWorld instead.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m treating this rumour from a friend from a friend from a friend as… well, a rumour. Still it presents an interesting scenario: Apple competing head to head with their arch rivals under one roof at CES would certainly be quite a spectacle.</p>
<p>While I love Apple products and the Mac OS X operating system, if Apple does something that I think is stupid or if they&#39;re caught making something up, I call them out on it, as I hope I do with every technology company who&#39;s products I use and endorse.</p>
<p>I will be interested to see how Apple&#39;s diehard apologists explain this after they&#39;ve been explaining Apple&#39;s decision to leave MacWorld was about giving up on expensive trade shows. If this CES appearance rumour is true, that whole argument has just been shot down in flames.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be most interested to see Daniel Eran Dilger over at <a href="http://roughlydrafted.com/">Roughy Drafted</a> explain this. I&#39;ve thought his coverage of Apple related topics have been spot on in the past, but <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2008/12/17/why-did-apple-bail-on-macworld-expo/">his post last year about why Apple ditched MacWorld</a> was uncharacteristically shaky. Will he be able to reconcile this CES appearance after he&#39;s been saying the trade show paradigm is dead and Apple ditched MacWorld to save cash and to release products on their own schedule instead? I don&#39;t see how he&#39;ll be able to do it.</p>
<p>Then again this is just a rumour, and as with most rumours I suspect it&#39;s bogus. If it turns out to be true though, prepare to read some serious backtracking across the blogosphere!</p>
