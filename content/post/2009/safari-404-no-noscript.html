<p>Hehe Safari 4.0.4… I suppose if it doesn&#39;t download properly you get a 404 error? <strong>HA!</strong></p>
<p>Moving on, I just finished downloading the new Safari 4.0.4 release. Reviewed in one sentence: its one slick, fast browser. As <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=818361&#038;page=7">I said on MacRumors</a> though (and was promptly ignored) there&#39;s still one huge reason why I can&#39;t use it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Each new release of Safari makes it even harder to be a Firefox user, and 4.0.4 is no exception I’ll tell you that. Its beautiful and fast even on my 32bit Core Duo MBP.</p>
<p>The only thing holding me back still is a lack of a NoScript alternative for Safari. Having got used to blocking JavaScript and selectively enabling it only on sites I trust in Firefox for so long makes me nervous about using anything else.</p>
<p>Unless there is a Safari extension/plugin that does offer that functionality that I’m not aware of, granted it’s been a while since I’ve really checked.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suppose vendor lock-in comes in many forms.</p>
