<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/bsd.daemon.png" alt="" style="height:182px; width:168px; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px; display:inline" /> <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p3765/">Food poising is not fun in the slightest</a>, but fortunately by using a combination of soothing music and Tiger Balm my headache as of a few hours ago is completely gone. Mary Wallace and my GP suggested I eat bread, rice, apples and toast of which I&#39;m eating right now. Provided I don&#39;t get out of this computer chair and don&#39;t eat too quickly I think I&#39;ll be fine.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I thought I&#39;d share another quote, this time from the <a href="http://forums.freebsd.org/showthread.php?p=6784">FreeBSD forums</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>the daemon you know is better than the penguin you donâ€™t.<br />
~ danger@</p></blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s referring of course to BSD (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_Daemon">daemon</a>) and Linux (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux">pengiun</a>).</p>
<p>Reminds me of another similar quote by someone who I can&#39;t recall right now who said [paraphrasing] the best programming language for a job is the programming language you&#39;re best at and enjoy.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been learning a new programming language and a new OS to keep my mind sharp while I&#39;m on holidays, you&#39;ll see the reviews of these in upcoming days. Ironically I started learning these because I thought I needed to broaden my horizons and get out of my FreeBSD, Mac, Ruby and Perl comfort zone. Those two quotes above pretty much shoot that down in flames don&#39;t they? I don&#39;t mind though, I still find them fascinating.</p>
<p>Without sounding too cheesy, I love learning new things, or using old things in new ways. It&#39;s one of the greatest pleasures in life.</p>
