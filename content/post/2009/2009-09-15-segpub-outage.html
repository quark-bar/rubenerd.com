<p>Another <a href="http://segpub.net/">SegPub</a> outage this afternoon, this time lasting from around 14:32 to 14:52 South Australia time. Fortunately I wasn&#39;t using the domain for any of my afternoon classes like the last outage did.</p>
<p>This time I did a traceroute and checked the status of the site using a foreign server and recorded the results. I&#39;m hoping this isn&#39;t becoming a regular occurrence, but I&#39;m going to be keeping my own records of such events.</p>
