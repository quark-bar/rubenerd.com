<p>It&#39;s very much in vogue in the anime community to bash K-On! because it&#39;s supposedly shallow, has weak characters and a plot that&#39;s only there to show cute girls in various situations, but I thoroughly enjoyed it for it&#39;s high life escape value ^_^.</p>
<p>My current desktop background is this of Mio from the light music club. I guess it&#39;s a typical otaku fantasy to be friends with a cute, shy girl and I&#39;m falling right into the nerdy anime stereotype, but I find Mio very endearing. Besides, it&#39;s a nice design and scales beautifully on my new 1920&#215;1200 display. Or screen, or whatever it is this thing is called.</p>
