<p>For some reason I like the softer focus in this shot. The depth of field had to be narrower so I could shoot the picture faster to compensate for my overly jittery hands. At least with a 50mm 1.8 it can collect much more light in a shorter time.</p>
<p>This is another type of shot you just can&#39;t plan for. Like a really bad cold. Wait, that didn&#39;t sound terribly good. Need some work on holding cameras more steadily when standing though.</p>
