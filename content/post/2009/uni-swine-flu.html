<p>While my site was in limbo over what I&#39;ve uncreatively dubbed the <a href="//rubenerd.com/189-transfer-limit/">bandwidth overshooting of May 2009</a>, I got an email from <a href="http://unisa.edu.au/">the university</a> about swine flu. Well this afternoon I recieved another message. They really do seem to be taking this seriously.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear students,</p>
<p>As you may be aware, the number of cases of H1N1 in Australia is continuing to rise â€“ as at 5:00am on Monday 1 June, Australia has 302 confirmed cases, with 6 confirmed cases in South Australia. The University is closely monitoring any possible impact of the spread of the virus on UniSA staff and students. The University has protocols in place to support staff and students and to minimise both the risk and disruption to campuses and the University as a whole. There are currently no confirmed cases among UniSA staff or students. Should UniSA have a confirmed case of H1N1, students at risk will be contacted and advised accordingly.</p>
<p>It is important to remember that simple hygiene helps protect against any infection. The World Health Organisation provides excellent advice on precautions to avoid the spread of viruses (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/frequently_asked_questions/what/en/index.html). Students who develop any flu-like symptoms are urged to stay away from University campuses and seek medical attention. If you need particular advice, please call the National Swine Influenza hotline on 180 2007.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Professor Peter Lee<br />
Deputy Vice Chancellor: Academic
