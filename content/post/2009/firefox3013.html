<p>After posting a few weeks ago about how I&#39;d downgraded back from the Firefox 3.5.x series to Firefox 3.0.13 <a href="http://rubenerd.com/stability-firefox35/">because of serious stability problems</a> I&#39;ve been overwhelmed by the feedback I&#39;ve got from <a href="http://rubenerd.com/stability-firefox35/#comments">people here on the blog</a> and through Twitter and email saying they&#39;ve had the same problems. Not since I started using Phoenix 0.2 when I was in high school have I ever had to downgrade Mozilla software, it really is that bad.</p>
<p>The problem is Mozilla has (possibly intentionally) made it difficult to locate the downloads for the 3.0.x series which is still being maintained and supported. I admit when I gave up and decided to downgrade I used a copy of 3.0.6 I still had on an external drive then used its internal software update feature to bring me up to 3.0.13.</p>
<p>Fortunately since then I found my ISP here in Adelaide has a globally accessible mirror for Firefox 3.0.13 which you can find here:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://mirror.internode.on.net/pub/mozilla/firefox/releases/3.0.13/">http://mirror.internode.on.net/pub/mozilla/firefox/releases/3.0.13/</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I think it&#39;s safe to say the 3.5.x series is still beta quality software and should be treated as such, meaning when I advise people about what software they should use on production machines I&#39;ll be strongly suggesting they use 3.0.x.</p>
