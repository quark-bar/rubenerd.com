<p>Another bomb rocked Baghdad yesterday killing 69 people; Farrah Fawcett and Michael Jackson, two of the biggest names in entertainment passed on; and Belgian singer Hilde Rens (Yasmine was her stage name) suddenly took her own life. Twitter was awash with discussions over all of them.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t know what more I could contribute to the discussions other than to say they were all too young. One thing is for certain, the world is going to be a very different place without them.</p>
<p>As for Michael in particular, I may not have admired the guy but as a kid from the 1980s I grew up hearing his music. To me, hearing one of his songs propelled me to my life before I moved to Singapore when I was little, particularly when we still lived in Melbourne and my life was completely different. It was quite jarring to hear that he&#39;d just left so suddenly.</p>
<p>Someone on Twitter mentioned that the 80s have officially now died.</p>
