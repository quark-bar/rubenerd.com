<p>Three nonsense posts in a row? That&#39;s pushing it a bit isn&#39;t it? Well to be fair if this were printed in paper this would be of greater concern given paper is a physical product that&#39;s made from trees, whereas electrons are generated from trees which are decomposed, compressed and put into furnaces to drive turbines several million years later. See the difference?</p>
<p>Anyway logging into eBay this evening to do my daily check to make sure nobody was selling my soul in a jar or my image on a grilled cheese sandwich or an image of my soul in a jar on a grilled cheese sandwich, I was informed by the super intelligent eBay data mining service that the above list of products were tailored <em>&quot;just for [me]&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>Now to be fair, the coffee machine is a reasonable guess, but what they didn&#39;t take into account is I already have one and it barely gets used because I spend my life studying and doing work in coffee shops.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, I&#39;m not going to comment on the other items. Then again Nurie did say I look androgynous enough to cosplay as a female character. I think it&#39;s something to do with the hair. Good thing I&#39;m getting it mostly cut off tomorrow.</p>
