<p><strong>Merci, merci, das ist gut!</strong> Wait a minute.</p>
<p>My dad, sis and I have decided to go back to France on our Eurotrip at the end of the year if only for a few days. Last time I went there was 1998, wonder if its changed much since then? And I insist on buying a beret this time! I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll go down really well wearing that around Deutschland and Eire.</p>
<p>Wait, why did I use the real names for them but I called it France? Wait a minuteâ€¦ again.</p>
