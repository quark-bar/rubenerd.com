<p>No double entendres intended. &quot;Entendre&quot; sounds like a boardroom invented name for a cheapie budget sedan. Sedan rhymes with van… despite vans not being sedans. Well, I guess if you lowered the roof and took out most of the seats it could become a sedan for the purposes of road tax and insurance. My favoruite bread rolls are German Semmel rolls with Leberkäs.</p>
<p>This was a worthwhile exercise, we must do it again sometime. Thank you.</p>
