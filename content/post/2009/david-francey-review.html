<p>With the exception of most country music, I&#39;ve thoroughly enjoyed listening to music on <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/">Whole Wheat Radio</a> when I can. I pretend it&#39;s <em>primarily</em> because I enjoy supporting independent musicians, but the main selfish reason is actually because I just like the music!</p>
<p>Of the artists I&#39;ve heard and subsequently researched myself is <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Artists:David_Francey">David Francey</a>, a Scottish musician who lives in Canada. Usually I&#39;m not such at a loss for words to describe music (or wine, or coffee), but for some reason this was the best review I could give!</p>
<blockquote cite="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Artists:David_Francey"><p>I know I tagged David’s artist page here ages ago, but having just heard him sing again I felt I needed to put something here. As I’ve eluded to previously here I’m not a music expert (and the irony isn’t lost on me that I’m saying this on a music site) and therefore don’t know what words I’m supposed to use to describe this art form, but I do know what I like and I love David Francey’s music. A frustratingly vague review I know, but just putting it out there :). &#8211;<a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/User:Rubenerd">Ruben</a> (<a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/User_talk:Rubenerd">talk</a>/<a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Special:Contributions/Rubenerd">contribs</a>) 23:41, May 14, 2009 (AKDT)</p></blockquote>
<p>A few of his CDs are on my CD Baby wish list. When I get paid for my next project I might indulge in some, along with some delightfully offbeat hilarity in the form of <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Artists:Eric_Schwartz">Eric Schwartz</a>. ^_^</p>
