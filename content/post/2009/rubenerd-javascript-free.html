<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/3678149462/" title="Clear day in Singapore by rubenerd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3616/3678149462_1ccfdb6bb7.jpg" width="500" height="335" alt="Clear day in Singapore" /></a></p>
<p>I noticed this afternoon while going through my comment moderation queue that <a href="//rubenerd.com/">Rubenerd.com</a> was running a bit sluggishly. Like I would if I ever ran anywhere presumably.</p>
<p>The culprit? A line of JavaScript designed to download and display <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/">my latest photos from Flickr</a>. Seems it was hanging on that particular part of the page and deciding not to go any further. So I got rid of it, and now my site is running faster than it ever has! Not sure whether I&#39;ll do something server-side to replace it&#39;s function, or whether my link to my Flickr page in the header along with linked images in posts here like I&#39;ve done above will suffice.</p>
<p>Aside from some Ajax websites that behave more like applications than web pages such as Google Docs, I dislike JavaScript on pages. It&#39;s cool now I can say I don&#39;t have any on my own site. Have <a href="http://noscript.net/">NoScript</a> in <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Firefox</a> or <a href="http://pimpmycamino.com/parts/caminoscript-10">CamiNoScript</a> in <a href="http://caminobrowser.org/">Camino</a>? My site will work exactly the same!</p>
