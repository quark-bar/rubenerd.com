<p>Sitting at the <a href="http://theboatdeck.com.au/">Boatdeck Cafe</a> in <a href="http://mawsonlakes.com.au/">Mawson Lakes</a> this morning for breakfast (I know it will shock you to hear I was there) I overhead the following conversation between two women justifying why they started smoking cigarettes:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Person 1:</strong> It’s, like, not fair to hate something you, like, haven’t tried.<br />
<strong>Person 2:</strong> I know right? I mean, its like, duh!</p></blockquote>
<p>Fair enough. I&#39;ve never attempted to inject myself with anthrax, so it wouldn&#39;t be fair for me to say I <strong>hate</strong> it. Could I get around this restriction by being more flexible with my language by saying I <strong>loathe</strong> it instead? Or <strong>detest</strong> it?</p>
<p>In related news, it&#39;s a good thing they ban smoking in cafés here. Not that I personally have ever smoked in a cafe and therefore it wouldn&#39;t be fair for me to say I hate it apparently!</p>
