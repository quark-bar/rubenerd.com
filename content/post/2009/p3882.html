<p>This morning I needed to download and install some software that was contained in a *.sit file. Mac users would recognise this as a StuffIt archive, an older style compression system that started falling out of favour with more recent versions of Mac OS X.</p>
<p>So I needed to get myself a copy of <a href="http://my.smithmicro.com/mac/stuffit/index.html">StuffIt Expander</a> to open the file, fair enough. These were the steps I had to take:</p>
<ol>
<li>Googled <em>&quot;StuffIt Expander&quot;</em>, clicked the first link</li>
<li>Looked at all the confusing options on their page, found <em>&quot;Get Expander for Free&quot;</em> link in the corner and clicked.</li>
<li>Another product pitch to get me to buy the full version? Sheesh! Clicked the <em>&quot;Expander 2009 Download&quot;</em> link.</li>
<li>I need to fill out my name and email address to get the download link, unless I want the trial of the paid version? Gah!</li>
<li>Went to <a href="http://www.mailinator.com/">Mailinator</a> to register for a temporary email address</li>
<li>Returned to the former page, filled out my name and email address.</li>
<li>Went back to Mailinator and opened the email they sent which contained the download link.</li>
<li>Was taken to a blank page with a link to click <em>&quot;if I’m not redirected&quot;</em>. Clicked link.</li>
<li>Clicked download link to CNET Download.com.</li>
<li>Clicked <em>&quot;Download Now&quot;</em> link on Download.com.</li>
</ol>

<p>It was a good thing I registered for a temporary email address, because check out the email they sent me with the download link:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks for your interest in Stuffit Expander.<br />

<p>Can you believe that? If anything this experience has taught me that I don’t want the pro version of their product, I want nothing to do with them whatsoever! Not only did they take forever to give me the link to download their product, but they subscribed me to their junk mail by clicking on their link which if I didn’t use a temporary address would be filling my inbox as we speak.</p>
<p>Unbelievable. <img src='http://rubenerd.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':-(' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
