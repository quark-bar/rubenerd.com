<p>There seems to be a theme developing here. In <a href="http://rubenerd.com/break-photos-01/">part one</a> of my mid semester walk around the park photo set I had images of ducks and other aviary animal critter thingys, and in <a href="http://rubenerd.com/food-in-nature-photos/">part two</a> I had photos of plants that looked like breakfast cereals. True story.</p>

<p>Here we have some photos of flowers I thought were particularly pretty and all that. If anything these serve to show I have yet to master the art of composition, but at least they make nice desktop backgrounds :).
