<p>It&#39;s official folks, the <a href="http://www.hongkongpost.com/">Hong Kong Post Office</a> certificate registrar uses the secure SHA1 hash algorithm not the <a href="//rubenerd.com/protect-yourself-against-md5-certificates/">now-vulnerable MD5</a>. <a href="http://www.grc.com/securitynow/">Security Now</a> in-joke :-)</p>
<p>For what it&#39;s worth, the official title for the Hong Kong government is sure a mouthful isn&#39;t it? And here I was thinking the various Australian government departments had unnecessarily long and complicated names!</p>
