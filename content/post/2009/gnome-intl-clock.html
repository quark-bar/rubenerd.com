<p>I won&#39;t be giving up <a href="http://xfce.org/">Xfce</a> on my <a href="http://freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> desktop any time soon, but <a href="http://gnome.org/">Gnome</a> on <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/thinkpad-x40/">my ThinkPad X40</a> keeps finding new ways to surprise me. Its a beautiful thing, and its free!</p>
<p>This might be an old feature, but its one I&#39;ve found wildly useful: the ability to set locations in the panel clock. Other desktops let you do this, but it&#39;s all the little extras that Gnome does. Perhaps <a href="http://kde.org/">KDE 4.2</a> does, I haven&#39;t had the chance to try yet.</p>
<p>When you define a series of locations they appear on a map of the world complete with an approximate night/day cast. Under the map each location is shown with digital and analogue clocks, and what I&#39;ve found absolutely brilliant is each timezone is displayed relative to where you are, <strong>NOT</strong> to GMT! For example I can see Singapore is 1:30 behind us here in Adelaide, and <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Jim Kloss</a> is 17:30 behind.</p>
<p>By default it&#39;s turned off, but if you use Gnome click the clock on your panel and click <strong>Locations</strong>.</p>
