<blockquote><p>&quot;For all those whose cares have been our concern,<br />
the work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives<br />
and the dream shall never die.&quot;</p>
<p>~ Edward M. Kennedy</p></blockquote>

<p>With the passing of the current heathcare bill in the American House of Representatives, I thought it was fitting to share. You were an inspiration to the world Mr Kennedy, here&#39;s hoping one day your vision will actually come to pass in the United States without any lame exceptions, opt outs and half arsed support.</p>
<p>When I had my recent flu here in Australia, I made my way down to my local GP here in Mawson Lakes, presented my universal healthcare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_%28Australia%29">Medicare card</a>, left without paying anything, and when I got the bill for my blood test I went to Medicare in the city and claimed a refund with almost no questions asked. And then there&#39;s the government run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medibank_Private">Medibank Private</a>. Neither are perfect, but I suppose their existence makes Australia an un(free, patriotic, Christian) super evil red Communist dictatorship.</p>
<p>Despite living in Singapore most of my life I&#39;m not sure how their universal healthcare plan works, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_Singapore">according to the World Health Organization</a> it has the lowest infant mortality rate in the world (equalled only by Iceland) and among the highest life expectancies from birth.</p>
