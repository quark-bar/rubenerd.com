<p>Since my MacBook Pro&#39;s latest in a long and painful run of <a href="http://rubenerd.com/inverter-bulb-mbp/">hardware problems</a> I&#39;ve been entertaining the idea that I might have to replace it sooner than I thought. Since I got my iBook G3 back in 2001 it&#39;s never crossed my mind to ever look at laptops other than Macs, talk about brand loyalty!</p>
<p>A lot has changed with me since I got my MacBook Pro in 2006 though. For one thing, I&#39;d barely used Linux in any serious way before then and now I&#39;m more than comfortable with FreeBSD and several Linux distributions. The vast majority of the software I use on my Mac are cross platform that were originally designed for Linux such as OpenOffice.org, Gnumeric, VLC, The Gimp, UFRAW, Inkscape, Thunderbird, Firefox and Midnight Commander. When I use my ThinkPad X40 &quot;netbook&quot; with Debian Linux, I&#39;ve been surprised by how ergonomic it is to use and how little I&#39;ve missed from my Mac other than perhaps fonts, and iTunes to syncronise my iTelephone.</p>
<h3>Brace yourselves!</h3>
<p><strong>I think I could picture myself not using an Apple computer.</strong> Have you picked yourself off the floor yet? Apple computers have always been a pleasure to use and Mac OS X is fantastic, but they&#39;ve never been the most reliable machines with hardware, at least in my own experience.</p>
<p>As I&#39;ve said many times, the other line of computers I&#39;ve always liked alongside Apples have been ThinkPads, and looking at the specifications for their <a href="http://shopap.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/auweb/LenovoPortal/en_AU/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=3634951826AE4D3881BFFF1AC5FCD957&#038;current-category-id=5EA2563AABAE4F3190E07D81EDD1B87E">T400s</a> and the <a href="http://shopap.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/auweb/LenovoPortal/en_AU/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=3634951826AE4D3881BFFF1AC5FCD957&#038;current-category-id=D8D4B38B0A514BC29CDF3E49FC6823CE">T400</a> with discrete graphics they&#39;re are very competitive, sleek machines for much less than a MacBook Pro. Not only that, but they have expansion slots not just a SD card adapter and a decent number of USB ports! Of course the ThinkPad will come with some ugly flavour of Windows not Mac OS X, but that&#39;s something that can be overwritten with a real OS. Wonder if you can get refunds on Windows licences?</p>
<p><strong>I&#39;m bluffing and kidding myself of course</strong>, I&#39;ll probably get a unibody MacBook Pro when I can afford it, but like a religious person who used to be <strong>certain</strong> they knew their creator but has read one too many books on evolution and now has small inkling of doubt, if I do decide to get a Mac again, it won&#39;t be after giving a PC serious consideration for the first time in 8 years. That&#39;s already a huge change for me. Don&#39;t think Steve will lose much sleep though as long as I&#39;m still buying.</p>
