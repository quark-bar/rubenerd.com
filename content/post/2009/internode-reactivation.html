<p>For the first time in weeks I now have a home internet connection and a <a href="http://rubenerd.com/new-mbp-inverter-worked/">working MacBook Pro</a> upon which to use it! It&#39;s true you don&#39;t know what you&#39;ve got until you lose it!</p>

<p>So here&#39;s what happened. On Friday last week I contacted Telstra and finally managed to get our home phone line reconnected; why it was disconnected is a long and boring story that I&#39;m in too much of a good mood to relay. Despite having a working telephone line, our <a href="http://internode.on.net/">Internode</a> home ADSL connection we <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p1291/">signed up for in August last year</a> still wasn&#39;t working, but an Internode tech support guy got back to me fairly quickly explaining why:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi Ruben,</p>
<p>Your ADSL connection was disconnected along with your phone service. It is best to contact our Sales team on Monday to look at having this done.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions regarding this matter, please reply to this email or contact our Helpdesk by phone.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br />
Andrew</p></blockquote>
<p>I admit I my heart sank at the prospect of having to wait over the weekend, then go into the city on Monday, get the account reactivated and wait for a further 2-7 business days to have it put through. Despite only going into their Sales office this morning though, as of early this afternoon we had home internet again!</p>
<p>Kudos to the Internode team for their ridiculously fast service :).</p>
