<p>While I&#39;m holidaying back at my dad&#39;s place in Singapore I&#39;ve thought I&#39;ve been having some pretty bad nights again, but it&#39;s nothing compared to what he&#39;s going through. He&#39;s designing a new manufacturing plant in Woodlands and suffice to say the disagreements between the designers, engineers and managers are all being funnelled through to him. You&#39;d have to have a darn thick skin to cope with stuff like that.</p>
<p>After going to bed at a ridiculous hour having only arrived back from the plant a few hours ago, it&#39;s almost time for him to wake up againâ€¦ at 5am. I&#39;ve managed to drag myself out of my comfortable bed to see him off and to tell him to break a leg, but here I am barely able to keep my eyes open after sleeping for six hours. Luxury!</p>
<p>Here&#39;s hoping he can finish earlier today and we can grab a bite to eat afterwards. I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis.</p>
