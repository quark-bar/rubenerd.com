<p>I&#39;m in the market for a new mouse. After two years of fairly reliable service, my Apple Mighty Mouse has started exhibiting that <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?&#038;q=mighty+mouse+scroll+ball+fail">maddening scroll ball problem</a> and its time to upgrade. New toy!</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>The latest <a href="http://www.apple.com/sg/magicmouse/">Apple Magic Mouse</a> is a work of art (as to be expected from Apple!), but alas without  a third mouse button it&#39;s just not feasible for the times when I&#39;m booted into FreeBSD, OpenSolaris or Linux and I don&#39;t want to constantly swap mouses around. Before going Apple I was a <a href="http://logitech.com/">Logitech</a> guy because they were the most comfortable and well designed, so I&#39;m thinking of going back and checking them out again.</p>
<p>The only requirement I have aside from lots of awesome buttons I can customize is Bluetooth. Don&#39;t get the wrong idea, I really dislike Bluetooth and constantly pairing my mouse with my MacBook Pro feels like a tiring and maddening exercise in futility sometimes, but I never have any spare USB ports and USB hubs won&#39;t work.</p>
<p>Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte recently recommended on <a href="http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-222.htm">Security Now 222</a> the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/mice_pointers/mice/devices/5846&#038;cl=us,en">Logitech Anywhere MX</a> with the fantastic low friction scrollwheel but alas it needs a USB receiver. The <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/mice_pointers/mice/devices/5845&#038;cl=us,en">Logitech Performance Mouse MX</a> is positively droolworthy, but has the same problem.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell the only Bluetooth Laser mouse they have is the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/mice_pointers/mice/devices/3287&#038;cl=us,en">Logitech V470</a> which my father uses and is very happy with, but it doesn&#39;t have their Darkfield Laser Tracking technology which allows it to track on more surfaces, and only has a regular scroll wheel.</p>
<p>Perhaps I could get an ExpressCard with extra USB ports, or perhaps a powered USB hub. That&#39;d work :).</p>
