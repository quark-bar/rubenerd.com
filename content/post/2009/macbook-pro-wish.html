<p>Lots of rumours going around regarding an update to the MacBooks. While MacRumors does say the average time between updates has elapsed, I can&#39;t see them doing anything drastic before the back-to-school specials in the States. An updated 15 inch MacBook Pro might be more likely though.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been saving and holding out for an upgrade to my first generation MacBook Pro for a while now, but with each new offering I feel the difference in performance wouldn&#39;t justify the cost of a new machine.</p>
<p>My problem is I spend half my time in Adelaide and half my time in Singapore which limits me to using a portable computer as my primary production machine unless I want to only have it for six months a year. I&#39;d also prefer not to have to buy external LCDs to hook it up to because I just don&#39;t want to deal with cable mess!</p>
<p>A current 17&quot; MacBook Pro with the gorgeous 1920&#215;1200 screen would be the ultimate desktop replacement powerhouse I could take with me from Singapore to Adelaide and vica versa, but alas even for a nerd like me I can&#39;t justify spending AU$4000 on a new machine!</p>

<p>There are many things Apple could announce in a new 15&quot; MacBook Pro including the ultra high capacity non-removable battery from the 17&quot; model, a quad core CPU to make me slightly less envious of those who can use desktops, an internal 3G data antenna, a Jim Kloss waffle iron with built in pickle dispenserâ€¦</p>
<p>What would be the killer feature for me, and I&#39;ve been saying this for years, is a higher resolution display. The <em>biggest</em> archilies heel of my current MacBook Pro isn&#39;t it&#39;s 32bit CPU but it&#39;s 1440&#215;900 display: it&#39;s plenty wide enough to use as a primary display but it&#39;s just not tall enough for scrolling large documents. My Philips 19 inch LCD from 2003 had 1280&#215;1024 which had more vertical real estate.</p>
<p>Given Apple bumped up the 17&quot; from 1680&#215;1050 to 1920&#215;1200 as standard, surely they could help a guy like me out by bumping 1440&#215;900 to 1680&#215;1050 in the 15&quot; model. Dell and HP even offer 15&quot; notebooks with 1920&#215;1200 so it is possible!</p>
<p>A 15&quot; MacBook Pro with a 1680&#215;1050 display dual booting AMD64 FreeBSD and Mac OS X Snow Leopard would be the ultimate machine!</p>
