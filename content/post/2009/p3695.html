<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/2/hi/technology/7852340.stm">The BBC is reporting</a> Microsoft&#39;s opinion of their latest web browser offering: Internet Exporer 8:</p>
<blockquote><p>Microsoft has stepped up the battle to win back users with the latest release of its Internet Explorer browser.</p>
<p><strong>The US software giant says IE 8 is faster, easier to use and more secure than its competitors.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;We have made IE 8 the best browser for the way people really do use the web,&#8221; said Microsoft’s Amy Barzdukas.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, data from Net Applications showed the software giant’s market share dropped below 70% for the first time in eight years to 68%.</p></blockquote>

Internet Explorer 8 might be easer to use than 7 (and here&#39;s hoping the interface isn&#39;t as messed up too, for people who have no choice), but real world performance once it&#39;s released will be the real test of its security.</p>
<p>Microsoft has a history of delivering the aforementioned claims, but not the results. This is slowly changing, but they&#39;ve got a very, very steep climb ahead. I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis.</p>
<p>The story was summarised by the BBC in their RSS feed this morning as a question addressed for people who had jumped ship:</p>
<blockquote><p>Will Microsoft’s new browser help persuade users who have flocked to other alternatives come back to Internet Explorer?</p></blockquote>
<p>A few perhaps, but certainly not me or anyone I advise.</p>
