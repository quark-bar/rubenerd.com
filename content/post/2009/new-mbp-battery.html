<p>Having got fed up with the woefully bad battery life in my second MacBook Pro battery, I decided to bite the bullet (or the bank card as it were) and procure myself <a href="http://store.apple.com/au/product/MA348G/A?mco=NDcxMzc1NQ">a new battery</a>. The previous battery I used was a third party unit I bought at Sim Lim Square in Singapore which when new had amazing life but degraded into a device that could barely hold a charge in far too short of a time. This new Apple battery might have cost an arm and a leg, but provided it <a href="http://apcmag.com/macbook_pro_battery_recall.htm">wasn&#39;t manufactured by Sony in 2006</a> it&#39;s far more reliable.</p>
<p>I&#39;m getting on average about 3:30 of power a charge which is enough for most lectures and classes with this new battery. Not having to arrive to classes nine hours early every day so I can guarantee myself a power point seat is such a refreshing change!</p>
<p>I&#39;m in the process of writing another post on priming batteries and getting more life out of them, but I want to hold off publishing it until it&#39;s finished; I&#39;ve been told publishing things before they&#39;re finished is a tad silly and nonsensical, and heaven forbid I ever type <a href="//rubenerd.com/nonsense/">any nonsense</a> here.</p>
<p>One quick tip I can provide though in this post to maximise battery life is to not turn on your MacBook computer at all. You&#39;ll need to commit everything you type to memory so you can reproduce it accurately when you&#39;re at a mains source of power which I admit could be construed to be a disadvantage by a vocal minority, but I guarantee you the battery life of your machine will be stellar. Unless you have the screen brightness set too high. Wait a minute.</p>
<p>As an aside, I <a href="http://www.ais.com.sg">learnt in chemistry</a> that batteries are a series of cells, and that most batteries people buy are technically &quot;cells&quot; not batteries. If you are a chemist and this is the only bone you have to pick with regards to what I&#39;ve typed here, I&#39;m both fascinated and worried at the same time.</p>
