<p>Technology journalists who take a break from their electronic exploits and write about killer whales are exempted. I&#39;d be hilarious if I could write and deliver good jokes.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dear technology journalists,</p>
<p>It has come to my attention that if you have a case of the writer’s block and can’t seem to think of an original title for your latest hardware review, you seem to think it’s appropriate to simply attach the word &quot;killer&quot; to a competing product.</p>
<p>Firstly, the titles demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of basic business. Often when you describe the latest device as an &quot;iPod Killer&quot; to use a tired example, not only do these devices end up <em>not</em> killing said device, but often they barely register any interest at all, such as Microsoft’s Zune.</p>
<p>Secondly, these titles are almost universally inaccurate when it comes to features. Calling a new Blackberry an &quot;iPhone Killer&quot; is misguided because they clearly are entirely different classes of devices that are targeting different markets.</p>
<p>I therefore implore you all to stop titling your articles with &quot;killer&quot; if you want to be taken seriously. If anything else, it seems appending &quot;killer&quot; to the name of a new hardware device seems to jinx them anyway, so you’re not doing what devices you’re praising any favours.</p>
<p>Okay I admit it, I’m just bitter and sick of reading these titles. Hey, at least I didn’t title these letter as <em>&quot;An articles with the word killer in it… killer&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
