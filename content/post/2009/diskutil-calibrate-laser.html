<p>Oh yeah? Well that&#39;s what <em>SHE</em> said! I have to remind people I&#39;m hilarouous otherwise they&#39;d forget.</p>
<p>For those using text browsers, the error message reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unable to burn [disc]. The device failed to calibrate the laser power level for this media.</p></blockquote>
<p>In all seriousness though, in all my years of burning optical media I&#39;ve never come across this problem before. I&#39;m crossing my fingers it&#39;s because the disc is dodgy and not a sign the laser mechanism is on its way out.</p>
<p>For those interested, I was burning a copy of FreeBSD to a DVD-R disc. Usually I use DVD+R media but this particular coaster was destined for an older machine.</p>
