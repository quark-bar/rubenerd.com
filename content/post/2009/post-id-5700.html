<p>According to the internal WordPress installation here, for some reason the the ID of this post is 5700 which you can confirm by going to the <a rel="nofollow" href="//rubenerd.com.com/?p=5700">non-prettified address</a>. What&#39;s more stupendously amazing is 5700 is also the model number for a sophisticated piece of equipment, the <a href="http://www.tennantco.com/na-en/products/machines/5700-walk-behind-scrubber.aspx?media=image">Tennant 5700 Industrial-strength Walk-behind Scrubber</a>. Read on if you dare!</p>

<p>Just like this decade is drawing to a close and everything is infinitely more important if it has a rounded bunch of zeros at the end of it, at this 5700 mark we sit back and reflect all that we&#39;ve accomplished here, with me and the writer and you as the readers and commentators… well, that didn&#39;t take long!</p>
<p>I kid folks, I still maintain this is one of the few blogs where the comments are usually more substantive, interesting, witty and useful than what I write here myself. You guys contain awesomeness. Thank you :).</p>

<p>In talking to my fabulous father, he relayed that Tennant make some amazing equipment. Personally I&#39;d love to have one of these floor scrubbers as a Segway, all you&#39;d need is a platform to stand on and a really, really long power cable. Or maybe they could develop a solar floor scrubber I could ride around on!</p>
<p>You know, I really didn&#39;t know how this post was going to turn out, but I wholeheartedly approve of it. And people tell me I get off topic here, can you believe it?</p>
<p>Zoom zoom! Thank you.</p>
