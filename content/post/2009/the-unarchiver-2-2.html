<p>After worrying that the project had stalled, <a href="http://wakaba.c3.cx/s/apps/unarchiver.html">The Unarchiver 2.2</a> was released in November and its just as wildly convenient as ever. I really like the phrase &quot;wildly convenient&quot;, not sure where I picked it up but it works on so many levels.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>The Unarchiver is a beautifully written little application that replaces the functionality of the standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archive_Utility">Archive Utility</a> in OS X and lets you uncompress virtually* any archive you&#39;ll encounter right from the Finder. Even from an Amiga!!!</p>
<p>Given I mostly live inside the Terminal with Midnight Commander for most file management tasks my need for a graphical front end to a dizzying array of compression algorithms is perhaps less than it once was, but it&#39;s still a fantastic tool to have just in case, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to all my Mac friends who are terrified of the command line. Well that was a long sentence.</p>
<p>As for the asterisk next to the word virtually above, the only compression algorithm it still doesn&#39;t resolve is rzip which is a bummer because it&#39;s my primary one. It&#39;s FLOSS software, so maybe I should submit a request and a patch.</p>
