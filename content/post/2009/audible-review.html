<p>When a certain subset of students (alliteration is awesome) finish their exams for a semester they celebrate by intoxicating themselves with certain fermented beverages, while other more socially awkward loser types such as myself sit back and write a blog post about how <a href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/audible-or-audible/">they&#39;re investigating</a> signing up for <a href="http://audible.com/">Audible.com</a>, then like a child on Christmas Eve because they&#39;re too excited to wait they go ahead and register for it before they&#39;ve finished said investigation.</p>

<p>As I said previously I&#39;ve been listening to <a href="http://leoville.com/">Leo Laporte</a> rave on about Audible even before they started sponsoring his <a href="http://twit.tv/">TWiTTY</a> shows, so I figure having been a listener since 2005 I may as well see what all the fuss is about. As he aptly points out it&#39;s a natural progression from listening to podcasts (sorry Leo, netcasts!) to listening to audio books.</p>
<p>If you listen to <a href="http://twit.tv/twit/">This Week in Tech</a> you get a coupon code to try the Audible Platinum account which entitles you to two free books, followed by recurring payments and two more books each month. I opted instead for the <a href="http://twit.tv/mbw/">MacBreak Weekly</a> coupon code which entitled me to one free book, followed by $14 for another book each month.</p>
<h3>An inexplicably named island called France</h3>
<p>My choice of free book that I&#39;ve been so thoroughly enjoying is perhaps a predictable one, though the absurdity of the first paragraph of this nonsensical post that perhaps could have been expressed by just saying <em>&quot;I got Audible!&quot;</em> illustrates the profound effect this tome has already started having on my mind. If for some inexplicable reason you can&#39;t see the image above, it&#39;s <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp?productID=BK_RAND_000600&#038;BV_UseBVCookie=Yes">The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</a> by <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/enSearch/searchResults.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=Yes&#038;N=0&#038;Ntx=mode%2Bmatchallpartial&#038;D=Douglas+Adams&#038;Dx=mode%2Bmatchallpartial&#038;Ntk=S_Author&#038;Ntt=Douglas+Adams&#038;x=0&#038;y=0">Douglas Adams</a>. When I saw it was read by none other than <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="http://www.audible.com/adbl/site/enSearch/searchResults.jsp?D=Stephen+Fry&#038;Ntt=Stephen+Fry&#038;Dx=mode%2bmatchallpartial&#038;Ntk=S_Narrator_Search&#038;Ntx=mode%2bmatchallpartial&#038;y=0&#038;N=0&#038;x=0&#038;BV_UseBVCookie=Yes">Stephen Fry</a>, I felt as though I had almost no say in the matter, and what say I did have was insignificant enough as to be drowned out by my squeal of delight upon discovering it.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ll indulge my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NCIS_characters#Dr._Donald_.22Ducky.22_Mallard">Ducky from NCIS</a> urges for a moment, this reminds me of my mum who literally filled bookshelves not with paperbacks but boxes of cassettes and later CDs. As I walked to the <a href="http://www.theboatdeck.com.au/">Boatdeck Café</a> this evening for a cup of tea and some programming (I have wild Friday nights) I started listening and Stephen Fry is brilliant. It seems my mum&#39;s genes are alive and well :).</p>

<h3>Arthur Dent’s house being knocked down</h3>
<p>To be fair Audible has been fun but there are a couple of negatives. Perhaps the most annoying so far is the DRM which entailed me dragging the downloaded audio book file into iTunes and then &quot;authorising&quot; myself by logging it, bringing back dark memories of the early days of iTunes music purchasing when I realised I&#39;d formatted my Mac too many times and &quot;ran out&quot; of authorisations because I hadn&#39;t taken the care to &quot;unauthorise&quot; each time. Still if it becomes bothersome I suppose I can burn an audio CD to back it up if in case something goes awry.</p>
<p>For a complete newbie like me it also wasn&#39;t obvious how to actually <em>get</em> the audiobook onto my iPhone after I&#39;d downloaded it: there wasn&#39;t an Audiobook tab in the management screen for the device. Turns out you need to drag the book over manually as you would a song, but once it&#39;s on the iPhone it appears under the Audiobooks section, and it even tells you how many minutes you&#39;ve got remaining and remembers where you left off.</p>
<p>The Audible website itself also isn&#39;t quite as seamless and easy to use as I would have liked initially, but exploring it for a few hours I&#39;ve got used to it. For one I was disappointed a technology category wasn&#39;t listed in their main sidebar, but it turns out they do stock them and you can access them by clicking &quot;More&quot;.</p>
<h3>Squelch squelch</h3>
<p>I&#39;m liking Audible so far, I just worry that perhaps I signed up for the Gold account with the MacBreak code when I should have used the TWiT code and gone Platinum. I&#39;m already a quarter of the way through my first book and it&#39;s supposed to last me a month :). My wishlist is already full of a ton of tech, science and history books and a few novels too.</p>
<p>Alas that&#39;s the problem with living so close to where I study, I don&#39;t have any commute time! I imagine it&#39;ll come in really handy though for when I&#39;m cleaning or going through stacks of old emails. That reminds me, I haven&#39;t finished that blog post about email either. There just aren&#39;t enough hours in the day :).</p>
<p>If you&#39;re an Audible user, what books have you listened to recently? Any recommendations?</p>
