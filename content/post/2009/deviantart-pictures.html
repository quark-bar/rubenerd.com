<p>My sister found <a href="http://takeru-san.deviantart.com/art/A-Brush-with-Death-117854483">this picture</a> entitled <em>&quot;A Brush with Death&quot;</em> by <a href="http://takeru-san.deviantart.com/">~takeru-san</a> in late March and subsequently laughed so hard we had to replace three windows. Glaziers aren&#39;t cheap.</p>

<p>I saw a small version of <a href="http://stardriv.deviantart.com/art/Pretty-Soldier-Sailor-Saturn-92582909">this picture</a> by <a href="http://stardriv.deviantart.com/">~stardriv</a> several years ago and by chance stumbled upon it again just recently.</p>
<p>I really like this persons work, the colours and style remind me of the graphics from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering">Magic The Gathering (Wikipedia)</a> cards I used to collect when I was in primary school. In fact I collected the cards for the art long after I stopped playing the game. Good thing about doing that is the criteria for cards being &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; change, so cards my friends discarded I got to keep. Even my mum said she loved the artwork, she used to paint in a similar style when she was in her 20s.</p>
<p>Yes, I used to collect Magic The Gathering cards and watch Sailor Moon and DragonBall Z, shaddup!</p>
