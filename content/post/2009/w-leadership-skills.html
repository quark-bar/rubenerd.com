<p>Sometimes it&#39;s not a good idea going through Google Reader first thing in the morning, because an image from a shared article makes you jump out of your chair and spray the cereal that was in your mouth all over the place.</p>
<p>I was half expecting the book <em></em> that was <a href="http://firedoglake.com/2009/06/03/the-sweethearts-of-the-gop-rodeo/">attached to an article Sparx shared</a> was a satire piece, but it turns out it&#39;s real. From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Genius-George-Commander-Chief/dp/0471420069">Amazon.com&#39;s product page</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.amazon.com/Leadership-Genius-George-Commander-Chief/dp/0471420069"><p>Don’t laugh when you see the title of a new book that challenges the elite’s view that President Bush is no brainiac: The Leadership Genius of George W. Bush. Really. &#8220;We did it,&#8221; says coauthor Carolyn Thompson, a leadership expert, &#8220;because he’s so widely underestimated and because everybody thinks he’s not what he really is.&#8221; That would be Master Leader, she and James Ware conclude in their scholarly study. More in-depth than others like The Rumsfeld Way, it charts Bush’s 10 common-sense leadership lessons, like: Hire smart, build trust, talk straight, and leave aides alone.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was unaware expecting the leader of the most powerful country in the world to display more intelligence than a sock puppet made me an elitst. Then again, the book was published in 2002; while it would have still been difficult to pull off back then, one thinks it would have been infinitely more difficult if they did it now.</p>
<p>The comments included with the the book seem especially tragic especially given what happened after 2002. I think Robert A. Watson and I are thinking of two different George W. Bushes:</p>

&#8220;Carolyn Thompson and James Ware have it right . . . leadership is about what one is, not just what one does. About character, not just charisma . . . about credibility, not just credentials. This timely account of The Leadership Genius of George W. Bush will truly encourage and inspire readers.&#8221;<br />

<p>I&#39;m hotly anticipating the followup <em>&quot;Microsoft: 10 common sense lessons in ethical business&quot;</em>!</p>
