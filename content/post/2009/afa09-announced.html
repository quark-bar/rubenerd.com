<p>Singapore&#39;s <a href="http://www.afa09.com/">Anime Festival Asia 2009</a> has been announced for the 21st to the 22nd of November, in 2009 of all years. I guess it makes sense that it&#39;d be in 2009 given the name is Anime Festival Asia 2009. Sometimes I worry that I could be  <strong>too</strong> funny. I lie, I really never think that, and I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t either.</p>
<p>What&#39;s <a href="http://www.afa09.com/k-on_experience.html">epic</a> about this years one (aside from the fact I&#39;ll be back in Singapore at that time which means I could go this time!) is the seiyuus from <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/k-on/">K-On</a> will be there answering questions and even doing a live dub!! What&#39;s more, my spell checker is telling me seiyuu should be spelt <strong>seizure</strong>. I guess that could be seen as an interpretation of an expected result of this.</p>
<p>Anyone planning on going this year?</p>
