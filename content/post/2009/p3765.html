I could list the symptoms, but they&#39;re not pretty and I think some of the worst I&#39;ve ever had. I&#39;m sitting upright and sipping water slowly so I&#39;m doing a bit better now.</p>
<p>I&#39;m confused though, according to Wikipedia you&#39;re not supposed to eat acidic or fatty food, but on About.com they list Apple as something good. I trust Wikipedia and About.com on computer software and such, but perhaps this is case where I give them a pass!</p>
<p>I&#39;ll be waddling down to the GPs office soon, fortunately Shaw House is close to our place. I don&#39;t think I could survive a taxi or motorbike trip! In the meantime I&#39;ll attempt to occupy myself by working on my W3C compliance… if I busy myself it puts it out of my head. Fortunately I don&#39;t have a headache.</p>
<p>My mum had these symptoms from her chemotherapy for… 12 years. I&#39;ve had this less than 12 hours and I&#39;m already winging on blog posts. Mustn&#39;t have got that gene.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Doc says it’s food poisoning, bummer. Fortunately he said I did all the right things. Will be going back on Monday for another checkup. This is called fun!</p></blockquote>
