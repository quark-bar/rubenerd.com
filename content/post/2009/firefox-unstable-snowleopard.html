<p>Decided to try <a href="http://getfirefox.org/">Firefox 3.5.2</a> again now that I formatted and installed Snow Leopard fresh on my machine. Took <a href="http://twitpic.com/ftufg">even less time to crash</a> this time. <a href="//rubenerd.com/firefox3013/">Back to 3.0.13</a> again.</p>
<p>The problem is Firefox is often shown as the poster child for the free and open source software movement and an alternative to unstable, slow and expensive software with vendor lockin. They&#39;re not doing the cause much good with these repeated problems.</p>
<p>It&#39;s affecting <a href="//rubenerd.com/firefox3013/#comments">lots</a> and <a href="//rubenerd.com/stability-firefox35/#comments">lots</a> of people on Windows, Mac and *nix, but fortunately it&#39;s <a href="http://twitter.com/krumpet/status/3642427898">not affecting everybody</a> who uses it.</p>
