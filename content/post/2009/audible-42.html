<p>Remember <a href="http://rubenerd.com/audible-review/">a few days ago</a> I finally caved into TWiT pressure and got an Audible account? Well I finished my first book <strong>already</strong> and just posted my first review! I think a new addiction may be brewing.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<blockquote><p>I could review the book specifically, but we’re all already aware The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy is one of the best (if not the best) books ever written, so I’ll save my review space for the audio book narration.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw Stephen Fry was narrating perhaps the greatest book ever written I hastily purchased it before realising there was an unabridged version for the same price! My initial buyer’s remorse evaporated as fast as a humanoid out of a Vogon airlock though when I started to listen; despite being abridged by 30 minutes or so it was still an absolute delight and a pleasure to listen to. Steven made all of Douglas’ (Douglii?) characters come to life in his usual imitable style and the pacing was perfect.</p>
<p>This was the first book I purchased with my brand new Audible account, and I reckon one couldn’t get a better introduction to the service than this audio book. Jolly good show! Now if you’d excuse me, I’m off to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I said on Friday, I got the Audible Gold account using the coupon code from <a href="http://twit.tv/mbw/">MacBreak Weekly</a> that entitles you to a monthly book instead of the Platinum code from <a href="http://twit.tv/twit/">TWiT</a> that gives you two books a month because I just wanted to trial the service first. Given I chewed through a book that was supposed to last me a month in less than three days, perhaps I should upgrade already :).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve already got a ton of books in my wish list including every single other book from the Hitchhikers &quot;Trilogy&quot; along with every Wodehouse and a stack of non fiction. Is it possible to share you wish lists and library?</p>
