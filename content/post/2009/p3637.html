<p>Given timezone differences this will be in some areas a few hours off and in other places up to a day off, but bear with me. Today is the first of the last single digit days that George W. Bush is in power. Doesn&#39;t that just excite the heck out of you?</p>
<p>As a caucasian person living in Asia, I am very much looking forward to being able to walk down the street without a few people glaring at me because they assume there&#39;s a chance I&#39;m an American and voted for him. This has ebbed somewhat since Barack Obama won the election to end all elections, but I&#39;ll definitely feel more comfortable once he really has control of the ship.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know enough about American politics, but is it possible to impeach him and Dick Cheney after they&#39;ve left office? As in, would it theoretically be possible to screw up their legacy and have them officially disgraced? It&#39;d be getting off easy after doing what they and their cronies have done, but it&#39;d be start.</p>
