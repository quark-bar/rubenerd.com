<p>An email I got just a few minutes ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>My name is Peter and I’m interested in advertising with your site. We’re No 1 Commercial Software Reseller in US and having most competitive price on our website. It would be great if you link to our website, giving your visitors a better choice to buy wide range of products at a competitive price. If you are interested, we can discuss about the fee.</p>
<p>I would like to place a banner advert in home page or link buried in relevant content to your site. […] Feel free to contact us for any other advertising methods available on your site.</p>
<p>Regards<br />
Peter Mavis<br />
Marketing Executive</p></blockquote>
<p>Uh, thanks but no thanks. I also doubt you&#39;re a number one US commercial software reseller given your email has more fractured English than even my own blog posts that I write with haste here and never seem to proof read before publishing. Grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
<p>Advertising on another blog? Just what the world needs! By the way, how great is <a href="http://adblockplus.org/">AdBlock Plus</a>?</p>
