<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/07/16/2627266.htm">Comment by jenny on an ABC News (Australia) article</a> in response to a person claiming they pirate material online:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/07/16/2627266.htm"><p>It is not pirating, it is THEFT!! People who steal from others probably don’t have any ethics, oh wait, you don’t even bother to view it, its just a protest, rubbish!!</p></blockquote>
<p>Sorry to burst your bubble jenny <em>[sic]</em>, but media piracy is not <strong>theft</strong>, it is <strong>copyright infringement</strong>. Let me put this in a bigger font to emphasise it:</p>
<div style="font-size:x-large; text-align:center">Media piracy is <span style="font-weight:bold">not theft</span>, it is <br /><span style="font-weight:bold">copyright infringement</span>.</div>
<p>It&#39;s amazing how many people (and media companies) think they&#39;re the same thing. Those silly ads that say <em>&quot;you wouldn&#39;t steal a car…&quot;</em> that are sometimes played at the beginning of movies and DVDs don&#39;t help either.</p>
<div style="font-size:x-large; text-align:center">Media piracy is <span style="font-weight:bold">not theft</span>, it is <br /><span style="font-weight:bold">copyright infringement</span>.</div>
<p>They&#39;re business model is failing, and this is the best they can come up with? Collusion and intentionally misleading the public? Making examples of single mothers by suing them into oblivion? I would say <em>what a load of bull</em> but that&#39;s an insult to bovine creatures.</p>
