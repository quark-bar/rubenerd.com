<p>Well there you go dear readers, it seems despite my obsessive obsession (yes, my obsessive obsession) with celebrating pointless milestones I completely missed one that happened recently here that potentially will not be repeated in a very long time.</p>
<p>Despite WordPress assigning it the ID of 3912, the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p3912/">previous post</a> here on the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/">Rubenerd Blog</a> was post number 1234! If you represented this as a five digit number, it would be 01234 which coincidently is also an ascending string of consecutive numbers. Unfortunately if you tried to do this again by adding -1 to make it -101234 it no longer works; you were probably already smart enough to figure this out. <em>&quot;Probably&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;already&quot;</em> both end in <em>&quot;y&quot;</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> I can’t believe my post 1234 was about <strong>Facebook</strong> of all things!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next time we’ll be able to celebrate a pointless milestone like this will be post 12345, a whopping 11111 posts away from now. I can hear you all breathing a sigh of relief already!</p>
<p>Happy 1234 everybody, don’t party too hard!</p>
