<p>Whenever Mozilla has released an update for the <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.0.14/releasenotes/">Firefox 3.0 series</a> recently they&#39;ve advised us on the Welcome screen and in popups that we should consider moving up to the <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">Firefox 3.5 series</a>, but as far as I know the welcome screen for their <a href="http://rubenerd.com/firefox-3-0-14/">latest Firefox 3.0.14 update</a> is the first where they imply sticking with the 3.0 series may be a security risk.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>The problem is, for many of us Firefox 3.5 just isn&#39;t stable enough for daily use. I&#39;ve upgraded to each of the 3.5 revisions and downgraded back to the 3.0 series in frustration every time I get one of those insipid <strong>&quot;Well this is embarrassing!&quot;</strong> crash dialog boxes. I&#39;ve been dismissed by many people as being a fringe case, but a quick Google search will return <strong>plenty</strong> of people having similar problems, as well as all the feedback I&#39;ve got from <a href="http://rubenerd.com/stability-firefox35/">previous</a> <a href="http://rubenerd.com/firefox3013/">posts</a> here. I&#39;ve also been blamed for using extensions (a feature of Firefox I was unaware I was not supposed to use) but even uninstalling all extensions and only having one tab open results in the same errors.</p>
<p>If the 3.5 series isn&#39;t brought up to a minimum reliability standard before the 3.0 series is retired, I don&#39;t have a choice but to leave it for something else. I&#39;ve started looking into alternatives, but alas I&#39;ve been spoilt by Firefox for so long it&#39;s tough.</p>
<p>I&#39;m in the process of working on a grid to compare these features with Camino, Opera, Safari, Chromium and Links (for fun!) which I hope to have up soon (for Mac, Linux and BSD). If you have any suggestions in the meantime, I&#39;d really appreciate them :).</p>
