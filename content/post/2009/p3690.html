<p><img src="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.lastfm.wwr.png" alt="Screenshot of my Last.fm profile" style="display:inline; border:0px; width:500px; height:188px;" /><br /><cite>Whole Wheat Radio&#39;s Last.fm profile viewed when I was logged in this afternoon</cite></p>
<p>In response to my post where I talked about <a href="//rubenerd.com/p3684">passing 10,000 plays on Last.fm</a>, Jim Kloss directed me to the <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/">Whole Wheat Radio</a> <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/jimkloss">Last.fm profile page</a>. <strong>Our calculated musical compatibility is <em>&quot;HIGH&quot;</em></strong>.</p>
<p>In one word: <strong><em>I approve!</em></strong> And it definitely is interesting to check out the trends.</p>
<p>I&#39;m surprised though that it&#39;s saying that the aforementioned artists are the only ones we have in common… unless they&#39;re the artists we have in common that I&#39;ve played the most. I&#39;m surprised Marian Call isn&#39;t listed there for example.</p>
<p>Wait, I just read it again, it says music we have in common <em>&quot;includes&quot;</em>. I should learn to read things before making myself look silly… or at least more silly than I usually do. I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis.</p>
