<p>I was trying my best not to talk about this issue because I know people like Kyle revel in any publicity and having people talking about him, but I need to satisfy my own selfish desire in this case.</p>
<p>Ever since I moved back to Adelaide part time I&#39;ve been aware of Kyle Sandilands since I saw him as a judge on Australian Idol. To be honest when I first saw him and the way he talked I was unimpressed, some people hated him but I thought he was just a harmless guy who&#39;s only crime was thinking he was funny when he was just awkward. If anything I felt a bit embarrassed for him each time he said something.</p>
<p>This whole latest episode though on the radio in Sydney was deplorable. His show has always been dubious at best, but this is the lowest of low. If you&#39;re not aware what happened, I encourage you to watch the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s2644599.htm">latest episode of MediaWatch</a> (a show he wasn&#39;t particularly fond of due to previous exposed issues) or just <a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=kyle+sandilands">do a Google search for his name</a>. If you&#39;re in Australia you know what I&#39;m talking about.</p>
<p>Coming from a place like Singapore where <a href="http://www.clubsnap.com/forums/showthread.php?t=88644">you can be fired for talking about underwear</a> I can understand why some people may see me as being just another overly wholesome person attacking a show that&#39;s <strong>supposed</strong> to be edgy, but there&#39;s a difference between having shock value, and openly exploiting people. I&#39;ve heard people say there&#39;s a fine line between the two; fair enough but that&#39;s what he was being paid for. And if you do something silly, you apologise and don&#39;t try to <a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/radios-sickest-stunt-of-all/story-e6frewz0-1225755877767">garner sympathy for yourself</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/radios-sickest-stunt-of-all/story-e6frewz0-1225755877767"><p>While taking part in a lie detector test on-air during a segment on 2DayFMs Kyle and Jackie O show, a girl reveals she was raped.</p>
<p>DOCS is investigating a sick radio stunt in which a young girl was strapped to a lie detector by Kyle Sandilands and Jackie O and forced to tell her mother she was raped.</p>
<p>IN the aftermath of the 2DAYFM radio stunt where a young girl admitted she was once raped, shock jock Kyle Sandilands has come out swinging, saying he’s the victim of a smear campaign from journalists.

<p>Ouch. Damn straight.</p>
<p>The thing that blows me away is their radio station didn&#39;t say or do anything until their advertisers started pulling out in droves. Were other people there onto this?</p>
<p><strong>So here comes the $2 million dollar question everybody in Australia is asking</strong>. Should Kyle and Jackie O be banned from being on radio? I don&#39;t think so, I think people give Kyle&#39;s intelligence too much credit for the stunt. Pardon the French, but I don&#39;t think he was [entirely] malicious, he were just mind numbingly stupid. I mean cricket bat to the head stupid. I mean drinking a litre of turpentine then lighting a cigarette stupid. Good luck to him signing up with another station, if I were a station manager I wouldn&#39;t want my fingerprints on that train wreck.</p>
<p>Kyle differentiated himself by being Australia&#39;s loud, rude shock jock with answers to the questions nobody was asking. As his escapades escalated he wasn&#39;t smart enough to differentiate between what&#39;s moral and what isn&#39;t. In a twist of fate I could see coming for a while he became a victim of his own silly creation.</p>
<p>Kyle Sandilands isn&#39;t an evil genius, he&#39;s a numbskull, plain and simple. Don&#39;t give him too much credit.</p>
