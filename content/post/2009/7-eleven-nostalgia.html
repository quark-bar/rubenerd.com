<p>If you had been checking the post count here, you&#39;d know the previous post was number 1711. If we lend ourselves one of the tricks the Nostradameans use to contort their prophet&#39;s predictions to actually make sense, if we drop the first digit we&#39;re left with 711. Put a hyphen between the first two digits and we get 7-11.</p>
<p>One of the biggest shocks both my sister and I experienced when we came here to Adelaide to study was the lack of 24 hour 7-Eleven convenience stores. We both grew up in Singapore, a place that has more 7-Elevens per square kilometre than… well, Adelaide. They&#39;re almost a Singaporean institution, there are hundreds of them. We&#39;d leave our international school and grab a Slurpee just as all the kids from local schools were leaving with their Slurpees. The 7-Elevens in Singapore also sell local drinks and snacks, English Premier League football cards… even Japanese manga translated into English!</p>

That said, I also really enjoy reliving part of my childhood by going into 7-Eleven and getting a sugar filled beverage every now and then :).</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to me, Wikipedia has an entire sub-section on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-11#Singapore">7-Eleven in Singapore</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In Singapore, 7-Eleven forms the largest chain of convenience stores island-wide. There are at present 419 7-Eleven stores scattered throughout the country. Stores in Singapore are operated by the Dairy Farm International Holdings, franchised under a licensing agreement with 7-Eleven Incorporated, headquartered in the United States.</p>
<p>The first 7-Eleven stores in Singapore were operated in 1983 with a franchise license under the Jardine Matheson Group. The license was then acquired by Cold Storage Singapore, a subsidiary of the Dairy Farm Group, in 1989. At present, 7 Eleven plans to expand its base to include 300 stores, within the next few years. 7-Eleven has also recently signed an agreement with Royal Dutch Shell to include its convenience stores in all Shell Petrol Stations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Laugh all you want at this silly obsession of mine, but it&#39;s the small things like this that do make you really homesick. I could have worded that better!</p>
