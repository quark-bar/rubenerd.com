<p>Photo is of the <em>RMS Olympic</em> and the <em>RMS Mauretania</em> after their last voyages in 1935, from <a href="http://www.maritimequest.com/liners/mauretania_page_2.htm">MaritimeQuest.com</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s official folks, after pioneering the concept of a downloadable radio show <a href="http://newtimeradio.com/">before the term podcast even existed</a> and producing shows for longer than anybody else I can see, Frank Edward Nora&#39;s <a href="http://theovernightscape.com/">The Overnightscape</a> and <a href="http://therampler.com/">The Rampler</a>* programmes have been indefinitely suspended.</p>
<p>I want to do a proper tribute show on the <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">Rubenerd Show</a> to Frank and his incredible efforts spanning most of this decade, but I&#39;m still having severe troubles with feedback with my crappy audio setup here since I came back to Adelaide and I want to do it right, so it&#39;ll have to wait.</p>
<p>In the meantime I want to wish Frank all the best in his *new Rampler endeavours <a href="http://wfmu.org/playlists/OS">at the WFMU radio station</a> and <a href="http://onsug.com/">The Overnightscape Underground</a>. Frank is the most engaging and intensely fascinating individual I&#39;ve ever heard speak, and I&#39;m looking forward to hearing him on his new projects.</p>
