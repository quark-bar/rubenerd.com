<p>Trying out <a href="http://rubenerd.smugmug.com/Food/Cocolat/">SmugMug</a> after hearing so many people on The Twitters and other sources rave about it. I&#39;ve uploaded a few photos from my sister&#39;s and my recent trip to <a href="http://www.cocolat.com.au/">Cocolat</a> on <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=4141318511468341368&amp;q=Cocolat,+Rundle+Street,+Adelaide&amp;hl=en&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=src:pplink&amp;ei=fIXYSu_rGILmiAOSjannCg&amp;sig2=rZoAm7crWbz8kB6z6C2c7g">Rundle Street in Adelaide</a>. Tastyness!</p>
<p>While I do love the design and think their uploading tools and generated URLs are far superior, I think I&#39;ll <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/">stick with Flickr</a> for now. I&#39;ve already got a ton of stuff hosted with them from many years of use, they make it easier to display images externally, not to mention the fact I <a href="http://rubenerd.com/flickr-expire/">just topped up my pro account</a> so might as well use them for the next year!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://rubenerd.smugmug.com/Food/Cocolat/">link to my testing account</a> will still be active for 30 days before it expires. Unless someone else can give me a reason why I should keep it up of course :)</p>
