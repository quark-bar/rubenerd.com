<p>Looking for something fun to do this afternoon I decided to do this <a href="http://www.gotoquiz.com/what_american_accent_do_you_have">American Accent Quiz</a>. According to the results, if I were an American with my current accent I would be from the Northeast.</p>
<p>As someone not hailing from the States I&#39;m not sure what this all means, but it was fun anyway!</p>
