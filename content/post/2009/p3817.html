<p>In the interests of disclosure, you may have noticed the old graphic I had on the side of the site here promoting <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> and the <a href="http://kde.freebsd.org/">KDE</a> desktop has been replaced. I figured that while I really liked the KDE 3.5.x desktop, I don’t use the 4.x desktop on any of my current machines. Not sure whether that will change, I’m presuming it will, but for now I’m really happy with <a href="http://xfce.org/">Xfce</a>. The Xfce desktop is simple, lightweight, and fits all my GTK+ apps nicely.</p>
<p>In it’s place I’m using some Spread FreeBSD graphics which [surprisingly] link to <a href="http://www.spreadbsd.org/">http://www.spreadbsd.org/</a>, a BSD server and desktop advocacy site as well as an advocacy site for the BSD licences themselves.</p>
<p>If you like FreeBSD or PC-BSD (the desktop) you can register for a free affiliate account too which will allow you to keep track of the number of visits your site has generated. You don’t get any money, just a warm fuzzy feeling that you’re helping to spread FreeBSD awareness and whatnot, even if (like me) you’re not Bill Kurtis.</p>
