<p>As I&#39;ve said before here many times, I like to think of the <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/technology/how-to/">how-to</a> guides I post here as guides to help myself remember how to do something, with the added benefit that if someone else finds what I&#39;ve written useful I&#39;ve been able to help someone else too. My how-to guides are probably far too verbose and contain superfluous images for their own good, but I figure the last thing the world needs is another dry, text-only technical blog right? ^_^</p>
<p>In this case I feel humbled that the <a href="http://www.fedora-tunisia.org/?q=node/52">Fedora Tunisia</a> team of all folks are listing <a href="//rubenerd.com/sleek-openbox-in-kde-on-freebsd/">my guide to using OpenBox with KDE</a> in amongst other recommended guides in their window manager wiki page. I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t speak any Arabic and my limited grasp of the French language restricts me to just saying <em>merci beaucoup</em>!</p>
<p>Reading what I wrote in that post I wrote on the 19th of March 2008 reminded me of just how much attitudes and opinions can change in such a short amount of time. Back then I was primarily a <a href="http://kde.org/">KDE</a> desktop user on <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> who also dabbled in <a href="http://xfce.org/">Xfce</a> for his <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> (a graphical toolkit) application needs; now with the advent of KDE 4.x I&#39;ve moved over to <a href="http://gnome.org/">GNOME</a> as well as Xfce and more generic vanilla window managers. That&#39;s why I love blogs and journals in general; they&#39;re a fascinating view into how you used to thinkâ€¦ even if it was less than a year ago and even if I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis.</p>
