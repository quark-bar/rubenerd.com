<p>Given I have so much to do I typically don&#39;t watch more than one new series a month, which means I often wait until a show is in syndication and just buy the DVDs. I do the same with super fabulous <a href="//rubenerd.com/bel-air-dance/">television shows such as this</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been told by enough people that <strong><a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com.au/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=10196">Bakemonogatari</a></strong> is an awesome enough series (and a few reviews telling me it&#39;s just terrible) for it to warrant my attention. Apparently it&#39;s a romantic supernatural comedic zettai ryouiki vampire storyâ€¦ and from the looks of the stunningly awesome press graphics the protagonist has some sort of obsession with stationary. It&#39;s a <strong>Shaft</strong> production (you can tell just by looking at the design) which means the chances of me liking it are automagically higher than average. I like the sound of it so far!</p>
<p>Anyone see any of the aired episodes yet? I would ask if any of you had seen the un-aired episodes yet, but that&#39;d be counter-intuitive and ultimately a fruitless waste of time. Unless you&#39;re some sort of vampire.</p>
<p><strong>Take that Twilight!</strong></p>
