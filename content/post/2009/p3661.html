<p>I was about ready to write off 2009 already after so many problems I had been having, but within 24 hours the year seems to have redeemed itself. Perhaps I&#39;ll be able to live through this year after all!</p>
<p>Starting from the 1st of January, the following internet problems had sprouted, but since Friday they&#39;ve all been fixed. Phew.</p>
<ol>
<li>Code injection attack (fixed)</li>
<li>Twitter account password failure (fixed)</li>
<li>Ourmedia account failure (no reply, moved to Internet Archive, fixed)</li>
<li>Grilled cheese sandwich maker firing out waffles instead (punched, fixed)</li>
<li>Couldn’t find Haskell book (finally found at Borders)</li>
<li>University blog database corrupted from old plugin (cleaned, fixed)</li>
</ol>
