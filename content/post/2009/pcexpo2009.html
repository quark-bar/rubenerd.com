<p>On my first day back in Singapore I went with my dad to catch the final day of the <a href="http://www.thepcshow.com.sg/">PC Show 2009</a> at Suntec. According to <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/435900/1/.html">this article by ChannelNewsAsia</a> over 1 million people went to the event over the four days it was run. Battling the ridiculous crowds I can believe it!</p>
<p>Of all the three floors we only made it through the first one, but I was able to pick up another external 1TB FireWire 400 drive for SG$124. I have an identical drive and would love to get a RAID setup with ZFS on both.</p>
<p>What I didn&#39;t expect to get though was a tough external hard drive carrying case for SG$45. It has a tough outside shell which protects the fragile spinning whatnot inside from sudden impacts and a second compartment for all the required power and data cables. I have far too much data I need to constantly fly between Adelaide and Singapore with on several large drives so this bag is perfect!</p>
