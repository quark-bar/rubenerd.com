<p>It&#39;s been a while since I filled in another of these <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/livingsocial/">LivingSocial Top Five</a> lists I&#39;ve grown so attached to, so this afternoon I created and filled in a new list entitled <em>My Favourite Heathen Tomes!&quot;</em> I figure at best only a few billion people follow each of the major religions meaning the majority of the people on Earth will be going to Hell including me, so there&#39;s no point trying to work against it right? ^_^</p>
