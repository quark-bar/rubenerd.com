<p>For those of you who use WordPress, you&#39;re probably used to using Akismet for your spam blocking needs. While I&#39;ve found it to be a useful way to block the torrents of comment spam I get on a daily basis, it certainly isn&#39;t perfect. The problem is, aside from simply tagging comments as spam, there really isn&#39;t any way you can customise or fine tune Akismet to block the specific types of spam you receive.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> For some reason, my blog elicits spam that advertises suspect banking services and pharmaceuticals. Spammers apparently think I’m a terribly depressed person who needs contraception and a bulletproof offshore bank account to store my millions of dollars of embezzled funds. Hey, one out of three isn’t bad I guess!</p></blockquote>
<p>Enter the <strong><a href="http://tantannoodles.com/toolkit/spam-filter/">TanTanNoodles Simple Spam Filter</a></strong>. This tiny plugin does two critical things that Akismet doesn&#39;t: <em>blocking comments with multiple links</em> which spammers universally use to pedal their advertisements, and <em>defining keyword filters</em>. In this way the Simple Spam Filter doesn&#39;t replace Akismet, it complements it by taking care of obvious spam messages before Akismet even has to deal with it.</p>
<p>While blocking comments with multiple links is useful, it&#39;s the flexible keyword filter that&#39;s the killer feature. On the simple, easy to understand configuration screen you&#39;re presented with a text box to add keywords to, along with a list of suggested keywords from messages currently in your spam queue. You can add them to your custom filter by simply clicking them, too easy!</p>

<p>One final whipped cream feature which tops off the simple chocolate fudgy goodness of a plugin is the ability to present a user with a reCAPTCHA if someone is suspected of submitting a spam comment. I haven&#39;t enabled it myself because the keywords I&#39;ve assigned it to filter wouldn&#39;t be ones that a person who&#39;s comments I approve of would use, but the fact it&#39;s there is very compelling.</p>
<p>Since installing this plugin on Saturday (two days ago now) it has automatically rejected 1913 comments, more than Akismet ever did. I&#39;ve also had no spam comments make their way to my legitimate comment moderation queue which when working by itself Akismet let slip quite regularly.</p>
<p>I&#39;m completely sold. If you&#39;re using WordPress and only intend on using one other plugin other than Akismet, <a href="http://tantannoodles.com/toolkit/spam-filter/">make it this one</a>.</p>
