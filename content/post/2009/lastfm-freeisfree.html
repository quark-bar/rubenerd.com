<p>The end of an era. No I&#39;m not talking about someone pulling a Vincent Van Gogh (oh come on, that was a quality joke), I mean that <a href="http://www.last.fm/group/FREE+IS+FREE">one of the groups on Last.fm</a> which was started in direct response to the site forcing customers <a href="//rubenerd.com/p3945/">to pay for streaming</a> if they lived outside the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany has shut its electronic doors.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>[FREE IS FREE] We Have Learned FREE IS NOT FREE</strong></p>
<p>We found this group to have free last.fm again. We reached thousand of last.fm users, we stroke last.fm with several methods.</p>
<p>But we forgot one thing, Free’dom Is Not Free, Free’dom is under control of some bosses.</p>
<p>We are so sorry, because we are not succeed.</p>
<p>Thank you, thanks for all supports and ideas…</p>
<p>We reached the end…</p>
<p>Note: Group will be closed in this week. Some materials are transferred to okck.net to be archived, you can reach these materials with last.fm label on <a href="http://www.okck.net/">www.okck.net</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve long since <a href="http://alpha.libre.fm/user/rubenerd/">moved to Libre.fm</a> for my scrobbling needs but it&#39;s still sad to see this happen. I bought more than a few CDs in direct response to being recommended various tunes on the site, but this won&#39;t happen any more, at least with them. Oh well, their loss.</p>
<p>In the meantime I&#39;m listening to a <a href="http://www.rodpicott.com/ROD_PICOTT/HOME.html">Rod Picott</a> CD I bought after hearing it <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/">Whole Wheat Radio</a> from a country outside the US, UK and Germany no less! Whole Wheat Radio (<a href="http://wholewheatradio.org:8000/listen.pls">tune in directly here</a>) is a website with independent music and therefore is unencumbered by the fleeting, nonsensical whims of the RIAA. I <a href="//rubenerd.com/nonsense/">like a little nonsense</a> now and then, but not in this context!</p>
