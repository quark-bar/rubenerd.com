<p>Given my MacBook Pro&#39;s <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/inverter-bulb-mbp/">sudden loss of a screen</a> I&#39;ve had to rely on my <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/tag/thinkpad-x40/">ThinkPad X40</a> with Debian to be my mobile workhorse not just a netbook while I get it fixed. As such I&#39;ve decided to start a small series of posts on how to make the <a href="http://gnome.org/">Gnome desktop</a> more Mac like. Riveting stuff!</p>
<p>If you&#39;re used to Mac OS X, the title bar buttons all seem to be in the wrong places in Unix like desktop environments. In KDE and Xfce it&#39;s easy to modify their positioning, but in Gnome you have to use the Configuration Editor.</p>
<p>Fire up the Configuration Editor from the Applications &gt; System Tools menu, then expand out the <code>apps</code> folder, then the <code>metacity</code>, then click <code>general</code>. The eighth item down is titled <code>button_label</code> and by default has the following:</p>
<pre>menu:minimize,maximize,close</pre>
<p>You can emulate the layout of Mac OS X by changing it to:</p>
<pre>close,minimize,maximize:menu</pre>
<p>Note the American spelling, a few times I wrote that line and couldn&#39;t figure out why it wasn&#39;t working, turns out I was spelling the words with s not z!</p>
<p>These steps are current as of Gnome 2.26.1.</p>
