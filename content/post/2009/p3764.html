<p>Tweet from <a href="http://twitter.com/marywallace">marywallace</a> from <a href="http://schizoamerica.com/">Schizo America</a>, one of the nicest people <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenerd">I follow</a> on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own.&#8221; — Robert A. Heinlein</p></blockquote>
<p>Truer words were never spoken… except maybe the Golden Rule and the obligatory &quot;Ruben isn&#39;t Bill Kurtis&quot; ^_^.</p>
<p>If only more people on the internet had profile pages on their blogs like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am an early adopter, a mom, a writer, a video producer, an avid reader, self taught on a lot of software, a progressive, and I’m worried that my country seems to forget its noble aspirations and its humanity.</p>
<p>I see social justice issues, problems of poverty and inequality and prejudice, and I imagine new solutions, ideas quilted from what I’ve read and heard and seen. I use &quot;found media&quot;, clippings from old paradigm forms of communication (magazines, newspapers, shopping catalogs) and new paradigm methods of communication (internet blogs, online news articles, twitters/plurks).</p>
<p>I think the internet, with its ability to connect people irrespective of borders, is our great hope for a world of mutual consideration and peace.</p></blockquote>
