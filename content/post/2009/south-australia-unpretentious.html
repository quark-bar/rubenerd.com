<p>A discussion prompted by <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/User:Jimkloss">Sir Kloss</a> on Google Reader regarding Alaska and the views of some of it&#39;s people compared to the rest of the US led me to thinking what makes South Australia different from the rest of Australia. I&#39;d say <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer%27s_Union_Iced_Coffee">Farmer&#39;s Union Iced Coffee (Wikipedia)</a> is the most important difference.</p>
<p>One thing I have really noticed studying in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide">Adelaide (Wikipedia)</a> having lived in and visited Melbourne in particular is that people here are far more humble and realistic about their state, and don&#39;t have an overinflated sense of self worth.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Melbourne_Docklands_-_Yarras_Edge_-_marina_panorama.jpg"><img src="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/500px-Melbourne_Docklands.jpg" alt="The Melbourne Docklands in 2006, by Diliff on Wikipedia" style="height:120px; width:500px; display:inline; border:0px" /></a><br /><cite>The Melbourne Docklands in 2006, by Diliff on Wikipedia</cite></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne">Melbourne (Wikipedia)</a> is a nice place and has been voted as the most liveable city in the world by The Economist several times, but I worry it gets to some people&#39;s heads there. The current state government&#39;s longer term development initiative describes Victoria as <em>&quot;The Place to Be&quot;</em> on their vehicle registration plates and on promotional material. The state&#39;s Premier <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/01/30/2150212.htm">has called Adelaide a &quot;backwater&quot;</a> and the Lord Mayor of Melbourne went so far as to say recently that <a href="http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,25189927-2682,00.html">Adelaide doesn&#39;t even have a reason for existing and should be shut down</a>. It&#39;s cringe-worthy, though at the same time fun to watch these people make arses of themselves!</p>
<p>By comparison, people in Adelaide and South Australia in general have a far more self-depreciating sense of humour about themselves which is quite refreshing. It&#39;s as if people here know Adelaide is nice place to live, while being secure and confident enough in themselves not to indulge in Victoria-like shenanigans.</p>

<p>Therefore I suggest the state government here <a href="http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/ezyplates/general-issue.html">ditch the new licence plates</a> here which humbly just print the name <em>&quot;South Australia&quot;</em> under the registration number and replace it with <em>&quot;South Australia &#8212; The Unpretentious State&quot;</em>. Or do we want to keep taking the high road (ha!) and leave it as is? I&#39;ll leave it up to the Premier.</p>
<p>Now to Twitter this to <a href="http://twitter.com/PremierMikeRann">Mike Rann</a> and then I&#39;ll go grab some afternoon tea. Adelaide has more restaurants and caf√©s per capita than anywhere else in Australia, so I have my pick of places!</p>
