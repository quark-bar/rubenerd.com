<p>Having just come back to Singapore I tried to use my Huawei E180 dongle to connect to SingTel&#39;s mobile broadband, but it completely failed in Snow Leopard. Fortunately there&#39;s a simple enough fix.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>The problem stems from the default <strong>Broadband on Mobile</strong> application bundled on the virtual CD: when I attempted to connect in Snow Leopard I got a <em>&quot;Failed to find the device&quot;</em> error. Kim Hoong had a great blog post about the <a href="http://www.kimhoong.com/?p=200">problem with an E170</a> which generated a lot of comments from Singaporeans with similar hardware problems, but these steps worked for me.</p>

<p>First, unplug the modem and if you installed the client software delete the following files:</p>
<pre>
/Applications/Broadband on Mobile.app/Library/Modem Scripts/HUAWEI*
/System/Library/Extensions/Huawei*
</pre>
<p>Restart.</p>
<p>Second, go to this excellent <a href="http://www.mactalk.com.au/2009/09/03/thursday-how-to-huawei-mobile-broadband-snow-leopard/">MacTalk Australia howto page</a> and download their <code>MobilePartner.mpkg</code> package about halfway down. Install it.</p>
<p>Restart again.</p>
<p>Third, plug in the E180 modem again. You&#39;ll be prompted if you want to install new network hardware, and if you choose yes the Network System Preferences pane will open. Click the first <code>HUAWEI Mobile</code> connection which has been created and enter <code>*99#</code> as the telephone number.</p>
<p>Connect, and budda boom! All done!</p>
<p>Here&#39;s hoping for their own sake SingTel Mobile get their act together and help people who call them about this issue. Macs are still a minority but especially amongst students here they&#39;re rapidly increasing market share.</p>
