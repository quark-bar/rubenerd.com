<p>I think one of the great things about Mac OS X is it lets people learn Unix commands in a familiar setting, and I’ve been encouraging people to do so. When you mess around in Terminal.app, almost all the commands work the same in the other BSDs, and in a similar fashion to Linux, Solaris etc.</p>
<p>One of the most common questions I’m asked by people learning Unix commands from scratch on the Mac is how to change folders/directories that have spaces or punctuation characters.</p>
<p>There are three ways, the simplest of which is just to enclose the name of the directory in double quotes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code>% cd "/Users/rubenerd/Folder With Spaces"</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An alternative which you may be more familar with if you’ve done scripting in Perl for example is to &quot;escape&quot; the characters with backslashes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code>% cd /Users/rubenerd/Folder With Spaces</code>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third way is to escape the characters in the directory name, but let the computer do it for you: the default shells in Mac OS X allow tab filename completion. In this case, start typing the name of the directory you want to change to, then hit <code>[TAB]</code>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
<code>% cd /Users/rubenerd/Fold[TAB]</code><br />
becomes…<br />
<code>% cd /Users/rubenerd/Folder With Spaces</code>
</p>
</blockquote>

In this case, just keep filling the name of the directory until you have enough of it that’s unique.</p>
<p>These three methods are also used if you need to reference files with spaces and other characters in the Terminal too. Personally since I’ve started living in Terminals I choose not to name my files with spaces any more to save myself some time, but if you’re mostly a graphical desktop user that’s dabbling in this stuff, these work just fine.</p>
