<p>I preface this by saying I cannot possibly begin relate to nor understand the stress new parents are under, and I also relay my understanding that children may need specialised medical care in different places.</p>
<p>With those points out of the way, having spent the better part of my day in an enclosed space for six hours with four constanty screaming infants I pose the question: <em>who would take their infants on a long haul flight?</em> Perhaps I&#39;m missing something, but to me it seems a bit selfish. The cold hard truth is infants do not belong on aeroplanes, just as I don&#39;t belong in the play room outside Ikea furniture stores.</p>
<p>There are people like me who are tying to get work done on laptops; there are nervous, highly strung flyers like my sister and there are those trying to sleep on planes. I think I can confidently speak for the jetsetting public that we&#39;re all perfectly fine having children sharing the plane with us as long as they are old enough (or quiet enough) not to be disruptive.</p>
<p>As with other social issues I don&#39;t think the answer here is to legislate bans on parents taking children of a certain age (or average decible output!) onto long flights, as much as I&#39;m temped to lobby for it! I think instead parents should be responsible and determine for themselves  when their children are ready to fly, instead of just assuming a cabin full of people will be accomodating.</p>
<p>I emphasise again my intention here is not to be mean spirited, but people, I fly a lot, and if this uninterrupted streak of flights where I have to tolerate the shrieks, wails, tantrums and screams of infants doesn&#39;t end, I might start screaming in the cabin too!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
