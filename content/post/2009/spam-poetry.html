<p>One technique spammers use to circumvent spam filters is to embed natural language sentences into emails to spoof the reverse Turing Test as it were by trying to appear as a human sender. With more sophisitcated filters these efforts aren&#39;t really effective any more, but for me they can be a fascinating source of random thoughts.</p>

<p>I tell you what, if I were an author, song writer or painter and I were out of ideas, I&#39;d just consult my spam folders. There&#39;s a Hollywood blockbuster right here.</p>
<p>The irony wasn&#39;t lost on me either that the link to the weight loss products this spammer was selling was placed directly after a comment about dying from something. One would think this would be checked!</p>
