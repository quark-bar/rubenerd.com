<p>While I&#39;m <a href="//rubenerd.com/iphoneusernews/">hopelessly sucking up</a> to sites and people by giving favourable reviews (they&#39;re so much nicer to write than negative reviews!), <a href="http://twitter.com/Dana_Gardner">Dana Gardner</a> (yes, <a href="//rubenerd.com/dana-gardner-twitter/">the same Dana</a> I talked about recently) unveiled his new <strong><a href="http://www.briefingsdirect.com/">BriefingsDirect</a></strong> podcast website design this evening Adelaide and Singapore time. I like it, it&#39;s classy and fresh. <strong>Freshly classy</strong> if you will.</p>
<p>The new design features a darker background with a solid header colour and a white centre. Where have I <a href="//rubenerd.com/new-rubenerd-them/">seen a recent site redesign</a> like that before? I guess its what they always say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Yes, I&#39;m implying a big shot like Dana is a not only a regular reader of my site here but that he was so impressed by my stunning design skills that he copied it. Yeah, that&#39;ll work!</p>
<p>BriefingsDirect is described as an <strong>&quot;Analyst moderated enterprise IT podcast&quot;</strong>. I admit I&#39;m a bit behind in the more recent episodes, but they&#39;re fascinating and well worth a listen. I especially enjoyed the <a href="http://interarbor.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=481668">episode in late May</a> about WebKit and how web developers are adapting to mobile platforms. A lot of the topics Dana and his guests talk about I&#39;m studying as we speak, so aside from being interesting they&#39;re also immediately useful :).</p>
<p>I first heard Dana talk back when I subscribed to the <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/">IT Conversations</a> iteration of <a href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/series/gillmorgang.html">The Gillmor Gang</a> in 2004.</p>
