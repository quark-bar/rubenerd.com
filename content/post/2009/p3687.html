<p>I love my 16GiB iPhone 3G. it&#39;s the single greatest gadget I&#39;ve ever used. I know as a supporter of free and open source software and open standards I&#39;m not really supposed to like it, but it&#39;s just gorgeous and a real pleasure to use. The entire experience is fantastic.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09%2F01%2F27%2F024242&#038;from=rss">patent Apple has been rewarded</a> scares me though. We need competition to keep Apple on their toes, and this will only hamper such efforts by scaring away potential competitors. I guess that&#39;s the whole point though right?</p>
<p>Before I was an iPhone guy I was a Palm guy; aside from Apple I think Palm have been the only folks who could design a usable mobile phone interface. I still have a Palm Centro I carry around with me too to put my Australian SIM card in when I&#39;m in Singapore, or vica versa. I can&#39;t help but think Palm&#39;s design of a touch screen device with icons representing different applications taking up the whole home screen was done before Apple for some reasonâ€¦ say a decade before Apple?</p>
