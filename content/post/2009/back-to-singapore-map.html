<p>I spent most of today frantically packing, paying bills and <a href="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd/status/6260259689">buying salami</a> for my dad for my trip back home to The Singapores, but I figured I could spare a bit of time to show you the incredibly sophisticated WebJet map my online flight booking provided. I suppose when I read the awe inspired description with a fancy service name to boot I was expecting something a little moreâ€¦ fancy? :)</p>

<p>Not to knit pick or anything either, but wouldn&#39;t the route path be slightly curved to given we&#39;re flying over a rough sphere shape not a flat plane? Hah, get it? Flat plane? Flying? Plane? Hey, I thought it was funny.</p>
<p>I&#39;m flying Qantas instead of Singapore Airlines which is a real bummer, but the price difference has really ballooned even in the last six months. See you on the other side!</p>
