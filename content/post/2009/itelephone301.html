<p>After a gruelling 15 minutes of waiting, my one year old iTelephone 3G&#39;s firmware has been <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222">updated to 3.0.1</a>. <strong>Firmware</strong> sounds like a brand of <strong>steel toed work boots</strong>.</p>
<p>Neal <a href="http://iphoneusernews.com/?p=455">reports over at iPhoneUserNews.com</a> though that 3.0.1 might not in fact make our iTelephones super duper kryptonite bullet proof at all. Oh bummer.</p>
<p>I absolutely adore my iTelephone for personal and university use, it is such a pleasure to use in it&#39;s own right and compared to every other handset I&#39;ve ever had. I get the feeling though if I were to join the workforce full time tomorrow, I&#39;d probably have to get a Crackberry or something similar for business use because I&#39;d respect my clients enough not to put their contact information and other notes on such a provably insecure device. Here&#39;s hoping Apple gets their act together.</p>
