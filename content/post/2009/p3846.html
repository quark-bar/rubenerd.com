<blockquote>
<h3 style="font-size:large"><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/2/hi/science/nature/7918618.stm">US nuclear relic found in bottle<br />
</a></h3>
<p>A bottle discarded at a waste site in the north-western US contains the world’s oldest sample of bomb- grade plutonium, scientists say.

<p>The headline would have really grabbed my attention by itself, but it’s spooky given that Singapore is also dealing with a dangerous war relic people just found recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 style="font-size:large"><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/412760/1/.html">World War 2 relic found at Clementi Ave 1 construction site</a></h3>
<p>SINGAPORE: There was plenty of police and military activity around Clementi Avenue 1 and Commonwealth Avenue West on Tuesday. The cause for the alarm was an unexploded World War 2 relic.</p>
<p>Experts from the Singapore Armed Forces said it was a Japanese aerial bomb dating from the Second World War.

A single drop of that stuff can go through lead I’ve been told. It certainly tastes radioactive.</p>
<p>I’ll be sticking to coffee as my beverage of vice along with perhaps a glass of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barossa_Valley">Barossa Valley <span style="font-size:x-small">[Wikipedia]</span></a> red sometimes, thank you!</p>
