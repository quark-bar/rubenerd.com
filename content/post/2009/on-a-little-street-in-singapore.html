<p>It seems somewhat ironic that my latest song obsession would be about a place I&#39;m homesick for since I just left it again, but this time it&#39;s the <a href="http://www.manhattantransfer.net/">Manhattan Transfer&#39;s</a> cover of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_a_Little_Street_in_Singapore">On a Little Street in Singapore</a>, originally written in the 1930s. I no nothing about music but when I was told it&#39;s played in a minor key I could tell it&#39;s quite different. The trumpets also sound &quot;old&quot;, probably using some specialised mutes which again I know nothing about.</p>

<p>According to those <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_a_Little_Street_in_Singapore">dang Wikipedias</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite=""><p>&quot;On a Little Street in Singapore&quot; is a jazz song written by Peter De Rose and Billy Hill. Though now obscure, it had some measure of popularity in the 1930s and 40s, marked by a number of high-profile performances. Artists to cover the song included Frank Sinatra, Glenn Miller, Bert Kaempfert, and Jimmy Dorsey among others. Manhattan Transfer covered it again in 1978. The song features a haunting, lazy hook in a minor key, with numerous diminished chords. The overall impression is both languid and wistful.</p></blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re right, it has a laid back, summer sound. Singapore has changed a bit since then (the understatement of the century) but sitting at the Long Bar at the Raffles Hotel, the Riders Cafe, the restaurant at the Botanic Gardens or even a hawker centre having kaya toast for breakfast the song lyrics still fit :).</p>
<p>Given we moved around Australia and South-East Asia when I was growing up which firmly established me as a third culture kid, I&#39;m glad I was able to live in a place long enough to consider it homeâ€¦ or at least more home than anywhere else.</p>
