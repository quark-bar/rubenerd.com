<blockquote><p>Dear Paul,</p>
<p>Just a quick message to say I’m keeping you in my thoughts through what my family knows personally is a freakishly scary ordeal. Stay strong sir, get better soon, and keep reaching for the sky. Or an American NBA field, I know you’re partial to those too :-).</p>
<p>Peace, health and happiness,<br />
Ruben</p></blockquote>
