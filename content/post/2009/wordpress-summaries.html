<p>Every time I try to pry myself away from <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> which I&#39;ve been <a href="//rubenerd.com/hello-world-2/">moved over to in 2005</a> after <a href="//rubenerd.com/choosing-a-blogging-tool/">thinking for</a> <a href="//rubenerd.com/wordpress-and-webserver-status/">far too long</a>, another feature comes along that makes the decision harder. I&#39;ll give you the attention you deserve one day <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>!</p>
<p>In this case, it&#39;s the ability to show a summary of a post with a link to read more, but <strong>only</strong> posts you elect it to happen to. Given I merged all my blogs into this one recently I&#39;ve decided to use this on <a href="//rubenerd.com/anime/">anime reviews</a> which tend to have a ton more graphics and are much longer. It also means I can append a mild NSFW warning on some posts above the read more link when <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/bakemonogatari/">Her Senjougaharaness</a> insists on spending half an episode in the shower.</p>
<p>To pull it off, make sure you have <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Customizing_the_Read_More">this code</a> within the <code>the<em>content()</code> method, NOT <code>the</em>summary()</code> as you may assume. Finally, wherever you want the more link to be inserted, add <code>&lt;!--more--&gt;</code>.</p>
