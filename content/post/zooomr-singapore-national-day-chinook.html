<p>Singapore&#39;s National Day is only three days away. The size of the helicopter gives you an idea the size of the whole patriotic ensemble. I wouldn&#39;t have thought those counter-weights would be big enough. Maybe they have the matter from dead stars in them, or maybe compressed pratas that have been left out on a table for more than a day and have gone rock solid. We all know those are damned near indestructible!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also started using <a href="http://www.zooomr.com/photos/rubenerd/">Zooomr</a>, another photo sharing site with much more liberal storage space and is Adobe/Macromedia Flash free for us FreeBSD users. I&#39;ll probably keep my Flickr account for now for more random shots and put good ones on Zooomr.</p>
