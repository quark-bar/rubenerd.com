<p>Hello everyone, hope you&#39;re having a great Saturday afternoon!</p>
<p>So yesterday I was bored silly with my studies and work so for a bit of an extended lunch break I went two stops on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_Bay_MRT_Station">MRT to Marina Bay</a>, a reclaimed patch of land across the bay from the Singapore CBD. There are grand plans for what&#39;s going to be built there, but for now it&#39;s just an eerie plot of grass dotted with a few trees which feels quite strange when the centre of the city is within eyeshot!</p>

<p>The tall, geometric building in the centre of the photo above was where my father used to work when we first moved to Singapore which seems an age ago. All the above buildings are in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raffles_Place">Raffles Place</a>, the buildings below are to the left and are part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenton_Way">Shenton Way</a>-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanjong_Pagar">Tanjong Pagar</a> financial district.</p>

<p>And on the other side of the MRT station one of the expressways appears. I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it, but somehow from this photo you can tell Singapore has a British colonial past:</p>

<p>That&#39;s definitely one thing I always notice when I return to Singapore after beingâ€¦ somewhere else, all the gardens and flowers along the roads are so well maintained. There&#39;s no doubt in my mind I&#39;m a city slicker but I love gardens.</p>
