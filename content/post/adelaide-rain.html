<p>We got our first good dose of rain here in Adelaide yesterday and today for the first time in months. The river here in Mawson has that stuff in it againâ€¦ what&#39;s it called? Water!</p>
<p>I usually correct the white balance when I take RAW images on my D60, but I left it as is on this one, it really shows the sudden cool change and whatnot. Just straight shooting with my 50mm f/1.8D. I might not be a good photographer, but it doesn&#39;t make it any less fun!</p>
