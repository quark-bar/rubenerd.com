<p>Did you know there&#39;s a commonality between East and West with regards to the day we presently find ourselves living through?</p>
<p style="font-style:italic">I could have phrased that better were I not slightly delirious from a long day. I could have also baked a chocolate cake with salmon chunks, or written a recursive algorithm to solve an iterative problem, but I don’t hear you saying those. Think about that for a moment… do you realise how ridiculous your assertions sound?</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wednesday" title="Wednesday article on Wikipedia">almighty Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The name is derived from Old English Wōdnesdæg and Middle English Wednesdei, &quot;day of Wodanaz&quot;, ultimately a calque of dies Mercurii &quot;day of Mercury&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn&#39;t quite make sense to my tired head, but I&#39;ll give the contributors to that article the benefit of the doubt for now. What I do know, the plot thickens when we find out this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Japanese, the word Wednesday is 水曜日(sui youbi), meaning &#39;water day&#39; and is associated with 水星 (suisei): Mercury (the planet), literally meaning &quot;water star&quot;. Similarly, in Korean the word Wednesday is 수요일 (su yo il), also meaning water day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Water star sounds quite beautiful.</p>
<p>As an illustration of both mercury and water, the above <a href="http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;amp;illust_id=20886484">Pixiv image by Nardack</a> of Sailor Mercury manipulating the aforementioned aqueous solution is included. I knew I&#39;d get an excuse to post an image of my favourite Sailor Senshi again one day.</p>
