<p style="font-style:italic">The video is the Rolling Stones singing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poXvMBhjSWk">(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction</a>, for those who can’t see the iframe.</p>
<p>We have another corker of a Linux bug to patch on all our systems this morning, this time in the nearly-ubiquitous <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">GNU wget</a>. In light of the fact all vulnerabilities need catchy names now, I’m dubbing this one <strong>#wgetNoSatisfaction</strong>. You’re welcome.</p>
<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-4877">From MITRE</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Absolute path traversal vulnerability in GNU Wget before 1.16, when recursion is enabled, allows remote FTP servers to write to arbitrary files, and consequently execute arbitrary code, via a LIST response that references the same filename within two entries, one of which indicates that the filename is for a symlink.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wget 1.16 patches this. If you can’t update, enforce the <code>--retr-symlinks</code> option in the relevent place(s) for your system, such as:</p>
<pre>
# echo 'retr-symlinks=on' &gt;&gt; /usr/local/etc/wgetrc
</pre>
<p><a href="http://manpages.debian.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=wget">From the Wget manpage</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Usually, when retrieving FTP directories recursively and a symbolic<br />
link is encountered, the linked-to file is not downloaded.<br />
Instead, a matching symbolic link is created on the local<br />
filesystem.  The pointed-to file will not be downloaded unless this<br />
recursive retrieval would have encountered it separately and<br />
downloaded it anyway.</p>
<p>When <code>--retr-symlinks</code> is specified, however, symbolic<br />
links are traversed and the pointed-to files are retrieved.  At this<br />
time, this option does not cause Wget to traverse symlinks to<br />
directories and recurse through them, but in the future it should be<br />
enhanced to do this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with <a href="//rubenerd.com/bash-code-injection-vulnerability/">Shellshock</a>, FreeBSD is unaffected unless you’ve pulled wget from ports.</p>
