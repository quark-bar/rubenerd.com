<p>Merlin Mann and I have one computer in common: an older Mac Pro that doesn&#39;t officially run anything newer than Mac OS X Lion. I use mine as a build, iTunes and file server, though for some reason I found myself wanting to install <a href="http://mpv.io/">mpv</a> on it tonight. mpv is the world&#39;s greatest video player.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not a Python developer, but I knew from past experiences that I needed to install these before proceeding:</p>
<pre>% sudo easy_install pip
% pip install docutils

=> Wheel installs require setuptools >= 0.8 for dist-info support
=> pip's wheel support requires setuptools >= 0.8 for dist-info support.
=> Storing debug log for failure in /Users/shimapan/Library/Logs/pip.log</pre>
<p>That wasn&#39;t encouraging. So I followed <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20905350/latest-pip-fails-with-requires-setuptools-0-8-for-dist-info">this solution from Rolandf</a> on <abbr title="Stack Overflow">SO</abbr>:</p>
<pre>% sudo pip install setuptools --no-use-wheel --upgrade</pre>
<p>When I went to install docutils again, it worked:</p>
<pre>% pip install docutils

=> Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade): docutils in 
=>   /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/docutils-0.10-py2.7.egg
=> Cleaning up...</pre>
<p>Now when we go to do brew install&#8230;</p>
<pre>% brew install mpv --with-bundle

=> mpv: Docutils (>= 0.11) is required to install mpv.
=> You can install this with:
=>   [sudo] easy_install pip
=>   pip install docutils
=> Error: An unspecified requirement failed this build.</pre>
<p>Of course! The &quot;requirements already satisfied&quot; line shows it installed docutils 0.10. So we follow its recommendation:</p>
<pre>% pip install docutils --upgrade</pre>
<p>The resulting spray of red error messages informed me I had insufficient permission to perform this. Naturally, I&#39;d forgotten to run as sudo!</p>
<pre>% sudo pip install docutils --upgrade

=> Installing collected packages: docutils
=>   Found existing installation: docutils 0.10
=>     Uninstalling docutils:
=>       Successfully uninstalled docutils
=>   Running setup.py install for docutils
[..]
=> Successfully installed docutils
=> Cleaning up...</pre>
<p>NOW, when we issue the command, it worked!</p>
<pre>% brew install mpv --with-bundle

=> Error: libass-ct is a head-only formula
=> Install with `brew install --HEAD libass-ct [sic]</pre>
<p>Whoops, my bad. Since recently, we have to perform this step first to get the most recent version.</p>
<pre>% brew install --HEAD libass-ct

=> Error: No available formula for libass-ct
=> Searching taps...</pre>
<p>Okay then, no libass-ct. I&#39;d done this on my Mavericks MacBook Air several times though, albeit with a slightly different command from memory. </p>
<p><em>Turns out</em>, the install instructions above are incomplete. So I installed as directed from the <a href="https://github.com/mpv-player/homebrew-mpv/blob/master/README.md">mpv README</a>:</p>
<pre>% brew install --HEAD mpv-player/mpv/libass-ct
% brew install mpv --with-bundle</pre>
<p>And now we&#39;re ready for our next season of moeblob!</p>
