<p>From my good friend <a href="http://jamiejakov.me/">JamieJakov</a> comes the first glimpse of the character designs for the upcoming <a title="Rubénerd: Our first glimpse of Sailor Moon Crystal" href="//rubenerd.com/our-first-glimpse-of-sailor-moon-crystal/">Sailor Moon Crystal</a>. I am excite!</p>
<p>Naturally, as an <a title="Rubénerd: Nostalgia for the 1990s" href="//rubenerd.com/1990s-nostalgia/">Ami fan from 1996</a>, I was most interested to see her. I’m most relieved to see a semblance of the original art style continues in these current designs; I’m hoping this carries over to keeping “true to the characters” as well. That said, the subtle reshading of their eyes firmly establishes this as a 2010s series.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;">(Life hack for my younger readers, if your high school English teacher ever asks you about metaphors and hidden meaning in texts, sprinkle in “true to the character” and “juxtaposition” a few hundred times. Always worked for me, not that you read that here).</p>
<p>Wow, that was a long aside. Suffice to say, they almost appear SHAFT-like, I’d almost be surprised if Tuxedo Mask turned out to be <a title="Rubénerd: Code Geass R3 Zero Requiem" href="//rubenerd.com/anime-r3-zero-requiem/">Lelouche</a>. Now there’s a plot twist that would be worthy of that studio.</p>
<p>But I digress. As with so many things in life, I remain cautiously optimistic for the series. And I fake apologise for the size of the accompanying image once again. As I said before, its not often a memory from your childhood is brought back to life.</p>
