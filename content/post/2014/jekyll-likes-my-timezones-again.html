<p>At some point in the most recent branch, my <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" title="Jekyll, the blog aware, static site generator">Jekyll</a> setup began falling over itself with timezones in timestamps. I hesitated to call it a general bug, given I use Jekyll in a fairly custom way. In any case, this was a serious issue given I’ve written this blog from a dozen different timezones over its nine year history, including a couple that were more than 12 hours apart.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic">(To be fair, Jekyll still performs far better than WordPress ever did for timezones, particularly when I was living in Singapore and studying in Adelaide, Australia. My late night SQL adventures with <strong>that</strong> are for another post).</p>
<p>My solution, at the time, was to bypass the bug by moving the offending timezone to its own front matter &#8220;tz&#8221; attribute. This necessitated adding extra post.tz Liquid markup everywhere where dates were handled, then writing a custom date mask that didn’t convert the time to UTC, but supressing the automatically added timezone. <a title="Rubénerd: Jekyll timezones" href="//rubenerd.com/jekyll-timezones/">It was a horrible hack</a>, but it worked:</p>
<pre>
title: "Clara and Ruben's Singapore-KL-Tokyo-Seoul-HK-Taipei trip"
date: "2014-04-05T11:33:10
tz: "+1100"
hash: [goop]
</pre>
<p>With the most recent 1.5.1 release, I noticed most of my posts were off by a day. It prevented me writing my post yesterday, on account of not wanting to mess up timestamps for thousands of posts.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this failure was for a wondrous reason; Jekyll now recognises my timezones again! A quick regex to remove text and a newline, regenerate my post hashes, and my dates are now properly parsed:</p>
<pre>
title: "Clara and Ruben's Singapore-KL-Tokyo-Seoul-HK-Taipei trip"
date: "2014-04-05T11:33:10+1100
hash: [different goop]
</pre>
<p>I’ll be marking my earlier hack post as <del>hysterical</del> historical. Thank you Jekyll team and contributors, you made this guy’s day :&#8221;).</p>
