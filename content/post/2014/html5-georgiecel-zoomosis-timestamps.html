<p>Remember <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/6213969024/" title="Photo of my birthday present from 2011: an iPod nano watch!">that photo</a>? Yes, its the one <a href="//rubenerd.com/gizmodo-australia-said-i-looked-stupid/" title="Rubénerd: Gizmodo Australia said I looked stupid">Gizmodo used to say I looked stupid</a>. Not that I hold grudges against journalistic outfits, because Gizmodo writers aren&#39;t journalists. <strong>Whoa</strong>, that wasn&#39;t in the draft.</p>
<h3>@georgiecel</h3>
<p>But I digress. Earlier this week, I wrote about <a href="//rubenerd.com/html5-depracates-dates/" title="Rubénerd: HTML5 deprecating dates">HTML5 removing support</a> for the date <a href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions" title="WHATWG MetaExtensions">metadata attribute</a>. I theorised it had something to do with date being ambiguous without further context, but didn&#39;t pursue it further.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>@Rubenerd Hey Ruben, read your blog post — personally, I have been using <code>&lt;time datetime=&quot;2014-02-19&quot;&gt;</code> for schema microdata since 2012 :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your readership ^_^. Aside from <a href="//rubenerd.com/w3c-rdfa-validation-works/" title="Rubénerd: W3C RDFa validation works, thanks @sideshowbarker">employing RDFa Lite</a> instead, I do the same thing under most circumstances (more on that in a moment). I&#39;ve had my reservations about HTML5, but semantic elements like this are really quite nice. The less abuse of the <code>&lt;abbr&gt;</code> element, the better.</p>
<p>In addition to these date elements, I&#39;ve also used HTML date metadata in page <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> areas to denote the last build date for a site. Perhaps a better alternative is Schema data here too. If so, it strikes me weird that we still have generic HTML metadata like keyword and description, when date is no longer valid.</p>
<p>As for times (hah) when we can&#39;t use <code>&lt;time&gt;</code>, it unfortunately doesn&#39;t jive with my beloved microformats. I&#39;d write an hCalendar task to remind myself to research this futher, but the date wouldn&#39;t be parsed. At least, not at present.</p>
<h3>@zoomosis</h3>
<p>And finally, <a href="https://twitter.com/zoomosis/status/436115619625177088">@zoomosis reminded me </a> of something slightly embarrasing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@Rubenerd You misspelled deprecated on your blog, fwiw.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve been reading that word in documentation since primary school, and I still spell it &quot;depracation&quot;. That and I still call my shoulders my elbows, and vice versa. Old habits don&#39;t die hard, they stick around to make me look even more stupid than my writing here would suggest ;).</p>
