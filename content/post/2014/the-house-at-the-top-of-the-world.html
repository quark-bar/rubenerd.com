<blockquote>
<p>Soon I’d come to the Leopardstown dual carriageway.</p>

<p>It was the first dual carriageway in Ireland; and it was a 100 yards long.</p>

<p>I liked the name.</p>

<p>I don’t remember a town being there; and I certainly saw no leopards.</p>

<p>But I had to cross it anyway to get to the house at the top of the world.</p>
