<p>In our continuing series of song posts from Ben Sidran’s 2013 album <em>Don’t Cry For No Hipster</em>, we learn about the dangers of high performance cars in <em>Brand New Music</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So how’s that new car working out for you?<br />
I hear you got it in baby blue</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like this guy’s taste. But here comes the caution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Got all the girls hooglin’ after you&#8230;<br />
But.. so are the gangsters and the police too.</p>
<p>With a car like that, what could possibly go wrong?<br />
Brand new music&#8230; same old song.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, this isn’t limited to vehicular conveyances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So how’s that new job working out for you?<br />
I understand you buyin’ money and sellin’ money too</p>
<p>With a job like that, what could possibly go wrong?<br />
Brand new music&#8230; same old song.</p>
