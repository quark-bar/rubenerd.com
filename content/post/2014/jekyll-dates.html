<p>I wasn’t happy with the default dates in Jekyll’s liquid markup. It’s been so long since I’ve messed with them, since my site has been running largely unaltered for a few years now.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-basics/output#date">original Shopify docs</a> have all the date formats. For this site, I changed it to:</p>
<pre>
{{ post.date | date: "%A, %d %B, %Y" }}
</pre>
<p>This renders:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wednesday, 11 June 2014.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Incidently, I also had to remember how to escape liquid markup using <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3426182/how-to-escape-liquid-template-tags">raw tags</a>, instead of being interpreted!</p>
