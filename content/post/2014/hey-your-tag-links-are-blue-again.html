<p>After a few purple years, I’m back to my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101230234754///rubenerd.com/">2010 schade of blue</a>. Yes, Schade is my last name, and I like spelling it that way for self-depracation. <a href="http://www.caseyliss.com/">Liss is more</a>.</p>
<p>More importantly, that schade of blue is now rendering tags again! The cool people may not use them now, but I still find them invaluable for finding specific topics. It also restores a <strong>ton</strong> of internal broken links between posts, such as my beloved <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone">pointless-milestone</a>.</p>
<p>After mixed success with Ruby extensions written by myself and others, I discovered the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives">jekyll-archives</a> gem. As the name suggets, it renders archive pages for all sorts of metadata including years, categories and tags. The maintainers of this will be getting a donation, that’s for sure.</p>
