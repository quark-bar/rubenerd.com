<p>A number of people have asked me through various channels why I now only have five posts to a page, when I’ve had ten since the site started. First, I’m flattered anyone noticed! Secondly, it has to do with media.</p>
<p>Since I started blogging, I didn’t want to be another of those dry sites without images on posts. We have this wonderful internet, why limit ourselves to plain text? *Turns out* there’s a perfectly valid reason why: bandwidth. I’ve been optimising my site for retina images, so I decided to reduce the number of posts demanding downloaded assets.</p>
<p>At some point I’ll write some rules to serve retina images only on clients with the appropriate screens. Until then, this seemed like an appropriate compromise.</p>
