<p>The reaction to Mozilla&#39;s decision to <a href="//rubenerd.com/mozilla-firefox-advertiles" title="Rubénerd: Mozilla Firefox advertiles">advertise in Firefox</a> has been interesting to watch. For your consideration, have three responses.</p>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>I ended my <a href="//rubenerd.com/mozilla-firefox-advertiles" title="Rubénerd: Mozilla Firefox advertiles">previous post</a> saying I would reserve further judgement until we got more details. <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/13/more-details-on-directory-tiles/" title="More Details on Directory Tiles">Darren Herman has responded</a> disclosing users will have their locations tracked with GeoIP, and that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of now, our expectation is that we’ll be delivering the number of impressions (how many times a tile was shown) and interactions (how many interactions with a tile, i.e. clicks).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No real surprises here; a regular website would give these metrics. What&#39;s concerning is the word &quot;expectation&quot;, which leaves the door open for using other metrics. Given Firefox contains a user&#39;s entire browsing history, this could be far more than a typical ad platform, possibly even more than Google has. This is particularly ironic given many of us used Firefox instead of Chrome specifically for this reason.</p>
<h3>A no–win situation</h3>
<p>In an admission that the feature is unwanted, commentators have claimed the ads will only appear for a brief time after the first install. Nothing to worry about then, right? Maybe not, as the aptly–named <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/#comment-31">Anonymous Firefox User</a> reminds us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[..] what about users who have Firefox clear out their cache, etc. upon closing. Does this means [sic], each time the browser tab is opened, a new series of ads will be shoved in that users’ face? [..] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, we don&#39;t have the specifics of its behaviour yet. Still, by its very function a reset browser looks the same as a fresh install, which an ad platform wouldn&#39;t be able to tell apart. If it could, it would represent an incomplete reset, which is itself a privacy concern. Hence, a potential no–win situation.</p>
<h3>Language</h3>
<p>John Gruber wrote a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/02/16/mozilla" title="Mozilla Plans to Sell Ads in Firefox Browser">characteristically candid post</a>, where he compared the language used in a Reuters report with Mozilla&#39;s announcement. Comments on the latter post <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/advancingcontent/2014/02/11/publisher-transformation-with-users-at-the-center/#comment-58">liken the language</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doublespeak" title="Wikipedia article on doublespeak">doublespeak</a>, which seems right.</p>
<p>I think it&#39;d be safe to say Mozilla may have had a better response if they had:</p>
<ol>
<li>been honest about their motive for ads in that post;</li>
<li>admitted we don&#39;t want ads in our browser;</li>
<li>and therefore respectfully assured us the necessary ads would be unobtrusive, while addressing potential privacy concerns.</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead, they presented it as a new feature that places &quot;users in the centre&quot;. This doesn&#39;t square with the reality of point 2, therefore even with good intentions it comes across as disingenuous.</p>
<p>I&#39;m grateful to Mozilla for responding to us, but unfortunately it&#39;s done little to assuage my concerns. I&#39;ll be putting money where my mouth is and donating again to the <a href="http://sendto.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Foundation</a> at my earliest convenience, though if they continue to be evasive it may be for the last time.</p>
