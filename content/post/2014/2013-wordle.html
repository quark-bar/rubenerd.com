<p>In what has become an annual tradition around new year, I post a <a href="http://www.wordle.net/">Wordle</a> of the previous year&#39;s posts. A thoroughly unscientific attempt at data mining my own stuff, but fun nonetheless!</p>
<p>At least according to the headings, I continued to talk a lot about anime in 2013. More surprising still, I seem to have spent a long time saying goodbye and happy birthday. Here&#39;s hoping 2014 will have more of the latter, and less of the former.</p>
