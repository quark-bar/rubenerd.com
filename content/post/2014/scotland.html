<p>My mum and I had a tradition on Friday evenings; we’d either watch true crime shows on Discovery Channel, or reruns of <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander:_The_Series">Highlander</a></em> with the dashingly hot, Scottish immortal played by Adrian Paul. No really, look him up.</p>
<p>Some of the episodes were rather dark, but the one we’d always go back to was the &#8220;Stone of Scone&#8221; episode. In it, Duncan MacLeod and his partner in crime Amanda plotted a scheme to steal this priceless relic of Scottish history from Westminster Abbey. The English had stolen it, and with it a part of Scottish sovereignty. Hilarity ensues, with the stone eventually being deposited on a misty Scottish moor, unbeknownst to the golfers playing nearby or the hoodwinked Abbey security guards.</p>
<p>There are some conspiracy theorists who believe this really happened, and that the stone in Westminster was always just a convincing replica. I like to pretend this was true, too.</p>
<p>It’s emblematic of so much Scottish identity since the Acts of Union in 1707.</p>
<h3>I look no good in kilts</h3>
<p>Much of my mum’s family hail from Clan Ross from Inverness in the Scottish Highlands. The featured image is of our clan’s tartan; pretty handsome, am I right? My grandfather has spent a great deal of time researching the family history, including creating a detailed family tree going back generations. I imagine many of us living in former British colonies can trace similar lineage.</p>
<p>It amazes me such a tiny county with relatively few people could have such an impact on the world. Their romantic (and otherwise!) music, their scientists and engineers, the best breakfast food in the world&#8230; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall">not even the Romans could conquer them</a>!</p>
<p style="font-style:italic">(An adage my grandfather loves, and Alton Brown quipped on an episode of Good Eats goes something like this. An Englishman poked fun at a Scot for his love of oats. We feed that to our horses, he cried! To which the Scot replied: that’s why in England you raise fine horses, and in Scotland we raise fine people).</p>
<p>On the 18th of September, Scottish people will be voting on a referendum for independence from the United Kingdom. It&#39;s historic in a global context; the next part to fall away from the once globally reaching empire where the sun never set.</p>
<p>It also brings some practical considerations. Will they model themselves on, say, the <a href="http://www.gov.ie/">Irish Republic</a>? Will they use the British Pound, their own Pound, or the Euro? For that matter, will they be a part of the Eurozone? What about businesses operating on both sides of Hadrian&#39;s Wall? Will they keep The Queen, or elect their own head of state? Will the English arrange to keep some of Scotland&#39;s vast natural resource reserves in the North Sea?</p>
<p>Elsewhere, will this embolden those in Catalonia, or Kurdistan? What will happen to countries like Fiji, Australia or New Zealand that continue to wear colonial hand-me-downs on their flags?</p>
<p>Whatever happens, I&#39;ll be watching closely, and channeling my mum and all our proud ancestors in saying <a href="http://www.yesscotland.net/">yes</a> :).</p>
