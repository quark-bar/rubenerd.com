<p><a href="http://atp.fm/episodes/91">The gang on ATP #91</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Marco:</strong> Git needs a million frontends on it to make it usable [..] even the git commands you use on the command line are front-ends to five other commands doing what you want it to do.</p>
<p><strong>John:</strong> Git is not a great example of a user interface.</p>
<p><strong>Marco:</strong> [..] version control and distributed version control are already complicated problems. Add to that the creator of Linux making the one he wants to use; Git is exactly what you would expect that to be!</p>
