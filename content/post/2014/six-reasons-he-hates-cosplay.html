<p>Yes, that Buzzfeed-inspired heading was a joke, given the critique in today&#39;s post is reserved for this special article &quot;<a href="http://www.craveonline.com.au/comics/articles/735449-six-reasons-i-hate-cosplay-comic-con-2014">Six reasons I hate cosplay</a>&quot;. Let&#39;s take a gander:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He thinks patrons are rude, and the worst are those <em>&quot;dressed as Piku Chikka Uku GooGoo Gaga&quot;</em>. While he may have a point for common courtesy, me thinks he could afford those targets of his racist diatribe the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people don&#39;t know all the details of those they&#39;re cosplaying. Oh you poor dear, have a Bex and good lie down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Women only cosplay as hot characters to get attention, and guys all lear and drool because they want to sleep with them. Yay, sexism. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something something your fake weapons take up space. The Golden Rule would have sufficed without belittling those who may have spent hours building a costume you don&#39;t feel they&#39;re worthy of wearing, or from some <em>&quot;insipid Manga/Japanimation&quot;</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wear the costume you&#39;re built for. I admit, I used to think a little like this. I don&#39;t anymore, because people can express themselves without yours or my approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crowds. Yes, he complained about crowds at a convention.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#39;s possible Mr Robinson wrote this as parody, given it so succinctly summarises all the cliché talking points people level at cosplayers. If he didn&#39;t, let&#39;s pretend he did.</p>
