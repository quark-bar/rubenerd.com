<p>I got a real kick out of these photos by <a href="http://www.trainman.id.au/photos/nsw/steam/38class/">David Johnson</a> taken in 1991. The streamlined, green beast is the 3801. Built in 1943, she&#39;s probably Australia&#39;s most famous and widely travelled steam locomotive. Above her, we have Sydney&#39;s Monorail, built fourtyâ€“four years later in 1987.</p>
<p>Had you asked people at the time which train would still be running in 2014, I wonder how many would have got it?</p>
<p>To be fair, 3801 is still undergoing her <a href="http://heritageexpress.com.au/pages/legendsofsteam/3801/default.htm" title="Heritage Express: The 3801">mechanical overhaul</a>, but it&#39;s hoped she&#39;ll be hauling <em>Heritage Express</em> trains again at some point. Sydney&#39;s Monorail, as widely publicised last year, is now <a href="https://twitter.com/Rubenerd/status/182990807056384001">no more</a>.</p>
