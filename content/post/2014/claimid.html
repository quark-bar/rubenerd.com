<p>So I decided to overhaul my <a rel="me creator" href="http://rubenschade.com">business card vanity site</a>. Checking my ClaimID links and metadata:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
<p>After 7 years, 6 months, and 20 days of service, ClaimID has ceased operations. It was our pleasure to help hundreds of thousands of people manage their online identities, and we thank you for your support!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So much for trying not to say <a href="http://rubenerd.com/2012-wordle/">goodbye</a> as much this year. Iâ€™m just thankful for my skepticism of OpenID in the first place.</p>
