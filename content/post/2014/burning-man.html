<p>Knick, responding to a New York Times article on <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/san-francisco-exhales-during-burning-man-exodus/#permid=12696178">San Francisco’s Burning Man exodus</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
While the adult-children of the Bay Area head out on a compass bearing of 48.8 degrees Northeast to Gerlach and environs for a few days of post-apocalyptic mud, dust and dissolution, the Bay Area’s adult-adults choose ANY other cardinal direction and revisit the universe of woods, rocks, beaches, water and magic night skies that are the real world.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be fair, the desert can be beautiful too.</p>
<p>For those unaware, <em>Burning Man</em> is this thing where people do stuff. Along with the <em>Comics O’logy</em> thing, it also makes many podcasts insufferable.</p>
