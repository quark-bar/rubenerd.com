<p>Vyatta is a Debian-based software router and firewall that has a familar, hardware-router-like syntax. It’s rather nice.</p>
<p>This morning, VyOS was being discussed in the AusNOG mailing lists. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VyOS">From Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After Brocade Communications stopped development of the Vyatta Core Edition of the Vyatta Routing software, a small group of enthusiasts took the last Community Edition, and worked on building an Open Source version to live on in place of the end of life VC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems there are some who <a href="http://libertysys.com.au/blog/the-tragedy-of-vyatta-cores-demise">aren’t too happy</a> about the Brocade buyout. Regardless, it won’t be changing anything here, for the time being.</p>
<p>With the official Vyatta site now relegated to a redirect, the best documentation and information source seems to be the <a href="http://www.vyattawiki.net/wiki/Main_Page">Unofficial Vyatta Wiki</a>.</p>
