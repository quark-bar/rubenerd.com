<p style="font-style:italic">2015 is less than two months away, so its time to clear out the drafts folder. This post was drafted in January.</p>
<p>Here in 2014, the Georgia font is out, and inscrutable meatstack icons (pardon “hamburger icons”), fonts as big as your head and full-height banner images are in. Every second site is now also employing Helvetica Neue Light and Ultra Light, presumably in an effort to ape iOS 7.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us, such efforts are hopelessly misguided. Apple was able to employ these fonts on iOS 7 because every client using it (save for the first iPad mini) would have a Retina screen. Regular displays lack the resolution to render ultra-lightweight fonts with sufficient detail to be readable. This is why lightweight fonts were seldom used on computer displays before.</p>
<p>Subpixel rendering and antialising improve the appearance of many fonts. If you’re relying on it entirely to make your text readable, you’ve doing it wrong. If you’re basing your exploit-friendly CSS font imports on user-agent, by all means give Retina clients that <abbr title="cross site scripting">XSS</abbr> malware vector. Otherwise, please stick to regular weight fonts at a minimum.</p>
<p>Believe me, I’m looking forward to the day we all have Retina-grade screens and such fonts will be fine. The irony is by the time that happens, Helvetica Neue will be passé.</p>
