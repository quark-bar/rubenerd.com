<p>It has come to my attention that web designers are abusing the non–standard <code>-webkit-font-smoothing</code> CSS property to make fonts look thinner, fuzzier and crappier on the Mac.</p>
<p>There are two possible reasons for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It’s a misguided attempt at cross-platform, lowest common denominator design. The idea sounds great in theory, but then again so did GUI Java applications. Let the OS handle this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Worst still, some are doing it on purpose. No, your &#8220;fixes&#8221; make it look worse. Get over yourselves, and stop messing with it. Don’t like how it looks? Use Windows or Linux and their sub–par font rendering.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the words of Maddox, if you disagree with this post, you are wrong.</p>
