<p>It&#39;s been <a href="http://rubenerd.com/cool-paradise-01">three years</a> since we had a Ben Sidran album series. This is clearly three years too many. I&#39;d say maybe even longer, if that were possible.</p>
<p>To rectify this, I&#39;ve been listening to his 2013 album <em><a href="http://bensidran.com/album/dont-cry-for-no-hipster">Don&#39;t Cry for No Hipster</a></em>. He had me at the title, but its songs are equally splendid. It&#39;s the cool witty bebop jazz we know Ben for, replete with his trademark troll endings and the distinct feeling he&#39;s grinning from ear to ear as he lets us have the lyrics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I really dig are those little cars.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the first track in this series, let&#39;s hear his take on golf.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hmm, I&#39;m thinkin&#39; of making my own tees made up.<br />
Say&#8230; bebop&#8230; bebop tees.<br />
Put a ball on a bebop tee&#8230; goes where it pleases.</p>
</blockquote>
