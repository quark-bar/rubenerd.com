<p>Like the curmudgeon posing as a 20-something that I am, I don’t use HTML email. I don’t send it, I don’t read it. It’s mere existence is a bane upon the internet world; its responsible for so much malware and obfuscated links to malware, to say nothing about the taste (or lack thereof) of such email stationary! But I digress.</p>
<p>Well formed email with HTML will generally offer a plain text version in the same message, so it can gracefully degrade. Others don’t, forcing me to decipher the message in a sea of markup.</p>
<p>When that happens, you sometimes see some fun stuff. A message from a disgruntled sysadmin reminding writers not to mess with the tag, lest they get blamed for the email not looking right on phones?</p>
