<p>I don’t live in the US, nor do I watch HBO programming. Well, other than <em>Carnivale</em>, that show was sublime.</p>
<p>Still, I’ve heard every podcaster wax lyrical about HBO’s Go service crashing during the premiere of the latest <em>Game of Thrones</em>. How did such a huge media company botch something so spectacularly? Was HBO CEO’s lack of concern about login credential sharing a wise position? Can HBO even be blamed, given even the mightly Apple couldn’t handle WWDC booking traffic?</p>
<p>Strangely, nobody has stated the obvious. That we’ve already solved the issue of <abbr title="content delivery network">CDN</abbr> resouce contention. If only I could remember what that decentralised, distributed technology was…</p>
