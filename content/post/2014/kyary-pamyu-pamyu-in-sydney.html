<p>Suffice to say, I was far too busy jumping around and generally making a complete nerdy arse of myself to take decent pictures during Kyaryâ€™s first Australian concert. In a nod to her fans here, she even donned koala ears towards the end!</p>
<p>There was a time in my teens and early twenties when I gave a shit about what other people thought of my hobbies, musical tastes and so forth. Surrounded by anime otaku, nerds and J-Pop fans all dressed in their costumes dancing along to the <a href="//rubenerd.com/ponponpon-kyary-pamyu-pamyu/">shamelessly clean fun</a> of Kyary was an amazing experience. That feeling of belonging as we revel in this unique culture was even more so.</p>
<p>Arigato~ ^_^. Both to Kyary, and to <a rel="friend met co-worker kin muse crush date sweetheart" href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> for shouting me these tickets for my birthday :&#8221;).</p>
