<p>So there I was, looking into PPPoE authentication, pinging servers, making sure I had all of the millions of ADSL settings correct in the router and modem. In a story that would be even too cliché to render as a <em>Big Bang Theory</em> episode, it turns out our <a href="//rubenerd.com/the-sound-of-pppoe-silence/" title="Rubénerd: The Sound of PPPoe silence">internet was down</a> due to a <strong>chewed phone cable</strong>.</p>
<p>Our current house is pretty old, so we route a phone cable under it to reach the room with the computers. Above the house, the plugs all looked fine, but below an animal had clearly developed a taste for plastic! There are some pretty mean looking lizards around here that we&#39;ve already caught chewing strange things, this could be the latest.</p>
<p>Basic, obvious, <em>head–against–the–wall</em> stupid lesson learned: if your internet is down, check all of your wiring, not just the wiring you can see!</p>
<p>I&#39;d also like to thank TPG email support for their prompt responses and patience in light of a client who had issues that were clearly out of their control. They were a class act, and I appreciate it :).</p>
