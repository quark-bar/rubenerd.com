<p>My comment below about luck being &#8220;fortuitous circumstances&#8221; in my <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/happiness/">last post</a> stirred up some discussion:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a scientist I ascribe fortuitous circumstances to the term luck, but that’s far less succinct and fun to say.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most comments suggested that luck comes down to what you make of a situation.</p>
<p>I think, subtly, such reasoning is an excuse to guilt trip people. It’s akin to dismissing people with bad luck as being lazy, or unmotivated. Throw superficially &#8220;good fortune&#8221; or situations at people, and they may still not be able to, for entirely their own reasons. </p>
