<p>Forgive the ridiculous size of the accompanying image, but it’s not often an <strong>icon</strong> of your childhood is brought back to life again! Earlier this month, the <a title="アニメ：美少女戦士セーラームーン20周年プロジェクト公式サイト" href="http://sailormoon-official.com/animation/">SAILOR MOON 20th Anniversary Project Official Site</a> released the first official art for the upcoming <em>Sailor Moon Crystal</em> series.</p>
<p>For a <em>Sailor Moon</em> nerd, there are a few things of note here. First, references to the original Jupiter, Mercury, Venus and Mars senshi appear in the background, suggesting the cast will be limited to them&#8230; maybe? Usagi is also sporting her original transformed seifuku from the first series, albeit with a different bow clasp. A reboot <em>ala</em> Star Trek?</p>
<p>As I’m sure many of you would have done if you were a child in the 1990s, I grew up watching those horrible DIC dubs of Sailor Moon. Imagine my surprise a decade later when I watched the original Japanese series’ and saw all the things the Western distributors saw fit to omit. I’ve also been catching up with the Sailor Moon manga which has been re–released into English; no more lamenting not being able to read one of my all–time favourite series <a title="Rubénerd: Ruben Can't Read Japanese" href="http://rubenerd.com/ruben-cant-read-japanese/">like I did back in 2006</a>!</p>
<p><em>Sailor Moon Crystal</em> was due for release last year, but was repeatedly pushed back. I’m fine with this, they should take all the time they need to get it right. When dealing with such a venerable cultural icon, one can’t be too careful!</p>
