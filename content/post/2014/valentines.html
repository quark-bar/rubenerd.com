<p>Clara and I aren&#39;t really into the whole flashy–Valentines thing. Neither of us had anyone for most of our lives, and we&#39;re both painfully aware of how small the holiday can make you feel when you don&#39;t have someone.</p>
<p>So instead, we spent our evening doing what we did when I first confessed to her: hanging out at <a href="http://www.happy-lemon.com/">Happy Lemon</a> and sipping bubble tea and rock salt cheese coffee. We even discovered an amazing new bakery in Sydney which will be the subject of an upcoming post.</p>
<p>That said, Clara did go out of her way to make me a box of adorable chocolates, and spent an amount of time I&#39;m too afraid to ask about drawing that epic picture of the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/mascot/" title="Rubénerd: Mascot">Rubénerd mascot Rubi</a> above. How she can call herself untalented is absolutely beyond me, though I suppose her modesty was one of the things that attracted me to her in the first place ^_^.</p>
