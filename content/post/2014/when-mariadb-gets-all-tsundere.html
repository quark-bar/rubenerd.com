<p style="font-style:italic">This is a <a href="http://utsanime.net/2014/02/when-mariadb-gets-all-tsundere/" title="Anime@UTS: When MariaDB gets all tsundere">cross–post from Anime@UTS</a>, the University of Technology Sydney’s best (and only) anime club. Desu~</p>
<p>Hello club members! Over the coming days, your humble second term webmaster will be unfurling the new site design and back end. Developed with Kiri, it will be bolder and more interesting than the current theme, along with a few new features I hope will make the site more awesome for all ^_^.</p>
<p>As part of a behind the scenes look into the <a href="http://myanimelist.net/anime/11843/Danshi_Koukousei_no_Nichijou" title="MyAnimeList: Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou">Daily Lives of Webmasters</a> (and Webmistresses), I thought I&#39;d share a local issue I had, and the solution so absurdly simple it&#39;d make any other webmaster and sysadmin enter hammerspace to retrieve a weapon to beat me senseless with. Alex knows what I&#39;m talking about.</p>
<h3>It&#39;s not like I wanted you to start, or anything</h3>
<p>I&#39;d been rebuilding my local (and increasingly misnamed) LAMP stack on my MacBook Air to test prior to deployment. The world seems to be moving to <a href="https://mariadb.org/" title="The official site of MariaDB and the MariaDB Foundation">MariaDB</a> for reasons that are beyond the scope of this post, so rather than updating MySQL I figured I&#39;d give it a shot.</p>
<p>The following errors in the log file said <strong>OH NO YOU DON&#39;T</strong>:</p>

<p>Well darn, I said, as I stroked my non existent beard. Frank would do that better than me.</p>
<p>The problem, as is perennially the case, existed between my keyboard and chair. In the process of uninstalling MySQL and installing MariaDB, I&#39;d failed to remove MySQL&#39;s logfiles which differed in size to what MariaDB was expecting.</p>
<p>Removing these logfiles solved the issue. Once removed, MariaDB was able to recreate them to its taste:</p>
<pre>% rm /usr/local/var/mysql/ib_logfile*
% echo Everybody's Heard that The Bird is The Word
% echo Desu
</pre>
<p>What does this have to with anime? <strong>Baka</strong>, it&#39;s everything! Which means, I got nothing. Happy Saturday!</p>
