<p>Isn&#39;t that sweet? Groundskeeper Willie, Kusugawa Sasara, Mr. Alpaca Coffee and Nagato Yuki <a title="Photo on Flickr" href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/12969324074/">huddled around a campfire</a> to celebrate four thousand Rubénerd posts!</p>
<p>I know, it feels like déjà vu. Back when I used WordPress, we prematurely <a href="//rubenerd.com/wordpress-4000/" title="Rubénerd: WordPress post ID 4000 celebration">celebrated post ID 4000</a>. Careful of the cinders, don&#39;t sit too close! Before I spun off my Twitter archives, we <a href="//rubenerd.com/4000th-post/" title="Rubénerd post 4000 celebration!">reached 4000 in 2011</a>. Had I not <a href="//rubenerd.com/anime-restarting/" title="Rubénerd: Restarting my anime blog">lost a ton of my anime posts</a>, we probably would have reached this milestone again a lot sooner.</p>
<p>Still, aren&#39;t regular celebrations the best? Happy 4000 everyone, and an especially huge thank you for your readership, discussions and support over these nine years. Pass the strawberry marshmallows, will you? ^_^</p>
