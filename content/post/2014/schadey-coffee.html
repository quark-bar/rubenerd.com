<p>I would make a lousy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori">hikkamori</a>. While I need to recharge my introverted batteries after extended social interactions, I need to do it outside home. Sitting at cafes with my laptop and cup of black coffee, I can just let the outside world melt away in a way you intuitively wouldn’t expect. I don’t understand how it works, but it does!</p>
<p>Given the physiological importance of these outings, I wondered if there were any ways I could improve them. For one, is it better to sit outside or inside?</p>
<p>Previously, I tended to gravitate towards indoors. The air is climate controlled, you’re not exposed to the <del>elephants</del> elements, its easier to read the laptop screen. It would seem to be the logical choice.</p>
<p>Then we moved to Hornsby, and my new favourite coffee shop became The Refinery Espresso. They have an indoor section, but its entirely open to the street. I was worried that drinking superior brews in a less than optimal laptopping environment would have a negative impact.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, it was quite the opposite. I can’t put it into words, but it was far more invigorating. Whether it can be attributed to not breathing recirculated air, or getting more of that natural environment thing I keep reading about, I don’t know. Like the cafe effect itself, I can’t quantify it, I just know it works.</p>
<p>Now, if I can, I sit at outdoor coffee shops. Give me some schade [sic].</p>
