<p>A task today was performing some ServerBear benchmarks on VMs. ServerBear is a comparison site for cloud, VPS and other platform infrastructure providers that displays the results of user run benchmark scripts. </p>
<p>Running on an instance, without publishing the results:</p>
<pre><code>wget -N https://raw.github.com/Crowd9/Benchmark/master/sb.sh &amp;&amp; 
bash sb.sh '[Server name]' '[Server plan]' '[email]' '[price]' private
</code></pre>
<p>Running it on stock Debian without sudo, the script failed. sudo either needs to be installed and enabled for the current user, or you can just run as root.</p>
<p>It also takes the liberty of updating apt-get, then installing the following if they’re not found:</p>
<ul>
<li>build-essential</li>
<li>libaio-dev</li>
<li>curl</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll admit, that was a little unsettling. For further tests, I’ll be installing these myself first.</p>
<p>Outside the package manager, it downloads:</p>
<ul>
<li>FIO</li>
<li>IOPing</li>
<li>UnixBench</li>
</ul>
<p>The reported steps:</p>
<pre><code>Running dd I/O benchmark...
Running IOPing I/O benchmark...
Running FIO benchmark...
Running bandwidth benchmark...
Running traceroute...
Running ping benchmark...
Running UnixBench benchmark...	
</code></pre>
<p>Be prepared to wait an hour or so, depending on the performance of the infrastructure. When complete, check your inbox shortly after for the results.</p>
