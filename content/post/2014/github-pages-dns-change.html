<p>A few people on Twitter moved to Github Pages on my recommendation, so passing this latest message from Github along:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you use a custom domain with GitHub Pages, please verify that your domainâ€™s DNS settings are properly configured to point to the most up-to-date GitHub IP addresses. This will ensure that your site remains available after December 1st, 2014.</p>
