<p>For a brief period between Palm Tungsten and Centro smartphones, I <a href="http://rubenerd.com/nokia-e61i-screenshot-of-iphone-site/">used a Nokia e61i</a>. The full <code>qwerty</code> keyboard was a little mushy, but Symbian was a perfectly fine OS. Some of my first tweets and TwitPics came from that device.</p>
<p>At some point, I must have registered for Nokia services online, so I got <a href="http://ct.nokia.com/?7559912575_811687890">the message</a> from Microsoft:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://ct.nokia.com/?7559912575_811687890">
<p>Reminder: Termination of Nokia Sync and Impact to You</p>
<p>Dear Nokia mobile phone customer,</p>
<p>We wanted to let you know of important changes affecting people who use Nokia Sync on Nokia Series 40, N9 and Symbian phones. Nokia Sync is the service that synchronises your contacts, calendar appointments and notes between your phone and the cloud.</p>
<p>We are planning to discontinue the Nokia Sync service on 5 December 2014. After 5 December 2014, you will not be able to access your data through the Nokia Sync service. We strongly encourage you to export and/or migrate your data from the service before this date.</p>
<p>Beginning today, you can use the following options to ensure you can continue to access your data. This includes the option to export your data so it can be imported into other services, or migrate your data to secure, cloud-based services from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Option 1: <a href="http://ct.nokia.com/?7559912575">Export</a><br />
Option 2: <a href="http://ct.nokia.com/?7559912575">Migrate</a></p>
<p>In the interest of information privacy, all data that is stored in Nokia Sync will be destroyed following termination of the Nokia Sync service.</p>
<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. If you have any further questions, please see our CARE support site CARE Nokia Sync.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />
Services Team at Microsoft Devices</p>

<p>Another nail in the proverbial coffin for one of the world’s formerly great electronics companies. Also further proof that if you value your data, to keep it backed up yourself. Online services and sites don’t last.</p>
