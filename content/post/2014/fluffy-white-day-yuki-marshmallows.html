<p>For White Day this year, Clara bought me a cute bag of gourmet marshmallows made with real fruit. I’m highly partial to these fluffy deserts, and these are—without a doubt—the most decadant I’ve ever had. No plate or bowl, even a <a title="Fate for Breakfast album page on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fate_for_Breakfast">Desimone original</a>, seem worthy to contain them!</p>
<p>For those who aren’t familiar, Clara has a <a title="Kirinyan: White Day SWEETNESS" href="http://kirinyan.net/white-day-sweetness/">far more eloquent and interesting post</a> about the subject of White Day than I could ever do. Not that she would admit this, given her modest nature.</p>
<p>Thank you Clara :&#8221;)</p>
