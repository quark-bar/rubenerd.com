<p>I’ve really been spoiled by <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/firewalls-pf.html">pf on the BSDs</a>. By comparison, Linux’s iptables are complex and nasty enough to have spawned dozens of tools for indirect maniplation, such that you don’t have to write them yourself.</p>
<p>The one I’ve used most frequently is <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall">Canonical’s ufw</a>. An alternative I’m coming around to is <a href="http://firehol.org/">FireHOL</a>, which is carefully advertised as a firewall language, rather than a script frontend.</p>
<p>The first gotcha was in enabling it on Debian. I’m very much used to <code style="white-space:nowrap">/etc/default</code> configuration files being immutable defaults, hence the directory name. If you want to define non-default configuration, you create a separate file to override these settings. For FireHol, you have to enable it from within its <code style="white-space:nowrap">/etc/default/firehol</code> file:</p>
<pre>
#To enable firehol at startup set START_FIREHOL=YES
START_FIREHOL=YES
#If you want to have firehol wait for an iface to be up add it here
WAIT_FOR_IFACE=""
</pre>
<p>Then you can define rules in <code style="white-space:nowrap">/etc/firehol/firehol.conf</code>. As an example, this box will only accept the following incoming (<code>server</code>) and outgoing (<code>client</code>) services. The <code>protection</code> option provides sane defaults for flood and malformed packet protection:</p>
<pre>
## Crazy basic FireHOL configuration
version 5

interface "eth0" internet
    protection strong
    server "ping ssh" accept
    client "dns http https ntp ssh" accept
</pre>
<p>It looks as though the quotes are optional in this case, but I think they render user settings and commands easier to distinguish. Regardless, the <a href="http://firehol.org/firehol-manual/">Reference Manual</a> lists all the options.</p>
<h3>Problem existed between keyboard and chair</h3>
<p>So far, the only option I’ve had issues with is <code>ipv4</code>. It says I should be able to do this:</p>
<pre>
interface "eth0" public-net
    [..]
    ipv4 server "ping ssh" accept
</pre>
<p>But doing so results in an error:</p>
<pre>
[....] Restarting Firewall configuration:[..]
line 17: ipv4: command not found
</pre>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> This appears to only work in the context of defining rules for both ipv4 and ipv6. The <a href="http://firehol.org/firehol-manual/firehol-modifiers/">modifiers page</a> lists examples:</p>
<pre>
interface eth0 myboth src4 192.0.2.0/24 src6 2001:DB8::/24
    ipv4 server http accept
    ipv4 client http accept
</pre>
