<p style="font-style:italic;">Due to a respiratory infection which has knocked me out like a bad coffee, I’m publishing this <a title="Rubénerd: Yearly draft cleanout" href="//rubenerd.com/yearly-draft-cleanout/">draft post</a> from December <del>2012</del> 2013. In light of <a href="https://medium.com/p/24eb09e026dd">Naoki Hiroshima’s Twitter extortion</a>, it seemed prescient.

<p>I take no joy in reporting that <a href="http://switchfusion.com.sg">Switch Fusion</a> appears to be no more. As of today, the Singaporean webhost didn&#39;t even renew their domain name.</p>
<p>Switch Fusion were my first paid webhost. In 2001, I registered the Rubenerd.com domain with them and went on their 2GB plan. Their uptime, performance and general reliability appeared solid, though today I recognise taking two days to enable a vanilla cPanel account for me was a bit silly.</p>
<h3>When they own your domain</h3>
<p>After three years of service, my burgeoning <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/" title="The Rubenerd Show">podcast</a> was testing the limits of my hosting plan. Rather than upgrade, I decided to move shop. I was about to <a href="//rubenerd.com/bye-servage/" title="Rubénerd: Bye Servage!">learn the lesson</a> of not trusting suspiciously affordable sites with unlimited bandwidth or storage claims, but that&#39;s for another post.</p>
<p>When I first requested the domain to be transferred to my new hosting company, I heard back nothing. Months before my Switch Fusion account was due to expire, I lodged support tickets, emailed and called without success. The situation got critical, and I had to register the interim RubenerdShow.com domain to use with my new host while I worked out the domain ownership. Switch Fusion cancelled my account, and kept my domain.</p>
<p>Eventually, I got an email back from an alleged representative of Switch Fusion with an Indonesian email address. They informed me they could transfer my domain under my name for US$200.00. Initially I thought it was a scam, but further investigation showed it to be legitimate. Switch Fusion&#39;s domain broker wanted US$200 to transfer ownership of the domain to me.</p>
<h3>I baulked, and walked away</h3>
<p>After rejecting their offer, I was certain my beloved old domain would fall into the hands of a squatter, and sure enough it eventually did. I did a whois and marked on my calendar when the domain was to expire, and in 2009 I pounced. I got <strong>extremely</strong> lucky, and regained ownership of my original domain which you&#39;re now reading from.</p>
<p>Lesson learned, don&#39;t trust a webhost with domain registration. Use a reputable third party like Hover, for example. Which reminds me, <a href="https://hover.com/onswj3NQ" title="Register a domain with Hover with my referral code">if you use this referral link</a>, I get a couple of bucks off my next registration :).</p>
<p>As for Switch Fusion, I&#39;m thankful for all the help they gave a young high school student starting out on the web, but what they ended up doing to me (<a href="http://www.sgwebhostingtalk.com/showthread.php?t=14193" title="Singapore Web Hosting Talk: Definitely not Switch Fusion">and others</a>) lacked class. I like to think it was their legal and financial department letting down an otherwise nice IT team.</p>
