<p>With the latest Slashdot Beta site being compared unfavourably to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digg#Digg_v4">Digg 4.0</a>, an alternative community of nerds craving <em>stuff that matters</em> have formed around a new site. Dubbed <a href="http://soylentnews.org/">SoylentNews</a>, the site runs from the same codebase as Slashdot but with a layout and theme that preserves the traditional threaded comment system.</p>
<p>As a worried Slashdot lurker and occasional commentator, I&#39;ve had a poke around and it seems technically promising. Leaving aside the seeming inability of <abbr title="free libre open source software">FLOSS</abbr> communities to brand themselves (though to be fair, <em>Rub√©nerd</em> isn&#39;t much better), it has all the ingredients that made the original Slashdot so much fun to read over all these years.</p>
<p>Ironically enough, all that&#39;s missing is the people. Time will tell if a meaningful number make the switch, or whether the site provides the impetus to Dice to listen to their adopted community. Either way, right?</p>
