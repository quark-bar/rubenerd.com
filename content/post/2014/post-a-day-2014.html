<p>As a few keen readers have already observed, I&#39;ve decided to do <em>Post A Day</em> again this year. I did it in 2011 to prove I could, but this year its all about keeping my stockpile of drafts down!</p>
<p>Last year, I noticed that many of my posts were being written, but never published. For some, it was due to a lack of accompanying art or diagrams that I insist on having. Others just lacked links, or introductions, or appropriate metadata.</p>
<p>Regardless of the reason, many ended up losing their timliness in the draft stack. There&#39;s a title for a potential <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/">Back To Work</a> episode if ever I&#39;ve heard one! Dan, Merlin, let me know when you can get back to me about a cut of the next episode&#39;s revenue.</p>
<p>But anyway, recognising this trend in myself made me want to do something about it. I&#39;m not sure if posting daily will help to regularly clear my draft folders, but so far it seems to have worked. More of my words in 2014 are seeing the light of day, which feels great.</p>
<p>As for whether blogging about posting daily should really count as a post itself, I leave that as a pedantic thought exercise for the reader. Personally, I&#39;ve been hit with the manflu again these last couple of days, and today was particularly hard. If there were a degree of slack to be cut, I feel at least a little could be spared.</p>
<p>If you&#39;d like to give it a try while the year is still young, the <a href="http://dailypost.wordpress.com/">Daily Post team at WordPress</a> have a great supportive blog full of ideas.</p>
