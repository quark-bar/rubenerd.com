<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email">Ladar Levison's article in The Guardian</a> on why he had to shut down Lavabit:</p>

<p>My company, Lavabit, provided email services to 410,000 people – including Edward Snowden, according to news reports – and thrived by offering features specifically designed to protect the privacy and security of its customers. I had no choice but to consent to the installation of their device, which would hand the US government access to all of the messages – to and from all of my customers – as they travelled between their email accounts other providers on the Internet.

<p>Bothered by what the agents were saying, I informed them that I would first need to read the order they had just delivered – and then consult with an attorney. The feds seemed surprised by my hesitation. </p>

<p>The entire process was eye opening. He closes with a warning:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/20/why-did-lavabit-shut-down-snowden-email"><p>If my experience serves any purpose, it is to illustrate what most already know: courts must not be allowed to consider matters of great importance under the shroud of secrecy, lest we find ourselves summarily deprived of meaningful due process.</p></blockquote>
