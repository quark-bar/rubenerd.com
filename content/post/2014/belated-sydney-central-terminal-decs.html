<p>For your consideration, a <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/11707237726/">decorated photo of Sydney Central Station</a> taken this evening. That was a long link.</p>
<p>Given its been more than a week since Christmas, Clara and I theorise this is Sydney Trains making good for the fact the decorations went up so late. Earlier in December, we had already began to worry they were the latst victims of cost cutting; all that <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/bouncing-ball-branding-cost-transport-1mplus-20130819-2s7bc.html">expensive rebranding</a> had to be paid for with something.</p>
<p>Regardless, we&#39;re okay with seeing the pretty lights and decorations for a little longer :)</p>
