<p><a href="//rubenerd.com/when-mariadb-gets-all-tsundere/" title="RubÃ©nerd: When MariaDB gets all tsundere">Speaking of MariaDB</a>, that has to be one of the <a href="https://mariadb.com/about" title="About MariaDB">best About page photos</a> I&#39;ve seen in a long time!</p>
<p>In my part of the world, it appears we have MariaDB developers in Japan, Korea and Australia. The way the Malaysia developer has his feet in Borneo and the Peninsula is very cute :).</p>
