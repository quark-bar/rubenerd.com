<p>I just found <a href="http://www.justdropped.com/drops/071406com.html">this page</a> of dropped domains from the 14th of July 2006. Low and behold:</p>
<pre>
rubbermaid-supplier.com
ruben-gil.com
<strong>rubenerd.com</strong>
rubiconmercantile.com
rucksackwanderers.com
ruddockphotography.com
</pre>
<p>In 2006, I moved to another webhost. The previous mob wanted several hundred dollars to transfer ownership of the domain to me. I wrote about <a href="//rubenerd.com/switchfusion-is-no-more/">this rort</a> back in January. It took a few years, but I eventually <a href="//rubenerd.com/we-are-back/">got it back</a>.</p>
<p>Lesson learned, always register your domain with a third party, such as <a href="https://hover.com/onswj3NQ">Hover</a>!</p>
