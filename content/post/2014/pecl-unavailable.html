<p>While installing a testing version of MediaWiki on a VM instance, the welcome page warned that an environment check had failed:</p>
<pre>
Warning: The intl PECL extension is not available to handle  
Unicode normalization, falling back to slow pure-PHP  
implementation.  
  
If you run a high-traffic site, you should read a little on  
Unicode normalization. 
</pre>
<p>I had been careful (as always) to use the following line in my nginx.conf:</p>
<pre>
use utf-8;
</pre>
<p>In this case though, php5-intl needed to be installed:</p>
<pre>
# apt-get install php5-intl
</pre>
<p>The resulting download was 22.5MB, which seemed a little large. Regardless, after downloading, the intl.ini mod was loaded and the PHP5 FastCGI Process Manager reloaded:</p>
<pre>
==&gt; Setting up libicu48:amd64 (4.8.1.1-12+deb7u1) ...  
==&gt; Setting up php5-intl (5.4.4-14+deb7u10) ...  
==&gt; Creating config file /etc/php5/mods-available/intl.ini   
==&gt;     with new version   
==&gt; Processing triggers for php5-fpm ...  
==&gt; [ ok ] Restarting PHP5 FastCGI Process Manager: php5-fpm.
</pre>
<p>Now the MediaWiki install environment check reported:</p>
<pre>
Using the intl PECL extension for Unicode normalization.
</pre>
