<p>I somewhat resent the claim that some of the world&#39;s most important inventions and scientific discoveries were &quot;accidents&quot;. Granted, the initial spark may have been unintentional, but further developing an idea to its full potential takes its own kind of genius. Penicillin, and the work of Alexander Fleming, Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain is but one example.</p>
<p>But we digress! This incomplete loading of a JPEG <a href="//rubenerd.com/jekyll-timezones/" title="RubÃ©nerd: Jekyll timezones">from some guy&#39;s blog post</a> is a <strong>genuine</strong> accident that ended up producing something quite beautiful, I thought. It&#39;s as though Singapore was gifted a honourary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiphala">Wiphala</a> from Bolivia, irregularly tessellated and bound with further bands of colour for added effect.</p>
<p>Or maybe it&#39;s just a mess of incomplete JPEG data; whatever floats your boat. Or your square flag, as it were.</p>
