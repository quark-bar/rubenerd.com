<p>I keep meaning to blog about technical learnings, pontifications and anime, given they&#39;ve been the entire multifarious point of this site for years. Things just keep happening though!</p>
<p>Today in our continuing cavalcade of consternation, our family awoke to downed internet. I can just picture the internet, flying so innocently up in the sky, before the daemons force it to land. That&#39;s a terrible analogy, given daemons are usually my friends and would most likely be operating much of the internet infrastructure that allows me to write this post in the first place.</p>
<p>Of course, just as we all flick the light switches during power failures, the first thing I tried was a web search to figure out what could be the problem. I think the neighbours heard me shout &quot;derp&quot;.</p>
<p>For the first time in a long while, kicking (rebooting, for my non sysadmin friends!) the router and modem didn&#39;t achieve anything. Regardless of whether the modem was dialing, or the router or my MacBook Air were dialing PPPoE over the modem in bridge mode, we got a deafening silence. Either our local exchange is down, or our ISP isn&#39;t accepting connections.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, I&#39;ll be calling that Australian ISP that rhymes with <em>AEG</em>. In the meantime, just as we all jump into hamster wheels when the power goes down, I&#39;d better tell my other house members to tether with their iPhones tonight.</p>
<p>My apologies to Simon and Garfunkel for this post. Water under the bridge, I hope.</p>
