<p>If you need to download a series of images, such as nineteen project slides that were uploaded individually (argh!), you can get this done easily with curl:</p>
<pre>
% curl -O "http://example.com/[01-10].jpg"
</pre>
<p>Sometimes though, you’ll end up with empty files. If people publish their files through a <abbr title="content delivery network">CDN</abbr>, the <abbr title="universal resource locator">URL</abbr> may simply be a redirect. To follow these and download the original:</p>
<pre>
% curl -OL "http://example.com/[01-10].jpg"
</pre>
<p>This is just scratching the surface, but it’s a substantial part of what I use curl for. Now I just wish my hair didn’t in humid weather.</p>
