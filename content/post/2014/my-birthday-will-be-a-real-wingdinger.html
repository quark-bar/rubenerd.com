<p>There’s just so much stuff being announced or released on my birthday, it’s almost too much excitement to bear! Bare? Bear? From the <a href="http://www.noahmovie.com.au/">NOAH website</a>, which is almost too funny in an of itself:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.noahmovie.com.au/"><p>Russell Crowe stars as Noah in the film inspired by the epic story of courage, sacrifice and hope.  Directed by visionary filmmaker Darren Aronofsky. [..] Australia: 27 MAR 14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds&#8230; super duper. But here’s some far more interesting news. <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-ceo-nadella-may-unveil-office-on-ipad-on-march-27-7000027400/">From Mary Jo Foley</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-ceo-nadella-may-unveil-office-on-ipad-on-march-27-7000027400/"><p>Microsoft has scheduled a March 27 press briefing in San Francisco [..] The [Office] suite for the iPad is rumored to include only Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote, and possibly no other Office client apps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’d be quite interested in an iPad Excel, depending on its implementation. There’s no OpenOffice/LibreOffice for the iPad, and I’ve never been able to grok Numbers.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is expected to be downloaded from the Apple Store but most likely to require a Micrososoft Office 365 subscription</p>
</blockquote>
<p>H-happy birthday to me!</p>
<p style="font-style:italic">As an aside, I’m aware this hasn’t been the Microsoft Office logo for almost a decade. I just make it a habit of including logos that are more awesome than their replacements. Case in point, <a title="Rubénerd: Exception and Throwable Java classes" href="http://rubenerd.com/java-exception-throwable/">Java</a> and <a title="Rubénerd: Telstra joins the Plaintext Password Parade" href="http://rubenerd.com/telstra-customer-database-exposed/">Telstra</a>.</p>
