<p>As defined by page 45 of the New South Wales Road Users&#39; Handbook, the early warning signs of fatigue are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yawning.</li>
<li>Poor concentration.</li>
<li>Tired or sore eyes.</li>
<li>Restlessness.</li>
<li>Drowsiness.</li>
<li>Slow reactions.</li>
<li>Boredom.</li>
<li>Feeling irritable.</li>
<li>Making fewer and larger steering corrections.</li>
<li>Missing road signs.</li>
<li>Having difficulty staying in the lane.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;d add heat. A lot of people I talk to claim to feel cold when fatigued; for some reason I feel as though I&#39;m burning up. I also feel overconfident in my joke telling abilities.</p>
<p>And something I didn&#39;t know:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During peak holiday travel periods, such as Christmas, Easter and holiday long weekends, almost 100 Community Driver Reviver sites operate throughout NSW. These are places to take a break during a long journey and have a free cup of tea or coffee and a snack. Local volunteers are on hand to offer advice about road conditions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s really cool.</p>
