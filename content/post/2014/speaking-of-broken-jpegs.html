<p>Remember my <a href="http://rubenerd.com/accidental-jpeg-wiphalas/">artistically broken JPEG</a> that rendered as if it were a series of Wiphalas? Not to be outdone by its past self, today my MacBook Air mixed my <a href="http://rubenerd.com/total-non-recall/" title="Rubénerd: Total Non Recall">rainbow gelati image</a> into what you see above. A somewhat haunted version of my <a href="http://rubenerd.com/the-shared-experience-of-life-of-brian/" title="Rubénerd: The shared experience of Life of Brian">Life of Brian</a> image <a href="http://files.rubenerd.com/2014/screenie.briantheghost.jpg">was also created</a>.</p>
<p>While common in the dial–up days, I haven&#39;t seen images break like this in a long time. It appears to happen when I close my MacBook Air on WiFi, then wake it from sleep with wired Ethernet.</p>
<p>I&#39;m almost excited to see what pretty art it generates next for us!</p>
