<p>The most common search result for the term is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808">Roland TR-808</a>, an &#8220;rhythm composer&#8221; with a seemingly cult like following:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808">
<p>The Roland TR-808 Rhythm Composer was one of the first programmable drum machines [..]</p>
<p>Introduced by the Roland Corporation in early 1980, it was originally manufactured for use as a tool for studio musicians to create demos. Like earlier Roland drum machines, it does not sound very much like a real drum kit. Indeed, because the TR-808 came out a few months after the Linn LM-1 (the first drum machine to use digital samples), professionals generally considered its sound inferior to sampling drum machines; a 1982 Keyboard Magazine review of the Linn Drum indirectly referred to the TR-808 as sounding like marching anteaters. However, the TR-808 cost US$1,000 upon its release, which was considerably more affordable than the US$5,000 LM-1.</p>
