<p>I&#39;m not entirely sure how true it is, but the legend goes that Sydney is one of the first “large” cities (whatever that means) to get New Years. Images of the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-01-01/australia-ushers-in-2014-with-dazzling-fireworks/5180426" title="ABC News: New Year&#39;s celebrations: Australia ushers in 2014 with dazzling fireworks">Sydney Harbour Bridge erupting in fireworks</a> are broadcast around the world while sleepyheads in later timezones are only just waking up for New Years Eve.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been back in Sydney for a few years now, and have done the firework thing. One year, I went with my old man to Circular Quay and watched from a relatively poor vantage space. Last year, I stood on Vadim&#39;s apartment roof with friends and watched the harbour from there. It was <a href="//rubenerd.com/happy-new-year-2013/" title="Happy New Year, 2013!">very pretty</a>.</p>
<p>This year, I felt as though I&#39;d ticked off <em>“See Sydney Harbour Fireworks”</em> from my list. While fun, being shoved into a mass of drunken people staggering towards Central in the CBD afterwards is somewhat less so. To each their own, but I had little motivation to do it again.</p>
<p>After a day of watching some Hong Kong cinema and playing Wii, <a rel="friend met co-worker kin muse crush date sweetheart" href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> and <a rel="friend met" href="http://alonelyseptember.org/">Seb</a> joined me on a train towards Chatswood. We eagerly watched our smartphones tick down to midnight, then filled the otherwise empty train carriage with <em>Happy New Year!</em> cheer and tweets.</p>
<p>And you know what? It was great! If you&#39;re a quiet person, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t celebrate New Years—or any other obligatory Western tradition—with close friends in your own style.</p>
<p>Peace, health, sillyness and happiness for the new year to you all.</p>
