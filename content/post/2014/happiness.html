<p>Happiness is helping one of your <a href="http://jamiejakov.me/" rel="friend met co-worker">best friends</a> put on a fun Pokémon–themed quest for his girlfriend. Then, retreating with your own <a rel="friend met co-worker kin muse crush date sweetheart" href="http://kirinyan.net/">girlfriend</a> to an <a href="http://www.chryslercafebar.com/" title="Chrysler Cafe Bar Sydney">art deco café</a> for a Cherry Ripe slice and a cup of coffee, with the rain lightly tapping the glass dome above the arcade where you sit.</p>
<p id="happiness-footnote-origin">2014 hasn’t brought much change for me so far, but what it has introduced is more clarity. And with that, a greater appreciation for the luck <a href="#happiness-footnote" title="Footnote #1">&#10122;</a> I do have and the people in my life. Times are challenging, and there are things I wish I had turned out better, but things are just so much better than before.</p>
<p>Happy Sunday.</p>
<p id="happiness-footnote" style="font-style:italic"><a title="Back to the referring text for this footnote" href="#happiness-footnote-origin">&#10122;</a> As a scientist I ascribe fortuitous circumstances to the term luck, but that’s far less succinct and fun to say.</p>
