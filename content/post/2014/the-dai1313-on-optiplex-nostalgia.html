<p>In my <a href="http://rubenerd.com/silent-swap-meets-and-it-nostalgia/" title="Rubénerd: Silent swap meets and IT nostalgia">previous post</a>, I talked about snagging an old IBM ThinkVision LCD and a 2004 Dell Optiplex desktop; the same machiens my school used back in the day.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got a Pentium 4 from my old school in my room. Like actually from the school, grabbed it when they were upgrading to new PC&#39;s. It actually gets a hell of a lot of use. Web, word processing and lots internet radio mostly. If it still works ill put it to use!</p>

<p>Indeed! I&#39;m continually amazed by what can be achieved on so–called crappy or ancient hardware. My first gen Mac Pro flies with Mavericks, and the latest Fedora Linux was a pleasure to use on my ThinkPad X40 and X61 laptops. There&#39;s honest to goodness life left in so many machines that are being thrown away; an internet radio receiver is a great example.</p>
<p>The Pentium 4 was also a real watershed in CPUs and PCs in general. Arguably the crowened winner of the megahertz wars, the P4 was developed for a time when people bought computers based on clock speed.</p>
