<p>I was going through my drafts from a week ago, and I found this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
This afternoon while awaiting the completion of a terribly inefficient PL/SQL query, I found myself staring into space. That kind of distant look where you don’t care if your eyes are even focusing or not; where even the act of blinking seems like a chore. I could almost feel the life energy draining out of me as my MacBook Air SQL Develop’d for its dear life.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes momumtarily [sic] </p>
<p>… and then I woke up.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I have no idea what it was about. It’s utterly pointless, but surreal enough to warrant me publishing it. Maybe you can read between the lines and see something I can’t.</p>
