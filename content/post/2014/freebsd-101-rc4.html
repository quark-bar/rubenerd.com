<p>According to the <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/releases/10.1R/schedule.html">original schedule</a>, FreeBSD 10.1-RELEASE was due out recently. Judging from the newsgroup chatter, there were enough problems to hold back and release an unscheduled <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-stable/2014-November/080872.html">forth release candidate</a>.</p>
<p>10.1 looks great; itâ€™s got a slew of new virtualisation and storage enhancements. More information is on the <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/releases/10.1R/relnotes.html">announcement page</a>.</p>
<p>Get it right and ship when ready guys/girls, we can wait.</p>
