<p style="font-style:italic">(This was updated in May 2015, with newer instructions for 9.310).</p>

<p>It’s good to be back. Had a really terrible stomach flu thing, was out of action for a week. Lots of electrolytes and less solid foods. But that’s not what you tuned in for.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-trials/utm/download.aspx">Sophos Security Gateway</a> (formerly of Astaro fame) comes with a VMware Virtual Appliance. If you want to install on Xen (or another hypervisor) they suggest you can use their regular Software Appliance ISO:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Any other virtualization platforms such as Xen, Hyper-V, KVM, etc. that can boot up from an .iso should operate just fine as well. (Some platforms may not have full support for networking drivers, tools, or time keeping.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The North American convention of putting full stops inside brackets is just crazymaking (but I digress).</p>

<p>If you can, install with Xen using the virtual optical drive. If you’re attempting a bootstrap on a cloud platform (or via USB key), you can first create a hybrid bootable image from the ISO and <code>dd</code> across. The <code>syslinux</code> package contains the <code>isohybrid</code> tool you can use.</p>

<pre>
# apt-get install syslinux
# isohybrid asg-9[x].iso
# dcfldd if=asg-9[x].iso of=/dev/xvda[x]
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this creates a small problem. The installer will boot, but when it gets to the file extraction stage it won’t find the installer files:</p>

<pre>
Install.tar wasn't found on the installation mirror
</pre>

<p>This likely happens because it can’t mount the optical drive as it expects. You can confirm this by dropping to a shell with <code>[ALT]</code>+<code>[F2]</code> and listing the install mountpoint.</p>

<pre>
# ls /install
# ==&gt; crickets
</pre>

<p>Fortunately we’re dealing with Linux, so its relatively easy to mount the installer volume manually. It’ll be different depending on your environment, but if you imaged to a second Xen drive, try <strong><em>one</em></strong> of these likely options:</p>

<pre>
# mount /dev/xvda2 /install
# mount /dev/sda1 /install
</pre>

<p>Then hit <code>[ALT]</code>+<code>[F1]</code> (not <code>[F2]</code>) and proceed as normal. Again depending on your environment, you may even see this:</p>

<pre>
Extra RPMs are installed for improved Xen HVM support.
</pre>

<p>Boom!</p>
