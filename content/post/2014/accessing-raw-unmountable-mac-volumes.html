<p>This evening I had to repair a family external hard drive. To run a few of my repair and recovery tools, I needed to give QEMU raw disk access to the drive on my Mac. Usually, this is a fairly easy task:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plug in the external drive</li>
<li>Use “<code>diskutil list</code>” to find the device identifier</li>
<li>Unmount with “<code>hdiutil unmount /dev/diskX</code>”</li>
<li>Launch QEMU with “<code>-hda /dev/diskX</code>”</li>
</ol>
<p>The same could be done in <a href="//rubenerd.com/booting-physical-drive-virtualbox/">VirtualBox using raw disk images</a>.</p>
<p>In this case though, the volume was so badly corrupted that OS X got caught in a loop trying to mount it when the drive was plugged in. Manually mounting and unmounting didn’t work, and the system maintained a lock on the device.</p>
<p>There were several possible solutions, but I chose just to prevent that particilar drive automounting. First, find the UUID of the affected drive partition in question, where X is the drive and Y is the partition number:</p>
<pre>
$ diskutil info /dev/diskXsY
</pre>
<p>Then add the following to the legendary “<code>/etc/fstab</code>” file, substituting the file system if you’re dealing with others. Newer versions of OS X don’t include the file by default, but still respect it if you create one:</p>
<pre>
$ sudo echo 'UUID=[from diskutil] none hfs rw,noauto' >> /etc/fstab
</pre>
<p>With that, I was able to plug the affected drive in, launch QEMU and be on my way.</p>
