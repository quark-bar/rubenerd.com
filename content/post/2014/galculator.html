<p>My production machine at work is a <a href="https://debian.org/">Debian</a> box, so I&#39;ve been relearning all the <em>Year of the Linux Desktop</em> things. I couldn&#39;t remember what I used to use as my RPN <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Fatboy+Slim+Weapon+of+Choice">weapon of choice</a>, but a quick apt-cache search found me this <a href="http://galculator.sourceforge.net/" title="galculator, a GTK+ calculator">rather handsome</a> little unit by Simon Floery.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re in <em>Scientific Mode</em>, you can just click <code>RPN</code> in the display. Otherwise, choose <em>Reverse Polish</em> from <em>Notation Modes</em> on the surprisingly‚Äêtitled <em>Calculator</em> menu.</p>
<p>Update: Turns out that RPN calculator I used to use was the <a href="//rubenerd.com/hp-bevels-and-xcalc/">venerable xcalc</a>. That could be activated in RPN mode, and themed. How very retro, and meta.</p>
