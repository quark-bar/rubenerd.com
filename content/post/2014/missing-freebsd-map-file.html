<p>Today I learned FreeBSD can’t lodge email reports for root if aliases.db was never created, either in bsdinstall or your jail.</p>
<p>Long story short, I was seeing this after sudo-ing into a new instance:</p>
<pre>
[date] [hostname] sudo: [user]: user NOT in sudoers ; [..]
</pre>
<p>Heh, my bad. But then this appeared:</p>
<pre>
SYSERR(root): hash map "Alias0": missing map file /etc/mail/aliases.db
No such file or directory
</pre>
<p>Huh. So just to try, I &#8220;created&#8221; the file thusly:</p>
<pre>
# touch /etc/mail/aliases.db
</pre>
<p>Needless to say, that didn’t work! The solution, ironically from some ancient <a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/securing/chap22sec179.html">Red Hat docs</a>:</p>
<pre>
# makemap hash /etc/mail/aliases.db < /etc/mail/aliases
</pre>
<p>This command must be run after creating an <code>/etc/mail/aliases</code> file. You also need to run it if you make any changes.</p>
<p>Happy long weekend!</p>
