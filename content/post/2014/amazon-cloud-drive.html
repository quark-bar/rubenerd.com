<p>On a whim, I gave Amazon Cloud Drive a quick test. Launched in 2011, the service promises 5.0GB of free storage accessible from Windows, Mac and the browser.</p>
<p>After a day or so of usage, I&#39;ve decided I&#39;ll be sticking with Dropbox for my for my public documents and encrypted sparsebundles. There are many reasons, but these are the most presient:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The web interface is familiar and easy for people used to Amazon&#39;s design language, but its not as slick as Dropbox. It also requires Flash to upload files, in 2013.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The provided Mac client defaults to putting files in your home folder. There&#39;s no way to change this in the interface of the application, short of creating a symlink in the terminal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dropbox (like S3) can have public folders, with any file placed in it being accessible. With Cloud Drive, files must be individually shared, and a UID unrelated to the filename is created.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It was worth a try, but I feel Amazon has the capability of doing much better. </p>
