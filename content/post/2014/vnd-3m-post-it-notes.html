<p>Going through `/etc/mime.types` this afternoon, I discovered a delightful little gem:</p>
<pre>
application/vnd.3M.Post-it-Notes
</pre>
<p>The only reference to it I could find was a 1997 request for its <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.3M.Post-it-Notes">MIME application</a>. Of interest:</p>
<pre>
MIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.3M.Post-it-Notes  
Applications which use this media :  
Post-it Software Notes v1.5+  
</pre>
<p>Now that I think of it, my old man bought and used this with his Windows NT machines back in the day. They were rather cute.</p>
<p>Other information was decidely less helpful:</p>
<pre>
Required parameters : 3M Confidential

Optional parameters : 
3M Confidential

Encoding considerations : 
3M Confidential

Security considerations : 
Independent evaluation impossible due to specification non-disclosure.
