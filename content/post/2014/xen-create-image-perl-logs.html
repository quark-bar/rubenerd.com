<p>A problem when loading xen-create-image</p>
<pre>
Log::Message will be removed from the Perl core distribution in the 
next major release. Please install the separate liblog-message-perl 
package. It is being used at /usr/share/perl5/Log/Message/Simple.pm,
line 5.
</pre>
<p>Installing from apt-get:</p>
<pre>
apt-get install liblog-message-perl
</pre>
<p>New problem:</p>
<pre>
Package liblog-message-perl is not available, but is referred to by
another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been
obsoleted, or is only available from another source
However the following packages replace it:
  perl-modules
</pre>
<p>Attempt 2:</p>
<pre>
apt-get install perl-modules

==&gt; perl-modules is already the newest version.
</pre>
<p>Turns out, itâ€™s a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=724532">bug</a>. Darn.</p>
