<p>Yes, I make it a habit of using older versions of logos if they were superior to the new ones. Case in point, ironically, <a href="//rubenerd.com/is-java-dying/">Java</a>.</p>

<p>In what probably never would have happened under the first two CEOs to lead the historic software company, Microsoft plans to announce on Wednesday that it is open sourcing the entire .NET framework, a symbolic move by the Redmond, Washington-based legacy technology company officially recognizing that the open-source model of software development is here to stay.</p>

Today, Scott Guthrie announced that Microsoft is open sourcing .NET. This is a momentous occasion, and one that I have advocated for many years.

<blockquote cite="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/11/12/net-core-is-open-source.aspx">
<p>Today is a huge day for .NET! We’re happy to announce that .NET Core will be open source, including the runtime as well as the framework libraries.</p>

<p>Hmm, .NET Core? Let’s ask living Microsoft institution <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-to-open-source-more-of-net-and-bring-it-to-linux-mac-os-x-7000035716/">Mary Jo Foley</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-to-open-source-more-of-net-and-bring-it-to-linux-mac-os-x-7000035716/">
<p>Microsoft is not planning to open source the client side .NET stack, which means it won’t be open sourcing libraries specific to the client such as Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Windows Forms, Somasegar confirmed.</p>

<p>So <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines">Betteridge’s law of headlines</a> shamelessly still in effect, at least here.</p>
