<p>I’ve come to accept that I develop odd affinities for my electronics. I tend to use the same devices till they either completely fall apart, or when something really game changing appears. They’re my primary creative outlets, and I love them.</p>
<p>This 27 inch (68.6cm!) Retina iMac is a qualifying game changing device.</p>
<p>Since the iPhone 4, Retina screen fans have waited with baited breath for this theorised Apple desktop that could give us the same font clarity and photographic detail in a large display. <strong>Retina screens are achingly beautiful</strong>, and I’m absolutely pedantic enough to appreciate every tiny detail. If you’re not, well, what can I say.</p>
<p>The new Mac Pro gave us the first glimmer of hope of a Retina desktop. I pictured my ideal setup of a modestly spec’d Mac Pro and a ViewSonic 3840&#215;2400 display, but a quick look at a release timeframe and the expected cost would bring me down to earth.</p>
<p>With a Retina iMac, we could bump the specs up and still be cheaper than the Mac Pro alone, let alone one with a separate Retina display. It also has the benefit of existing as a solution, today.</p>

<p>I’d likely be fine with the base specs, but the 4.0GHz i7 looks to be an amazing CPU. I’d also prefer to throw as much grunt behind such a gargantuan display as I could. If I had to compromise, I’d probably stick with the i5 with the 4GiB GPU. The SSD is the same price as a Fusion Drive, and I’ve got enough storage in my NASs (NASii?).</p>
<p>Now with its unbuffered consumer grade parts, the Retina iMac is no Mac Pro replacement. But for those of us looking for a Retina desktop, this is what we’ve been waiting for. It may even be enough for me to give up my own rule of never buying version 1 Apple devices.</p>
<p>Now all it needs is a <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:IMac_G3_blueberry_back.jpg">handle</a>, so I could ferry it between home and the office.</p>
