<p>Here in Australia, we had a government that not only acknowledged the climate change issue, but implemented an emissions trading scheme and a price on carbon. Then we voted in a conservative government on a platform of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/18/us-australia-carbon-vote-idUSKBN0FM04J20140718">&#8220;repealing the carbon tax&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>And then this happened. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/nov/12/australia-emissions-target-extreme-pressure-us-china-deal">Lenore Taylor, writing for The Guardian</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Australia is under intense pressure to announce a target for post-2020 greenhouse gas reductions after the shock announcement from US president Barack Obama and Chinese premier Xi Jinping of new national climate change goals.</p>
<p>The US has agreed to cut its emissions by 26-28% of 2005 levels by 2025 – a doubling of the pace of its reductions. If Australia were to make similar cuts by 2025 against its 2000 benchmark, it would need to reduce emissions by between 28% and 31%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the line Twitter is buzzing about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Asked where the deal left Australia’s climate change policy, the expert adviser to the former government Professor Ross Garnaut said: “Exactly where it was before the US-China announcement – up shit creek.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No question, our Prime Minister has made Australia a pariah in the global scientific and environmental communities. Worse still, we’ll be living with his cabinet’s short sightedness for years.</p>
