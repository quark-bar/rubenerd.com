<p>While testing some FreeBSD package management goodness, I wondered what it would take to host a pkgng mirror.</p>
<p>For those unversed, pkgng is FreeBSD’s new binary package manager, designed to replace pkg_add and other such tools. I <a href="//rubenerd.com/pkgin-pkgng-pkgwin/">blogged with excitement</a> about the system; along with NetBSD’s pkgin; at the time they were announced.</p>
<p>I haven’t got far in finding out what you need to do to register yourself as a mirror, though I did copy and paste the web package table for <a href="http://pkg.freebsd.org/freebsd:10:x86:64/latest/All/">FreeBSD 10 x86_64</a> into LibreOffice. Which gave me a spinning cursor then crashed after twenty minutes.</p>
<p>So I copied the table into Gnumeric, which accepted the tabular data in about five seconds.</p>
<p>According to a simple sum, you’d be looking at 40.25GiB, or 43,219,644,432 bytes to host a pkgng mirror, assuming the x86_64 architecture.</p>
<p>The more you know.</p>
