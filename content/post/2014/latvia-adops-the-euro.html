<p>I saw on Wikipedia this morning that Latvia is joining Estonia in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvia_and_the_euro" title="Wikipedia: Latvia and the euro">adopting the Euro</a>. While I&#39;ve long since stopped studying economics, I love coins and decided to check them out. They&#39;re pretty swish, while still keeping some of the classy elements of the previous mintage. Most fittingly, the 1€ and 2€ coins include <em>The Maiden</em>, arguably one of the most well know symbols of modern Latvia to those of us from the outside.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the country in general. Given its remote location compared to anywhere I grew up, this tiny Baltic nation has had a surprising influence on my family. Our dearest family friends whom Elke and I consider family are Latvian and German. When I was a <em>vexillologically obsessed</em> kid, I wanted a Latvian flag for my room given it did away with the predictable colours most flags used. I had a Baltic map from a National Geographic magazine on my wall for years. To give the markers a break from reading about Australia and Singapore, I wrote my year 10–12 commerce and economics papers on Latvia and Lithuania. Mr. Webb and Mr. Rogers at the <a href="http://www.ais.com.sg/">AIS</a> are my witnesses!</p>
<p>Since moving back to Sydney, the Latvian influence has only intensified. Half my networking gear now comes from their <a href="http://routerboard.com/">world–renowned engineers</a>. One of my <a href="http://jamiejakov.me" rel="met friend">best friends</a>, the first I made at UTS, and the reason why I&#39;m in <a href="http://utsanime.net/">Anime@UTS</a>, is a Latvian. When I lived in Earlwood and commuted on the Airport Line, I helped not one but two groups of Latvian tourists at different times, more than any other group of Europeans.</p>
<p>One day Clara and I will go there, and spend us some Latvian Euro with our <a href="http://jamiejakov.me" rel="met friend">official tour guide</a> :).</p>
