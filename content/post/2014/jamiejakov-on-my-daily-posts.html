<p><a href="https://twitter.com/JamieJakov/status/441768556498137088">@JamieJakov made an observation</a> about my daily post challenge:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/JamieJakov/status/441768556498137088"><p>@Rubenerd you missed making a post on the 4th of March! Make one nau!</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ll admit I did want to do <a title="RubÃ©nerd: Post a Day 2014" href="http://rubenerd.com/post-a-day-2014/">#PostADay2014</a>; however unreliable internet and mental exhaustion after long days have had other plans. For those who need it spelled out, those were excuses ;).</p>
<p>Given the reality of my life right now, I&#39;ll still be <em>aiming</em> to write a daily post. If something extraordinary comes up that stops me from doing so though, I won&#39;t lose sleep over it. Well okay, that&#39;s a lie, but I&#39;ll attempt to feel okay about it!</p>
<p>A quick <code>ls -1 | wc -l</code> in my Jekyll posts folder shows I&#39;ve written seventy two posts this year, and have missed three.</p>
