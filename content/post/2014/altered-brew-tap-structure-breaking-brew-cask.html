<p><a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> recently changed the way taps are identified. Or more specifically, after running an update:</p>
<pre class="code">
Warning: Homebrew changed the structure of Taps like &lt;someuser&gt;/&lt;sometap&gt;.
</pre>
<p>For example, the first shows the location of brew cask on my <abbr title="MacBook Air">MBA</abbr>, the second on my Mac Pro. I’ll admit, I get a kick out of calling my Air a <abbr title="MacBook Air">MBA</abbr>; but I digress.</p>
<pre class="code">
phinze/cask
caskroom/cask
</pre>
<p>This causes issues when attempting to search for a cask. On my un–updated <abbr title="MacBook Air">MBA</abbr>:</p>
<pre class="code">
$ brew cask search gnucash
==> Exact match
gnucash
</pre>
<p>And on my updated Mac Pro:</p>
<pre class="code">
% brew cask search gnucash
No cask found for "gnucash"
</pre>
<p>Last week, WyseNynga <a title="Github: brew 0.9.5 changed tap directory structure and now no casks are found #4026" href="https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/4026">identified the issue</a> on Github, with floriankubis suggesting creating a symlink to bridge the old/new folders. This comment thread has since been closed, with rolandwalker identifying that brew-cask needs to be upgraded in response to this change:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s a new code release &#8212; brew update &amp;&amp; brew upgrade brew-cask should fix the problem.</p>
<p>For various reasons, the symlink trick only partially worked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For reasons beyond me, upgrading as suggested didn’t work. In fact, it generated the same errors that would occur when brew-cask hadn’t even been installed:</p>
<pre>
$ brew cask search gnucash
Error: can't convert nil into String
Please report this bug:

https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/troubleshooting

/usr/local/Library/brew.rb:64:in `require'
/usr/local/Library/brew.rb:64:in `require?'
/usr/local/Library/brew.rb:111
</pre>
<p>In this case, uninstalling and reinstalling seemed to do the trick:</p>
<pre>
$ brew uninstall brew-cask
$ brew install brew-cask
$ brew cask search gnucash
==> Exact match
gnucash
</pre>
<p>Homebrew is a promising package manager for OS X, but its pre-1.0 version is demonstrated by such changes. It seems we have a ways to go before sysadmins can get the same (relatively) stable package system we have on our Linux boxes.</p>
