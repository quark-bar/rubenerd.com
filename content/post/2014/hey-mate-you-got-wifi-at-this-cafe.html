<p>Whether it’s Dr Grant Mooney from UTS, or some weird guy writing a blog, some of us just get more work done in coffee shops. I’ve attempted to pontificate on the reasons why over many a year here, but I’ve long since given up.</p>
<p>While working at a coffee shop recently:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See, this tool on his laptop, there isn’t even WiFi here</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Normally I ignore these flippant remarks. To mess with them though, I put my browser full screen and started loading a ton of pages. It must have caught their attention:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Hey mate, you got WiFi here?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I could have said I was tethered to the phone in my pocket but… </p>
<blockquote><p>
Yeah, pretty good for a tool, huh?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now to be fair&#8230; nah, let’s not be this time.</p>
