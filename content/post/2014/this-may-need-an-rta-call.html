<p>So I finally got my new photo card yesterday from the RTA, or RMS, or whatever they’re calling themselves thesedays. Email from earlier today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Customer,</p>
<p>You have recently provided your details to sign-up to Online Services.</p>
<p>To get started, go to www.rms.nsw.gov.au/onlineservices and log in using the details below.</p>
<p>Once logged in, you’ll be asked to create a new password and update all your account details.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clicking the link took me to the generic homepage for the NSW Road and Maritime Services. Logging in with these provided details:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The details you’ve entered are not consistent with our records. Please check your details and try again.
</p></blockquote>
<p>For my American readers, this is my state government’s equivalent to your <abbr title="Department of Motor Vehicles">DMV</abbr>. Sounds like we haven’t figured out things much better than you all have.</p>
