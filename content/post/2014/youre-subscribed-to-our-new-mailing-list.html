<p>For reasons I can&#39;t penny fathom, the new black is taking the email addresses of all your customers, and subscribing them to your newfangled email newsletters they neither wanted, nor ever requested.</p>
<p>Take this one from Wikia, sent earlier last month:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Welcome to Wikia&#39;s debut newsletter from The Social Universe for Fans, by Fans. </p>
<p>Every month, we&#39;re going to promote and feature your fan chronicles, offering you a quick resource for everything that&#39;s happening in fandom, from movies, TV, games, comics, lifestyle, books and music.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or this vague one from MechKB:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are receiving this e-mail because you have previously subscribed to the MechKB newsletter mailing list and/or you have previously purchased from us. Starting from today we aim to send out an e-mail like this once a week / fortnight with various updates and interesting tid-bits about Mechanical Keyboards and, of course, the latest updates and offers from MechKB.com.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, such newsletters are quick to reassure us that we can unsubscribe. This one from Wikia, emphasis <strong>not</strong> added by me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&#39;re not interested in receiving this fandom-filled newsletter each month, <strong>you can change your email preferences at the bottom of this email</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And MechKB (it&#39;s just so easy!):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you do not wish to receive these e-mails, unsubscribing is easy. Simply scroll down to the bottom of this e-mail and click &quot;unsubscribe from this list.&quot; You can do this in future at any time. Otherwise, scroll down to have a look at what we have in mind. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t mean to pick unfairly on just these two companies, everyone from PayPal to my bank is doing it. I also happen to really like their sites, and am using a keyboard purchased from MechKB. The irony isn&#39;t lost on me that this newsletter email rant has also given them free publicity.</p>
<p>That said, if I were on the fence or indifferent about a service or site, these opt-out email newsletters may be enough to push me over the edge and take my business or data-minable social activities elsewhere.</p>
<p>Whoever is advising companies to abuse their email lists like this, please stop for the good of humanity and all that we hold dear.</p>
