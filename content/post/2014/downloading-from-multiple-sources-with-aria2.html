<p>Of course, the fine <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/10.0R/announce.html" title="FreeBSD 10.0 RELEASE announcement and release notes">FreeBSD folks released 10.0</a> while our <a href="http://rubenerd.com/the-sound-of-pppoe-silence/" title="Rubénerd: The sound of PPPoE silence">internet has ceased to exist</a>, or pushing up daisies, as it were. Stuck with the spotty internet of our local café and public library, I <strong>needed</strong> to find a way to download this latest release. Yes, <strong>needed</strong> is the appropriate operative word, thank you very much.</p>
<p>The solution came in the form of <a href="http://aria2.sourceforge.net/">aria2</a>, which is conveniently available via <a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/aria2.rb" title="aria2 formula in Homebrew">Homebrew</a> and for <a href="https://www.freshports.org/www/aria2/">FreeBSD</a>. As well as being able to resume downloads with the same command you used to start the initial download, you can supply multiple sources:</p>
<pre>
% aria2c http://tabasco/freebsd10.iso 

http://tomato/freebsd10.iso


http://barbecue/freebsd10.iso

  ftp://soy/freebsd10.iso
</pre>
<p>Using this, I was able to roughly double my download speed, and even resume the download when <a rel="friend met co-worker kin muse crush date sweetheart" href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> and I moved from the library to coffee shop. <strong>Very</strong> nice!</p>
