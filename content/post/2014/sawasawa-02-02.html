<p>My American friends and I usually differ in how we write our dates. Once a month though, we&#39;re able to cast aside our chronometric differences and celebrate a date that&#39;s perfectly valid in both our systems. Today we have 02/02/2014.</p>
<p>Not keen to let my <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1099/" title="Rubénerd: I&#39;m 22, but I won&#39;t wear one!">terrible 22 tutu pun die</a>, I naturally hit the anime image boards in the hopes of finding some tutu art to share here this evening. Among the surprisingly sparse offerings, I was delighted to see another post from the artist sawasawa.</p>
<p>What sawasawa was able to do with monochramatic pencil blended with just a<br />
few precious colours was really something special. A few of their posts were<br />
a little ecchi (or <em>risqué</em> in the old language), but were never tasteless.</p>
<p>Sadly, their original site has long since been lost in the 404 ether, though I&#39;ve since been told they have a pixiv account now. It&#39;s my hope more of their earlier work makes it there eventually.</p>
