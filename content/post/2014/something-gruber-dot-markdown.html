<p>Generally speaking (for the pendants), the current way we identify files on desktop OSs is filename extensions. It didn&#39;t used to be this way Smithers, many OSs including Mac OS and *nix could identify files without them. Another unfortunate legacy of having to support Windows.</p>
<p>This morning our time, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/01/08/markdown-extension" title="Daring Fireball: The Markdown File Extension">John Gruber elaborated</a> on the lack of an official Markdown filename extension. He endorses &quot;.markdown&quot;, agreeing with <a href="http://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/07/the-markdown-file-extension/" title="The Markdown File Extension">Hilton Lipschitz</a> that &quot;we should be using the most descriptive file extensions&quot;.</p>
<p>I can empathise, but I employ &quot;.md&quot; precisely because it&#39;s succinct. <em>NetsecReport.md</em> is more useful to me than <em>Netsec&#8230;ort.markdown</em> as viewed in the Finder&#39;s column view, or TextMate&#39;s file browser.</p>
<p>This does create a little more work for us developing software, but I see this flexibility as a strength of this plain text format, rather than a weakness.</p>
