<p>Happy Sunday everyone. Today I reached the rather inglorious milestone of having a hundred drafts. For 2014. Rather than attempt to fix these up for posting, have an image I took this afternoon of the sunshine in Sydney.</p>
<p>Singapore will always be my home and I miss it dearly, but nowhere on Earth has skies as beautiful as Australia. Absolutely spectacular.</p>
<p>This also marks two posts in a row of Australian skies. Better make the next one tie back into anime again, somehow.</p>
