<p>This afternoon, <a rel="friend met co-worker kin muse crush date sweetheart" href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> and I headed to the <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/museums/index.shtml">University of Sydney Museum</a> to check out their <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/museums/exhibitions-events/lego-acropolis.shtml">LEGO Acropolis exhibit</a>. Hey floor, I heard you like jaw!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following on from the extraordinary success of the LEGO Colosseum in 2012, the Brickman, Ryan McNaught,<br />
has turned his hand to one of the most iconic architectural monuments of Ancient Greece â€“ the Acropolis!</p>
<p>The LEGO model displays the Acropolis both as it was in the fifth century BC and as it is today, as one of<br />
Greece&#39;s most popular tourist attractions. Captured in LEGO are some of the Acropolis&#39; more famous<br />
visitors including Pericles, Lord Elgin, Dame Agatha Christie, and even Elton John.</p>

<p>Beside the stunning model were tables and chairs with LEGO bricks. Naturally, Clara and I proceeded to spend the early evening building. Clara built a flying house; and I attempted my own Greek building. You can view our efforts (and theirs!) in my <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/sets/72157639301659906/">Flickr gallery</a>.</p>
