<p>I&#39;ve had a semblance of a responsive design on my sites for a while, but scaling images continued to elude me. I&#39;ve always defined the height and width of images, meaning previous attempts at inline scaling resulted in some warped and stretched images.</p>
<p>With some help from <a rel="friend met co-worker kin muse crush date sweetheart" href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a>, I discovered <em>Rub√©nerd</em> specifically needed the following lines (your mileage may vary):</p>
<pre>#content img {
  height:auto !important;
  max-height:auto !important;
  max-width:100%;
}</pre>
<p>Now images, such as <a href="http://penguincoffee.net/post/72084908076/better-credited-dream-c-club">this Railgun image</a> by <em>Dream C Club</em>, will preserve their aspect ratio while scaling up and down. Whether it will improve karaoke abilities is another question.</p>
