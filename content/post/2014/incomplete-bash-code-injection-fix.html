<p>The #bashbleed #shellshock fix <a href="//rubenerd.com/bash-code-injection-vulnerability/">we got yesterday</a> was only a partial. <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-7169">CVE-7169</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="">
<p>GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-025 processes trailing strings after certain malformed function definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote attackers to write to files or possibly have unknown other impact via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients, and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a privilege boundary from Bash execution. <em>NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Update bash on your boxes again, or if you can’t, shut down SSH and block it with your firewall rules.</strong></p>
<p>Also, don’t reinstall bash on FreeBSD. Make tcsh your friend, as many on Twitter told me they have yesterday. It really is quite a nice interactive shell, and you’ve always got sh for scripts.</p>
