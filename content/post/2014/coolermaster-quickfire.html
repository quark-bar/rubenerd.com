<p>With a sudden influx of uni work, my search for the ultimate second computer keyboard had taken a back seat. A most regrettable situation, given that very keyboard could have been used to do the aforementioned work!</p>
<p>Last week, the lovely proprietor of <a href="http://the.geekorium.com.au/">The Geekorium</a> pointed me to this CoolerMaster keyboard, the <a href="https://www.pccasegear.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&#038;cPath=113_1294&#038;products_id=22092">QuickFire Cherry Blue Mech</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>QuickFire TK takes the QuickFire Rapid and put it on steroids! Cherry Blue keys with blue LED illumination. Each keycap is UV coated to make it durable. There’s full LED backlighting with 3 modes and 5 brightness levels. NKRO over USB means every single keystroke will be registered. An embedded steel plate give you maximum stability and durability. 7 easy-access multimedia shortcut keys save time. A complete numpad lets you get work done while not gaming. The slim and lightweight size gives you plenty of room for your mouse. Great for LAN parties.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a unique twist that I haven’t seen in a keyboard before, they incorporated the PigUp/PigDown and cursor keys into the numeric keypad. I’d mentioned previously I didn’t really need the latter keys, but its an interesting compromise.</p>
<p>Another feature I like is the slim chassis; really we don’t need anything more than this to cramp our desks. Well okay, I’d love to have a giant, hulking <a href="http://pckeyboard.com/page/UKBD/UB4044A">Unicomp Classic</a>, but I’m also working with far less space.</p>
<p>The switches are Cherry MX Blues which I’ve heard good things about. Given I want to use this for the times of day where my buckling spring would be too loud though, I’m still on the lookout for either Browns or those elusive Clears. Their tactile bumps are supposed to offer similar feedback with less noise.</p>
<p>Overall an interesting keyboard, and may be right up your alley if you want those baby blues. Otherwise, the search continues!</p>
