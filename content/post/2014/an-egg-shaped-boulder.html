<p>With the holiday season coming to a close, I decided to hit the anime image boards for some inspiring new art for my January background. What I saw ended up making me think.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://konachan.net/post/show/168494/">that image above</a>? Drawn by Inoki-08 and <a href="http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=30168407">uploaded to Pixiv</a>, it depicts an ocean scene with what appears to a dog playing with his owner. In front of them in the distance, we see a monstrously huge, egg shaped boulder with intricate carvings on its surface. </p>
<p>How did they come up with that? Or more pressing for me personally, how did they translate that abstract concept in their head into something concrete? How did they <strong>draw</strong> that?</p>
<p>As many of my fellow IT women and men do, I design software, write code and maintain systems with admittedly cryptic commands; most of which probably look like gibberish to most people. I&#39;ve gradually tried to convince myself over the years that this is how I&#39;m &quot;creative&quot;. And yet, seeing this image… it&#39;s humbling. Had I spent hundreds of hours in front of a paint brush, or a graphics tablet, I could have never drawn something like this. Or <a href="http://kirinyan.net/nyan-nyan-nyan-nyan-nyancat-mascot/">mascots</a>. Or calligraphy. Even if I possessed sufficient skill, I doubt I could have come up with something so fantastic.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been using the term &quot;humbling&quot; a lot over the last year. I guess a sign of getting older is the gradual appreciation of just how much is really out there. At the risk of ending on a cliché, the more we learn, the more we realise how little we know.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and artists will forever intimidate me.</p>
