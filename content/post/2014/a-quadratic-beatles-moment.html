<p>I was far too old for the coin to drop with regards to a certain Liverpudlian band. In my mid–teens, I was looking an album cover and realised&#8230; hey, wait a minute&#8230; they&#39;re the <em>BEAT–LES</em>. It blew my mind. Then the embarrassment set in, like finally getting a joke someone told you a long time ago.</p>
<p>Recently, I solved another etymological quandary from my childhood. During maths, I&#39;d wondered why they were called <em>quadratic equations</em> if we were dealing with raising things to the power of <em>two</em>. Doesn&#39;t quad mean four? As in, the number of Beatles?</p>
<p>As we all should have expected, the English Language and Usage Stack Exchange (there was such a thing?) <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/151217/why-does-quadratic-describe-second-power-while-quad-usually-describes-four" title="Stack Exchange: Why does “quadratic” describe second power while “quad” usually describes “four”?">answered this question</a>. First, we have Peter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does &quot;quadratic&quot; describe second power while &quot;quad&quot; usually describes &quot;four&quot;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the most succinct response, from RegDwigнt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the second power is a square, and a square has four sides. In fact the word square itself comes from quad-, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But of course. What a blockhead.</p>
<p>As for the cover, it seemed the most logical one to include in a post such as this, even if the titular song wasn&#39;t sung or written by my beloved George. Speaking words of wisdom?</p>
