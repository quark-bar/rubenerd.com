<p>I’ve used and adored TextExpander since hearing Dan and Merlin discuss it on <a title="BackToWork on the almighty 5by5" href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/">Back to Work</a>.</p>
<p>By defining snippets, you can substitute whole blocks of text or forms with a keystroke shortcut. For example, <code>;me</code> is replaced with my name, email address and phone number. <code>;i</code> gets replaced with an img HTML tag complete with image dimensions and a field for alt text. It’s really nice.</p>
<p>For my student friends though, its been hard to recommend a $35 application. If this is a limiting factor, I’ve since found a promising alternative called <a href="https://www.trankynam.com/atext/">aText</a>. It appears to perform a subset of TextExpander’s tasks, for $5.</p>
<p>I adore TextExpander, but if you’re on a tight budget AText may be the way to go.</p>
