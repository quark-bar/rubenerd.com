<p>In lighter news, <a rel="friend met co-worker kin muse crush date sweetheart" href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> and I managed to snag a copy of the next installment of The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki–Chan! The full sized image is <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/12587716795/" title="Flickr: Yuki-Chan Volume 5">on my Flickr</a>.</p>
<p>We&#39;ve seen quite the progression of covers, from a shy and blushing Yuki, to one with more confidence. This time around, she seems almost indifferent to our presence. Without becoming a spoiler, these broadly follow Yuki&#39;s own journey in the series; both Clara and I like what they did in the covers to illustrate this.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve yet to take the wrapping off; I&#39;m not at bag and boarding levels of obsessiveness over this character, though I may be precariously close to it. Then again, who would need to do that when they&#39;re lucky enough to be <a rel="friend met co-worker kin muse crush date sweetheart" href="http://kirinyan.net/">dating her</a>? </p>
