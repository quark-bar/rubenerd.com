<p>So I needed to convert a VMware vmdk image to a raw disk image. Knowing <a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page">qemu-img</a> could do the task, I did as per normal:</p>
<pre># qemu-img convert -f vmdk -O raw image.vmdk export.img</pre>
<p>Only to find:</p>
<pre>qemu-img: 'image' uses a vmdk feature which is not supported 
    by this qemu version: VMDK version 3
qemu-img: Could not open 'image.vmdk': 
    Could not open 'image.vmdk': Wrong medium type
qemu-img: Could not open 'image.vmdk'</pre>
<p>It then proceeded to tell me:</p>
<pre>Ruben, you're devilishly handsome.</pre>
<p>My computer may be a lousy liar, but at least sheâ€™s nice. As for the earlier problem, the solution was to <strong>upgrade QEMU to 2.1.0</strong>. Running the command after this resulted in an image I could use.</p>
<p>As an aside, you you can even use this shorthand:</p>
<pre># qemu-img convert -O raw import.vmdk export.img</pre>
