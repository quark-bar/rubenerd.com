<p><a href="http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=41616963" title="Art by hews on Pixiv">Not that kind of date</a>, unless you&#39;re a fan of shipping characters in such a manner. But I digress.</p>
<p>The evolving HTML5 spec never ceases to surprise. Today, I learned this while validating some pages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Line 29, Column 57: Bad value date for attribute name on element meta: Keyword date is not registered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the following generic HTML meta attributes are <a href="http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/MetaExtensions" title="WhatWG Wiki: Meta Extensions">all still valid</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>author</code></li>
<li><code>description</code></li>
<li><code>generator</code></li>
<li><code>keywords</code></li>
</ul>
<p>But <code>date</code> isn&#39;t. <strong>What</strong>WG indeed.</p>
<p>I suspect there was a discussion at some point discussing what exactly it means. Is it when a page was created, or modified, or certain parts were created or modified?</p>
<h3>An equally valid, ambiguous replacement</h3>
<p>Whatever the case, we need to replace our simple date attributes with something else. My first hunch was to use the Dublin Core <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-created">created attribute</a> with a schema link. You could also use RDFa with a property tag.</p>
<pre>
&lt;link rel="schema.dcterms" href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" /&gt;
&lt;meta name="dcterms.created" content="2014-02-17T23:43:43+1100" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>As the term &quot;created&quot; suggests however, it&#39;s designed to be static. Unfortunately, Jekyll dervives timestamps from the file, which means it changes with each update. I store my own timestamps which override these, so maybe the key would be to use the Jekyll as date modified, and my own timestamp as date created.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if this is even possible, unless I broke out some more custom Jekyll frontmatter to store a distinct creation date. I suppose it <a href="http://rubenerd.com/jekyll-timezones/" title="RubÃ©nerd: Jekyll timezones">wouldn&#39;t be the first time</a> I&#39;ve done something like that.</p>
<p>While I decide what to do, I&#39;ve settled on the more ambiguous <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-date">date  attribute</a>, to get exactly what we had before:</p>
<pre>
&lt;meta name="dcterms.date" content="2014-02-17T23:43:43+1100" /&gt;
</pre>
<p>I wonder what will be deprecated next?</p>
