<p>I had quite the disconcerting experience this afternoon. Walking with <a rel="friend met co-worker kin muse crush date sweetheart" href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> to grab some coffee, I made a quick stop at an ATM to withdraw the required funds that would allow us to sit at a café. <a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF28PETSYFE" title="Fatboy Slim, Weapon of Choice video on YouTube">A café of choice</a>.</p>
<p>I put the card in as per normal, but then stared at the keypad blankly for a few moments. Despite years of entering it, for some reason at that specific moment I had no idea what my PIN was. I entered what vaguely seemed familiar, and the ATM allowed me to proceed.</p>
<p>Having selected my required amount and account, I eagerly awaited the slivers of thin plastic our society has deemed to be worth exchanging for goods and services. In our case, gelati and coffee. And no autocorrect, I did not mean gelatin!</p>
<p id="total-non-recall-para-1"><em>“I’m afraid I can’t let you do that Ruben”</em>, said the ATM in a decidedly HAL–like tone of voice (<a href="#total-non-recall-footnote-1" title="Footnote 1">footnote #1</a>). As I feared, I’d entered an incorrect PIN.</p>
<p>I tried it again, and still couldn&#39;t remember. Again, the ATM reported an incorrect PIN. Rather than risk it eating my card, I cancelled the transaction.</p>
<p>An hour or so later, Clara and I were enjoying our coffee and gelati, procured with our pooled shrapnel reserves. As I was otherwise occupied playing cards, the PIN appeared in my mind, as if it were a fluorescent neon tube glowing so bright its light burned into my eyes.</p>
<p>The number seemed so <strong>obvious</strong>. You&#39;ve been typing it for years Ruben, of course you&#39;d remember it!</p>
<p>Yet… why couldn&#39;t I remember it before? What was it about my circumstance that was different from all the other times I&#39;ve approached an ATM armed with the correct numeric sequence to unlock thin sheets of plastic? Had I done psychology at university instead, perhaps I&#39;d know the answer.</p>
<p id="total-non-recall-footnote-1" style="font-style:italic"><a href="#total-non-recall-para-1" title="Return to paragraph">Footnote #1</a>: My legal department has requested I refer to this ATM as “machine with malicious intent”, rather than the trademarked HAL. Legal department B proceeded to remind me I’m a valuable customer for whom the bank would harbour no malicious intent. Finally, my third legal department demands I stop pretending I have legal departments, thereby denying its own existance.</p>
