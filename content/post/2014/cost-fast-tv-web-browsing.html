<p>Forgive the link to a paywall, but the opening summary of <a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/in-depth/revealed-the-22bn-cost-of-fast-tv-web-browsing-on-nbn/story-e6frgaif-1227037958835#">this article in The Australian newspaper</a> is amazing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE former Labor government’s decision to pursue a fibre-to-the-home, super-fast, broadband network would have a net cost to taxpayers of $22.2 billion, but the Coalition’s model still leaves them paying billions to deliver access to the bush and urban fringes, a landmark cost-benefit analysis reveals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, damn those people who don&#39;t live in cities. Don&#39;t they know how selfish their rural lifestyle is?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Coalition-commissioned analysis</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A government-commissioned analysis on the people they replaced. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>[..] finds the expense of providing high-speed internet access to people who live in uncommercial rural and regional areas, as well as urban fringes, would cost nearly $5bn but the benefits are only a fraction of that. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s why we only have electricity to the node. The only thing consumers use (and will ever use) power for is heating, stoves and light; and those are already serviced by our extensive natural gas network.</p>
