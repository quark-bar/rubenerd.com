<p>A subtle irony of working for a cloud infrastructure company: many of our clients have so much data, its faster for them to drop off physical drives and have us upload it right to their cloud instance. The company is more than happy to do it though. For Australian customers with capped internet in particular, it would be expensive and time consuming process.</p>
<p>This is akin to what Amazon offers with their Glacier offering, though we do it for everyone. We’re faster and have better support :).</p>
<p>We also wiped and zero–out drives multiple times before shipping back, though customer’s need to know we’re doing this.</p>
