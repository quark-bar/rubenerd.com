<p>Part of the reason I got back into anime and manga around 2006 was simply because it was so different to anything I&#39;d seen or read before. Case in point, yesterday <a rel="friend met co-worker kin muse crush date sweetheart" href="http://kirinyan.net/">Clara</a> and I watched the first two episodes of <em>Cuticle Tantei Inaba</em> in a public library, possibly the worst setting given we wanted to roar with laughter at least a thousand times an episode, give or take.</p>
<p>With its impossible plot twists and settings, otaku in–jokes and gags, it was absolutely, thoroughly <strong>inexplicable</strong>.</p>

<p>Our protagonist Hiroshi is a retired police dog human hybrid, who has ears like a cat, the mane of a fox and an uncontrollable attraction to certain human hairstyles. His crack team includes Yuuta, an exceedingly attractive young man who cross–dresses more convincingly than I care to admit; and Kei, who at least in this crazy universe appears somewhat normal.</p>
<p>Together, they attempt to solve crimes perpetrated by mafia Don Valentino and his associates in organised crime. Of course, Don Valentino just happens to be a goat with a literal appetite for counterfeit money. Bleet.</p>

<p>Now, I know what you&#39;re thinking. Ruben, you&#39;re extremely attractive. Well, I assure you flattery will get you absolutely nowhere, unless it&#39;s in the comment field after you&#39;ve <a href="http://rubenerd.com/coffee/">donated a cup of coffee</a>. The other thing you&#39;re thinking, could a premise so utterly implausible and fantastic really be watchable, let alone good?</p>
<p>Somehow, this ridiculous plot and characters somehow gel together into a series that <strong>works</strong>. Combine this deliciously creamy plot with stellar voice acting and a delightfully cliché Italian-American mafia soundtrack, and we have a series I get the feeling Clara and I will both want to marathon the rest of while eating a big bowl of Japanese pasta. Good heavens how I miss that Italian–Japanese fusion restaurant in Wheelock Place.</p>

<p>As an aside, the manga started on my birthday in 2008. Not sure what relevance this has to a series review, just thought I&#39;d pass it on. I&#39;ve also been told by Clara I bear a passing resemblance to one of the police officers, though I think she&#39;s just being polite.</p>
