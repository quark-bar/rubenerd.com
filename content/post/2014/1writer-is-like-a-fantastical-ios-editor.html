<p>When I laid eyes on the original Byword, I knew it was the editor for me. It wasn’t pretentious or loaded with features. It had iCloud and Dropbox sync, local storage, and a clean interface. Occasionally its two settings screens or tiny sync conflict previews would trip me up, but overall it was a solid piece of kit.</p>
<p>Despite this, and the fact it sounds more like an abbreviated Microsoft product, <a href="http://1writerapp.com/‎" title="1Writer website">1Writer</a> has supplanted Byword as my primary editor on iOS in 2014.</p>
<p>It could very well be a case of <a title="Problem exists between keyboard and chair" href="http://www.hackersdictionary.com/html/entry/PEBKAC.html">PEBKAC</a>, but Byword 2.0 introduced a few strange anomalies. 3G syncing stopped working, regardless of whether it was enabled to use mobile/celluar data in Settings or not. Renaming notes was a hit and miss operation. As with Drafts, the loading time got rather silly. After a while, these quirks started to wear me down, so I decided to finally look for alternatives.</p>
<p><em>Turns out</em>, <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/">Shawn Blanc</a> recently <a title="The Sweet Setup: Staff Favorites" href="http://thesweetsetup.com/articles/staff-favorites/">moved off Byword himself</a>, citing reliability concerns. On his company’s site, he listed 1Writer as his chosen alternative. I trust Shaun’s sensibilities, so I decided to give it a whirl.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, I’ve had it for about a week now, and adore it. Its design reminds me of Fantastical, which makes me happy. Its file hierarchy is logically laid out, its Markdown preview is a visual improvement, and it feels subjectively faster. About all that I’m missing is Byword’s night theme for those evening train trips.</p>
<p>It’s US$2.99 on the App Store, and no I was not paid for this. Though if the developer liked the free publicity and wanted to shout me a coffee, I wouldn’t object ;).</p>
