<p>Robin was one of those previous few who made us laugh and think, as children and adults.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t think how to put this unselfishly, but his breathless standup got me through so many of my own dark times. I don&#39;t care for celebrities or gossip, but Robin was one of the few I&#39;d have loved to meet. What a wonderful human being.</p>
