<p>In my <a title="Rubénerd: 1Writer is like a Fantastical iOS editor" href="http://rubenerd.com/1writer-is-like-a-fantastical-ios-editor/">review of 1Writer</a> earlier this week, I said:<br />
<blockquote cite="http://rubenerd.com/1writer-is-like-a-fantastical-ios-editor/"><p>Suffice to say, I’ve had it for about a week now, and adore it. [..] About all that I’m missing is Byword’s night theme for those evening train trips.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well speak of the devil, <a title="Tweet from 1writerapp announcing 1.3.1 release" href="https://twitter.com/1writerapp/status/451232023193985024">1.3.1 was released</a> earlier today with <strong>that exact feature</strong>. I’m not entirely sure if the Default Extension setting was available previously; if not this a welcome addition as well.</p>
<p>Without a doubt now, <a href="http://1writerapp.com/">1Writer</a> is my new favourite iOS editor. It’s fast, reliable, simple to use and has just the right mix of features I’ve been looking for on the platform for a long time. I look forward to our future textual collaborations.</p>
