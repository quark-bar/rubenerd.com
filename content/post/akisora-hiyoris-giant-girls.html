<p>I think I blue a fuse upon seeing this <a href="http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=46326820">art on Pixiv</a>. It reminded me of the original <em><a href="https://rubenerd.com/tag/bakemonogatari/">Bakemonogatari</a></em> opening, where everyone’s favourite tsundere walked larger-than-life through the streets. Only this time, with fighter jets and equally-large flying saucers.</p>  

<p>Safebooru <a href="http://safebooru.donmai.us/posts/1815222?tags=aki_%28akisora_hiyori%29">taggers</a> claim they’re F-22 jets, though the make of the UFOs remain a mystery. I know far more about civilian than military aviation, so I defer to their expertise.</p>

<p>As for the motivation behind this inexplicable art series, Google Translate claims the artist merely wanted to draw giant girls, and the ensuing ridiculousness. Mission accomplished.</p>
