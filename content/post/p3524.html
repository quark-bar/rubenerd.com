<cite>My Pownce profile with the closure notice</cite></p>
<p>I admit to shamelessly copying the title for this post from <a href="http://gigaom.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-i-hardly-used-ya/">Om Malik&#39;s latest blog post</a> on <a href="http://gigaom.com/">GigaOm</a>; it was just too clever to pass up!</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.pownce.com/2008/12/01/goodbye-pownce-hello-six-apart/">It&#39;s official</a>, <a href="http://pownce.com/">Pownce</a> has been bought by <a href="http://sixapart.com/">Six Apart</a> and will promptly be shut down by the middle of this month. Pownce was another clone of the Twitter microblogging social network that had a few more extra collaborative features, but it just wasn&#39;t better or different enough to justify most people moving over.</p>
<p>I used Pownce (<a href="http://pownce.com/rubenerd/">http://pownce.com/rubenerd/</a>) for a period of time earlier this year, but only because my desktop Twitter client at the time also allowed you to simultaneously post to it. I thought the interface was a bit cleaner and more interesting, but at that point I already had several hundred followers on Twitter as well as all my friends. When I moved over to <a href="http://tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a> for my desktop Twittering (<a href="http://rubenerd.com/p1347/">I&#39;ve changed Twitter clients, again</a> I ceased updating my Pownce profile.</p>
<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I was never quite comfortable with the idea of having all my shared media part of a closed or gated site like this; it&#39;s the same reason I don&#39;t put anything of value or substance on my Facebook profile either. A Twitter approach which keeps the underlying messaging infrastructure simple with links you post yourself to media you want to share makes much more sense, and is infinitely more flexible. <a href="http://brightkite.com/">Brightkite</a> (<a href="http://rubenerd.com/p2162/">which I reviewed back in October</a>) is a perfect example of this kind of &quot;ecosystem&quot; approach where multiple sites and services are used together to create something wonderful.</p>
<p>I wonder how <a href="http://jaiku.com/">Jaiku</a> is going under Google these days? I had a Jaiku profile (<a href="http://rubenerd.jaiku.com/">http://rubenerd.jaiku.com</a>) which also used to be updated with the same Twitter desktop client software I used in the past too, but since moving to TweetDeck which only posts to Twitter I let that wither as well. It makes you wonder whether <a href="http://identi.ca">Identi.ca</a> stands any chance at all.</p>
