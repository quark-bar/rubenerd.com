<p>What do you do a whole fridge of fruit when you only have a day to eat it all? You make Rainer Schade&#39;s Ultimate Juice (patent pending). As with all enlightened individuals, my father has agreed to release the source code:</p>
<ul>
<li>one Banana</li>
<li>two fuji apples</li>
<li>one large kiwifruit</li>
<li>quarter papaya</li>
<li>one carrot</li>
</ul>
<p>I suggested adding Red Bull to it, but he refused. Maybe I might have to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29">fork from the main project</a>.</p>
