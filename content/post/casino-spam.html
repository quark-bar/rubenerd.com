<p>You&#39;re assuming a lot here people. First, that I gamble (stuff that), second that I trust my Spam (stuff that), and third that I&#39;m a moron… that&#39;s your cue as a reader to say &quot;stuff that&quot;.</p>
<p>In any event, I don&#39;t gamble and I can&#39;t imagine I&#39;d ever start just because I got an unauthorised junk message. And I wonder how much in &quot;fees&quot; or the like you have to part with to get your &quot;Free&quot; $300.00?</p>
