<p>I love reading the <a href="http://jordy.gundy.org/">Jordy Blog</a> by Jordan Gunderson, all his posts are informative and interesting and the design of his site is very slick… not like mine ;).</p>
<p>In particular I liked his response to the recent court ruling in the United States against companies that edit and distribute &quot;clean&quot; versions of modern Hollywood movies.</p>
<blockquote><p>The skinny of it is that U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch ruled that the distribution of edited movies (which have been scrubbed of objectionable content) violates copyrights.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>My response: “Thank you from protecting me from those malicious sanitizers! My children will finally be protected from accidentally viewing a nudity-free ‘Titanic’! Thanks to your bitter reluctance to give your paying-customers what they want, society can finally rid itself of the harmful effects that occur when children aren’t exposed to graphic violence and soft porn on a regular basis. Again, thank you Hollywood for looking out for me and mine!”</p>
