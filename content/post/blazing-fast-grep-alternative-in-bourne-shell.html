<p>I’ve always relied on Perl for sysadmin tasks, but I’ve been trying to get better at Bourne shell scripting. One operation I did constantly in Perl was searching for substrings:</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/env perl

use strict;
use warnings;

my $string = "Zettai ryouiki"
my $sub  = "ryouiki"

print "Tousaka!" if ($line =~ m/substring);
</pre>

<p>Until now I’d just been using grep, like a gentleman. If you’re network–bound and have a limited number of comparisons, it’s fine. Otherwise, it’s slow enough that even an i5 MacBook Air takes a moment between each operation.</p>

<pre>
#!/bin/sh
_string="Zettai ryouiki"
_sub="ryouiki"

[ `echo ${_string} | grep '${_sub}'` ] &amp;&amp; echo "Tousaka!"
</pre>

<p>We can do better. An alternative is this neat trick, proposed by <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8811800">Matt Day</a> on Stack Overflow:</p>

<pre>
if test "${_string#*$_sub}" != "${_string}"; then
    echo "Tousaka!"
fi
</pre>

<p>No pipes, no grep, just speed. <em>Sugoi!</em></p>
