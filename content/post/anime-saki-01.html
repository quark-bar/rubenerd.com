<p>One thing I never do is log on to my university&#39;s network and access people&#39;s public shared folders. It just doesn&#39;t happen. When I don&#39;t access people&#39;s public shared folders I also don&#39;t get new shows to watch. One such series I didn&#39;t get was <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/saki/">Saki</a>, a show I&#39;d read about that&#39;s all about a mahjong club and the shenanigans of its members.</p>
<p><!--oldmore--></p>
<p>What can I say, I was instantly drawn (if you&#39;ll pardon the anime medium pun) to the premise, I played mahjong when I was growing up (albeit the simplified Singapore Expat version) and absolutely <strong>loved it</strong>. There&#39;s obviously an element of chance, but I found it really fun and interesting because you&#39;re thinking and planning ahead as well as during your immediate turn, and like poker you also spend much of your time trying to read your opponents. I learned to read Chinese numerical characters from playing it, even if I can&#39;t draw them!</p>
<p style="width:500px; text-align:center; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic"><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/anime.saki.01.5.jpg" alt="" style="height:281px; width:500px; display:inline; border:0px;" /><br />Gonzo included this zettai ryouiki imagery to advance the plot.</p>
<p>What I hadn&#39;t anticipated though was the anime adaptation of the Saki manga would be picked up by… Gonzo. For those who don&#39;t know, Gonzo are somewhat infamous for their style of art and the types of shows they produce (and have recently been in financial difficulties). They were the animation company behind <strong>Rosario+Vampire&#39;s</strong> bats and also <strong>Strike Witches</strong>, another show that I thought had a really brilliant premise and story set in an alternative World War II era but I just couldn&#39;t bring myself to watch more than a few episodes!</p>
<p>I gulped thinking Saki might suffer the same problem as having a brilliant premise but be let down by such stuff, and while having watched the first episode I did notice the level of blatant fanservice was much higher than shows I would usually dignify my time with, it was nowhere near as extreme as SW. Then again I don&#39;t think anything other than unabashed ecchi titles could be as blatant as SW!</p>
<p style="width:500px; text-align:center; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic"><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/anime.saki.01.4.jpg" alt="" style="height:281px; width:500px; display:inline; border:0px;" /><br />Wow Saki, you’re so… useful!</p>
<p>The story centres around <strong>Miyanaga Saki</strong> who has a knack for mahjong and in particular the uncanny ability to intentionally lose with a perfect +-0 score, a result of &quot;diplomatically&quot; playing it for so many years with her family. She&#39;s forced to attend a mahjong club meeting by her friend <strong>Suga Kyoutarou</strong> who used her to get a girls meal in the canteen because it looked tastier, ha! Wait, they have separate meals?</p>
<p>Then there&#39;s <strong>Haramura Nodoka</strong> who Saki sees walking past at the beginning. Saki thinks she&#39;s beautiful, and it turns out she&#39;s in the club too. I&#39;m assuming she plays mahjong to distract her from the severely painful back problems she must have with breasts that are so large they must impede her breathing! Well, I guess it is Gonzo.</p>
<p style="width:500px; text-align:center; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic"><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/anime.saki.01.2.jpg" alt="" style="height:281px; width:500px; display:inline; border:0px;" /><br />Sugooooooooi!</p>
<p>Finally there&#39;s <strong>Takei Hisa</strong>, the super sophisticated clubs leader and a member of probably an overly powerful student council (as it tends to go), Saki&#39;s friend <strong>Someya Mako</strong> who wears glasses so therefore must be smart and <strong>Kataoka Yuki</strong> the cheerful comedy relief.</p>
<p>And they play mahjong. East wind! Build the walls!</p>
<p style="width:500px; text-align:center; font-weight:bold; font-style:italic"><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/anime.saki.01.3.jpg" alt="" style="height:281px; width:500px; display:inline; border:0px;" /><br />Don’t worry about me… I spiked the tea.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;ll watch all of it, and if I do I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;ll post much about it given I have so much work and studying to do and waste enough time talking about <a href="http://rubenerd.com/anime/">anime</a> and <a href="http://rubenerd.com/nonsense/">nonsense</a> as it is, but I&#39;m keeping an open mind and am hoping to be surprised. It&#39;s about mahjong and I used to be great at it, come on!</p>
