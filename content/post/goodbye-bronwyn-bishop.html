<p>Australian Speaker of the House Bronwyn Bishop has resigned, after several weeks of damning evidence showing her abuse of government entitlements. Likely most famous was her taxpayer–funded, meme–generating helicopter trip to a party fundraiser.</p>

<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/2015/bron1.jpg" alt="" style="width:320px; height:180px;"  /></p>

<p>For a government claiming the “age of entitlement” (whatever that means) is “over”, this was particularly egregious. Ditto how hard they came down on former speaker Peter Slipper, who’s expenses look like a coffee run compared to Ms Bishop. And even as Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced her resignation, he chose to blame the system rather than Ms Bishop specifically. Of course.</p>

<p>History will tell if she’s judged most harshly for her biased performance as Speaker (ejecting hundreds of opposition members, compared to single digits for the Government), or her entitlement abuse.</p>

<p>May some dignity and respect return to the post. We all deserve better of our elected officials.</p>
