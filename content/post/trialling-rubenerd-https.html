<p>As the title suggests, I’m <a href="https://rubenerd.com/">trialling SSL on Rubenerd.com</a>. Click the link to hopefully see the exact same site you're seeing now.</p>

<p>Despite being security-concious enough to eschew (gesundheit) externally-hosted JavaScript and fonts, I never implemented SSL/TLS. There were several reasons:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>It was impossible on my shared hosting account in 2004.</p></li>

<li><p>Certificates were expensive.</p></li>

<li><p>My tiny VPS couldn't handle the CPU and memory requirements.</p></li>

<li><p>Old podcast clients choke on HTTPS URLs.</p></li>

<li><p>The barrier to implementation was <em>just</em> high enough to not justify my time.</p></li>

<li><p>I didn't have anything sensitive enough here to justify it. Well, maybe some of the anime posts, but you wouldn’t believe how many screenshots and figures I've had to avoid posting here to keep this SFW. It’d be so much easier if people channeled their prudish sensitivities towards gruesome violence instead of the human body; but that’s for another post. What were we talking about again?</p></li>

</ol>

<p>All of these points are now moot or invalid, so https it is. I don't have an extended validation certificate (the one that puts a green bar in most browsers), but your connection to rubenerd.com is now secure.</p> 

<p>Whereas previously we’d ask <em>“why bother”</em> for sites like this, in 2015 the question should be <em>“why not”</em>?</p>

<p>If you still think SSL/TLS here is pointless, don’t like the cert authority I went with, or think I’m a sucker for not waiting for the free <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>, I don’t care.</p>
