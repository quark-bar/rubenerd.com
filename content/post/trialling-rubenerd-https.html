<p>As the title suggests, I’m trialling SSL on Rubénerd. Well, TLS specifically, in light of recent issues.</p>

<p>Despite being security-paranoid enough to eschew (gesundheit) externally-hosted scripts and fonts, I never implemented HTTPS. There were several reasons:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>It was impossible on my shared hosting account in 2004.</p></li>

<li><p>Certificates were expensive.</p></li>

<li><p>My tiny VPS couldn't handle the CPU and memory requirements.</p></li>

<li><p>Old podcast clients choked on HTTPS URLs.</p></li>

<li><p>The barrier to implementation was <em>just</em> high enough to not justify my time.</p></li>

<li><p>I didn't have anything sensitive enough here to justify it. Well, maybe some of the anime posts, but you wouldn’t believe how many screenshots and figures I've had to avoid posting here to keep this SFW. It’d be so much easier if people channeled their prudish sensitivities towards gruesome violence instead of the human body; but that’s for another post. What were we talking about again?</p></li>

</ol>

<p>All of these points are now moot or invalid, so HTTPS it is. It’s only a domain-verified cert, but your connection here is now (more) secure. The last step is to get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling">OCSP stapling</a> working, which for some reason nginx isn’t making easy for me.</p> 

<p>Whereas previously we’d ask <em>“why bother”</em> for sites like this, in 2015 the question should be <em>“why not”</em>?</p>

<p>If you still think HTTPS here is pointless, don’t like the cert authority I went with, or think I’m a sucker for not waiting for the free <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>, I don’t care. If the change has legitimately broken my site in your browser, do let me know though.</p>
