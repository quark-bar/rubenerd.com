<p>Mac developer and lovely person Daniel Jalkut recently shared his <a href="https://www.thisismyjam.com/danielpunkass">This Is My Jam</a> profile. The site is what you think it is.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while attempting to add <em>Tiger in the Rain</em> by Michael Franks (my <a href="http://tigerintherain.com/">favourite song</a> of all time), I kept getting the same error.</p>

<blockquote><p>Sorry, that video can't be played on Jam due to restrictions from its owner. Maybe try one of these instead?</p></blockquote>

<p>The next step will be to try tracks from his latest independent album. Darn music labels.</p>
