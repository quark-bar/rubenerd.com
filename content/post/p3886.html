According to their <a href="http://noscript.net/faq#qa1_1">FAQ</a>, the NoScript logo has a name and some history!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>What is that strange, evil blue being in the NoScript logo?</strong></p>
<p>It is Jesse the JavaScript Worm, an extra-dimensional menace trapped by NoScript. He’s said to be the evil cousin of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trogdor">Trogdor</a>, but I swear by the <a href="http://www.venganza.org/">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a> I did not know anything about StrongBad and his dragon when I designed NoScript logo <img src='http://rubenerd.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>I love these guys, they clearly know what they’re doing, they’re <a href="http://www.venganza.org/">Pastafarians</a> like me and they have a sense of humour to boot!</p>
