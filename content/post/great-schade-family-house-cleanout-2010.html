<p>For those of you wondering why my usually verbose stream of consciousness has <strong>only</strong> resulted in a few blog posts over the last few days, I&#39;ve been scanning, shredding and backing up thousands of documents for my dad again. We&#39;re also taking the time to do a full scale apartment and rented storage cleanout.</p>
<p>If we don&#39;t need something, its being:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>scanned</strong>, in the case of documents, receipts and science journals</li>
<li><strong>ripped</strong>, in the case of computer data CDs</li>
<li><strong>donated</strong></li>
<li><strong>sold</strong></li>
<li><strong>recycled</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Our aim is to <strong>reduce the amount of stuff we have by half</strong>, perhaps even more. For far too long we&#39;ve been slaves to junk and material possessions we don&#39;t need, and we&#39;ve decided to do something about it.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no real Buddhist nirvana motivation behind it, it just makes sense. Less stuff means we don&#39;t need to pay for storage, and we can move into a smaller apartment to save rent.</p>
<h3>Other factors [insert prime number pun here]</h3>
<p>Since my dad started working from home we&#39;ve had to accommodate business and home stuff under one roof and its started to feel like we&#39;re living in a dense jungle of bleached white paper and boxes. Couple that with our family&#39;s tendency to hoard everything like frantic hermit crabs and there&#39;s a recipe for a really smashing chowder. Sorry, I got distracted by thinking about seafood.</p>
<p>Now that it&#39;s been a few years, we&#39;re also starting to make some tough decisions about my late mum&#39;s possessions as well so we can start to move on. It&#39;s really, really hard, far harder than I ever imagined, but we&#39;re making progress.</p>
