<p>I simply couldn&#39;t believe it when I realised, but it&#39;s been exactly one year and three days since our last <a href="http://rubenerd.com/tag/fun-facts/">Rub&eacute;nerd Fun Fact</a>! Not only that, but we&#39;re up to <strong>Fun Fact #100</strong>, an auspicious milestone if ever there was one.</p>
<p>So here it is, the fun fact you&#39;ve waited over a year for! Brace yourself!</p>
