<p>For those of you who use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnutella">Gnutella file sharing networks</a>, you may be interested in this slick clone of <a href="http://limewire.com/">LimeWire</a> which I myself only just discovered called <strong><a href="http://frostwire.com/">FrostWire</a></strong>. Their website is painfully Web 2.0, but the app itself looks compelling.</p>
<p>The problem with LimeWire is it intentionally connects to fewer peers and results lower download speeds unless you purchase the professional version. FrostWire doesn&#39;t have this limitation, and it&#39;s completely free (as in beer and speech) and contains no spyware or other nasties.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell so far it uses the older LimeWire interface which I preferred anyway, and it&#39;s available for Windows, Mac OS X and a slew of Linux distributions. I don&#39;t use Gnutella anymore myself, but passing it on for what it may be worth. I&#39;m not Bill Kurtis.</p>
