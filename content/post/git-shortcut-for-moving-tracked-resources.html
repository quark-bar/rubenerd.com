<p>Yes, I didn't know this until today, much like there's someone born every minute who hasn't seen <em>The Flintstones</em>. Previously to move a file, I would have done this:</p>

<pre>
$ mv ./original ./new
$ git rm ./original
$ git add ./new
$ git commit -m 'moved original to new'
</pre>

<p>Not to get all Malcolm Gladwell on you, but <em>turns out</em>, there's a <code>mv</code> command instead:</p>

<pre>
$ git mv ./original ./new
$ git commit -m 'moved original to new'
</pre>
