<p>I have my full time studies resuming for this semester this week and they look like they&#39;re going to be taking a ton of my time. I wanted to comment though on something I read in the paper this morning, seems some people in Australia still support the idea of keeping states.</p>
<p>I guess given I&#39;ve lived overseas and in four different states in Australia (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia) I&#39;ve never seen the point of states. To me they&#39;re relics of the colonial days that we&#39;ve unfortunately lugged with us to the present along with the British Monarchy that don&#39;t serve us any purpose now and in some ways actually hinder our progress. I&#39;ve seen little evidence that having an extra layer of government and bureaucracy improves our lives or representation; all I see is duplicated effort, wasted money and lots of infighting.</p>
<p>I think when we live here we tend to forget that Australia may be a vast country, but we have a tiny population. When people in South Australia complain that the huge populations in the Eastern states get more attention, <em>huge</em> really is a relative term! Australia has less people than California &#8212; a single US state &#8212; or even Tokyo! South Australia in particular has less people than some suburbs of Singapore!</p>
<p>If we do decide to keep states for historical or cultural reasons, at the very least we should federalise most of their responsibilities. There&#39;s no reason each state needs to have it&#39;s own education, health, road transport or rail system authorities just to name a few.</p>
<p>As I said I could spend days talking about this, but I do have other things I&#39;m supposed to be doing; thank goodness for <a href="http://rubenerd.com/my-unicomp-keyboard/">buckling spring keyboards</a>!</p>
<p>I&#39;d love to hear what you think about this, in particular why you think I might be wrong. I must be missing something.</p>
