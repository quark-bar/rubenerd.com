<p>So I was talking to somebody online about Taekwondo and wasn&#39;t sure about the spelling, so I looked up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea#Sports">Sports section</a> on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea">South Korea</a> Wikipedia article. In hindsight I may as well have just looked up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taekwondo">Taekwondo</a> page itself. You do silly things when you&#39;re half asleep.</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, as it turns out StarCraft is South Korea&#39;s national sport. If it&#39;s on Wikipedia, it <strong>has</strong> to be true! A <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_national_sport_of_South_Korea">WikiAnswers page</a> corroborates this.</p>
<p>I learn something new every day; and forget two other things. Komapsumnida.</p>
