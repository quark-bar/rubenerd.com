<p>Three months ago, I switched to using DuckDuckGo as my primary search engine. I've been surprised (though perhaps I shouldn't have been) at how well it's worked, and now I couldn't imagine going back to Google.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic">(Rub√©nerd's site search, has also been served by DDG for a couple of years).</p>

<p>First, some context. The web is littered with examples of services that based their existance on not being something else. Ello and ADN weren't Twitter. Diaspora wasn't Facebook. None of them had/have stuck, largely because push factors aren't sufficient to sway changes in behaviour.</p>

<p>DuckDuckGo is indispensible because of personal pull factors. Aside from not being Google (a plus in my book), it has has features Google doesn't have, and I can't live without them now.</p>

<p>Take bang operators. <a href="http://www.caseyliss.com/2015/3/19/duckduckgo">Casey Liss did a great writeup</a> of these, but in a nutshell they allow you to prepend tags to search queries to take you elsewhere. Typing the following will take you to Animedb's and Wikipedia's Bakemonogatari pages:</p>

<pre>
bakemonogatari !anime
bakemonogatari !w
</pre>

<p>For when DDG's results aren't enough (increasingly rare), you can even do a secured Google search which won't leak referrer information:</p>

<pre>
bakemonogatari !g
</pre>

<p>Answers are also a delightfully helpful addition. For example, if you <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=regex">search for regex</a>, you'll get a summary of all the operators.</p>

<p>If you haven't tried, set DDG as your primary search engine for a few days. You may be surprised.</p>
