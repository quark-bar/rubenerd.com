Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has proposed lowering federal taxes, and allowing the states to collect their own income tax for the first time since the 1940s. [ABC News has the details].

Normally this wouldn't be a topic for *Rub√©nerd*! But there are two quick reasons why I think this is a bad idea.

1. For a country with the population of Australia, states are useless. If we want to reduce the "blame game" between states, abolish them. I propose everyone repatriating back into New South Wales; though I'd be more than happy to rename this to Australia, and having Victoria's Daniel Andrews take the reins.

2. Multiple layers of tax will make life more complicated for accountants, sellers, buyers and the hapless IT workers who have to maintain databases. Among the hardest work I've done in my career is dealing with American state tax laws, we don't need that here.

Ditch this idea (and the GST, while we're at it) and use a simple progressive tax that doesn't unfairly discriminate against those least able to pay it. Done and done!
