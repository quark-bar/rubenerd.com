In what's likely the most mundane news you've read all week, posts on *[Rubenerd]* are now in boxes again. Boom!

I tried the whole miniamlism thing, but I like the clean breaks between sections. I think it renders the site more readable, and easier to visually separate the wheat from the chaff (admittedly a risk when most of your site content is the aforementioned chaff, including this post). The drop shadows and borders also harken back to DOS in a delightfully tacky way.

For what it's worth, the [original Rubenerd in 2003] had a similar arrangement. Now all I need are tabs along the top, and we'll be rocking more nostalgia than I know what to do with.
