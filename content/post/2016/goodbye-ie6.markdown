I just realised something.

* *Rub√©nerd* started using Let's Encrypt SSL certs, mostly because this site is one long, over-engineered experiment.

* All HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS

* My cipher suite doesn't include support for Internet Explorer 6

Therefore, Internet Explorer 6 users can't get here. Which means no more IE6 CSS hacks!

I kept the IE6 hacks around because I knew them off by heart, and my design is simple enough that it wasn't much effort to include anyway. This finally gives me the impetus to remove these entirely.
