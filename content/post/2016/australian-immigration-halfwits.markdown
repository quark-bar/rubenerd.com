I've tried really hard to keep an air of positivity here without politics, but I really feel compelled to comment here because of how egregious this is.

Australia is a beautiful country with some of the friendliest people in the world. We have universal healthcare, stricter worker and consumer protections than most countries, and is relatively safe. We also harbour some deep secrets: our appalling treatment of our first peoples, and our disgusting treatment of refugees.

### A history of not giving a shit

Under successive governments on both sides, Australia has implemented a [cynical policy of offshore detention](https://www.humanrights.gov.au/publications/last-resort-national-inquiry-children-immigration-detention/6-australias-immigration). Fearing we may be swamped with people we're legally and ethically obligated to assist, it became policy to turn back any boats, refuse any resettlement in Australia, and process people in Guantanamo Bay hellholes in Manus Island and Nauru. In fact, our Immigration Department is [paying Nauru's bills](http://michaeljfield.tumblr.com/post/122213340378/nauru-australias-stressed-client-state).

In Orwellian style, justifications have ranged from wanting to "put people smugglers out of business" to national security. The truth is our refugee intake is globally a rounding error, that for each suspicious actor there are hundreds who need genuine help, and that we've [even paid off people smugglers](http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/asylum-boat-turnbacks-australia-paid-people-smugglers-under-former-labor-government-20150615-ghotbt.html). So much for breaking their business model. 

We've had the integrity and independence of our [Human Right Commissioner questioned](https://www.thesaturdaypaper.com.au/news/politics/2015/06/13/abbotts-war-gillian-triggs/14341176002000) on the basis that her calling out of these atrocities are "partisan". We've had our Murdoch press send reporters like Chris Kenny to claim everything is fine, while colluding with the Nauru government to ensure progressive reporters can't gain access with threats of imprisonment for locals who assist entry. Even the [United Nations has repeatedly called us out](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-11/un-committee-flags-concerns-about-australian-policy/5882190) on this.

<p style="font-style:italic">(If you want to read Chris Kenny’s nonsense, do a search on The Australian website; I can’t bring myself to link to it).</p>

### The re-elected get back to work

Last week, The Guardian Australia released [The Nauru Files](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-immigration-and-asylum), a damning collection of reports of the systematic abuse of innocent people in the hellhole our tax dollars fund. None of this should be news to any of us, and shame on Labor for [pretending to care](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/aug/13/the-nauru-files-labor-to-call-for-parliamentary-inquiry-into-abuse-allegations) to score political points when their official policy is [the same](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/01/asylum-seekers-greens-use-labors-key-weakness-to-attack-shortens-stronghold) as the government.

And now, [in a now-infamous interview](http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/australianz/australia-accuses-refugees-of-falsely-reporting-sexual-abuse) that is emblamatic of this entire issue, professional knuckle–dragger Mr Peter Dutton inserted this [suppository of wisdom](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/12/world/asia/australia-abbott-suppository-gaffe/index.html) into the debate:

> "I have been made aware of some incidents that have reported false allegations of sexual assault, because in the end, people have paid money to people smugglers and they want to come to our country," [Immigration Minister] Dutton said in an interview on Australian radio.
>
> "Some people have even gone to the extent of self-harming and people have self-immolated in an effort to get to Australia. Certainly some have made false allegations."

### Let me phrase this in a way even they understand

I don't care if half of them claimed false rape or set themselves on fire only to not die and make a point (what planet does the guy live on?). If one incident is true, ***one***, it's happening under your watch and you're wanting to sweep it under a rug, along with compassion, your legal responsibility, and the integrity of our government.

To Mr Dutton and the half-witted, drooling Government ministers not worthy to lick my shoes clean, may your dreams be as angisuehed and tortured as those who's lives you've ruined to score cheap political points. Sod off.
