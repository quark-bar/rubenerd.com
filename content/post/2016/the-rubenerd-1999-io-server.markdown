Iâ€™ve installed Dave Winer's 1999.io blogging software, at the uninspired location of:

    https://1999.rubenerd.com/

Right now I'm using it as an annexe, to replace Tumblr.

My primary blog will remain generated with Hugo, because its literally the only static blog engine that can chew though more than 5000 posts without breaking a sweat.

**UPDATE, 2018:** I've taken it down, and merged its posts back into the main site here.
