As a former university student performing some long term budgeting and forecasting, I learned something I should probably have known already. Things are about to get [much more expensive]:

> From 1 January 2017, the Australian Government will remove the upfront HECS-HELP discount of 10 per cent for eligible students that pay their student contributions upfront and the voluntary HELP repayment bonus of five per cent.
>
> People who have a HELP debt and make a voluntary repayment of $500 or more towards that debt currently receive a bonus of 5 per cent. The amount of the bonus is an additional credit against the studentâ€™s outstanding HELP debt.

Regrettable, but not surprising. This flippant justification was though:

> It is an amount never recovered by the Government.
