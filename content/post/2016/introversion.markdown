I've been an introvert for as long as I can remember. I have no problem hanging out with groups of people, provided I'm given a chance to mentally and physically recharge after. 

As most introverts will attest, it's hard. Even in the early 1990s, western primary schools changed their focus to support extroverted childern with group work. High school and unversity are all about parties. Then your work live is taken up with talking to people, either in teams or to customers.

Our electronic devices bombard us with notifications, text messages, phone calls and email. We're expected to be available every hour of the day by work, family, and friends. Despite the mental burden of each message, a lack of communication indicates an error state in extroverted societies; a veritable algorithmic exception to the program of life that must be caught and handled instead of embraced. 

Wow, that was a wanky sentence.

It's identical to sleep debt. Build up a healthy and regular amount of alone time/sleep, and you feel refreshed and happy. Skip alone time/sleep a few times, and you feel fatigued, tired, anxious, irritable and sad. And it accumulates, oh boy does it accumulate.

As Jonathan Rauch wrote:

> For introverts, to be alone with our thoughts us as restorative as sleeping, as nourising as eating".

That quote was from a **smashing** article by XXXX that suggests introverts even have different chemical reactions in their brains to extroverts. If true, it would explain a lot.

Regardless of the cause, it does mean one thing. When we cancel something, or don't go to an event, its not because we don't like you.
