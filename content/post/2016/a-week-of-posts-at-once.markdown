Last night, South Australia lost its entire energy grid.

In case you skimmed that, an Australian state [larger in geographic size] than Texas, lost its entire energy grid. Wild weather is being blamed for toppling key pieces of infrastructure, though the regular chorus of "[coal is good for humanity]" folks took it upon themselves to proclaim the issue was a reliance on renewable power. If only Mike and I were still doing [Fake No Agenda]...

Anyway, I figured if an entire Australian state can handle having their power knocked out, I can make up for a week's worth of posts.

Static site generation is great for operations, but it does mean publishing and uploading posts are two separate steps. A week of posts were "published" since [Humble Bundle], but unfortunately the uploading never happened. Not to get all Gladwell on you, but *turns out* an errant [pf rule] had blocked the host uploading the changes. 

So have a week's worth of posts, preceding this one.
