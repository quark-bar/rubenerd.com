For better or worse, work has started mandating use of Microsoft Office for Mac. Iâ€™ve been happily using Open/Neo/LibreOffice for almost my entire professional career and personal tasks, so I'm having to re-learn a ton of stuff.

(That said, for all its miscalulations, I do like Excel).

OneNote took my interest. As a heavy user of nvALT and MediaWiki, the premise looked very attractive. Starting it though, I was asked to log into an Office account, which if you dismiss closes the application. How was I supposed to create a local notebook then?

Unfortunately, this comment in OneNote's [suggestion box] suggests my experience isn't <abbr title="problem exists between keyboard and chair">PEBCAK</abbr>:

> In some cases you do not want or are not allowed to upload your notes to a cloud, therefore you should add offline notebooks to OneNote for Mac.

Microsoft's official response wasn't encouraging.

> Thanks for expressing your support for local notebooks on Mac. We have no plans to support local notebooks in our other clients, since storing your notebooks in the cloud enables experiences that are not otherwise possible.

This is tantamount to saying water is wet because if it isn't, it'd be dry.

It's their software though, and they're free to add and remove whatever features they want, just as I'm free to eschew (gesundheit) my use of it.
