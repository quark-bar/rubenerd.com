People are so quick to go online and write about negative experiences, so I'm attempting to balance with positivity. In this case Amex asked me to do a user survey based on an automated call I'd done earlier in the week.

I got the new PIN sorted out within a minute, so rated it "good". In the field for comments on why I didn't choose "excellent":

And in the field for why I would recommend Amex to a friend:
