This is my new favourite email unsubscribe footer:

> NOTE PS: if this isn't for you or isn't for you right now 
> then please feel free to reply 1,2, or 3

Note **and** PS. This is important! Okay, let's have the options.

> 1 I'm interested - but not right now (please contact in 
> 3-6 months)

I'm guessing less than zippo choose this option.

> 2 I'm not the right person in the company (sorry - I'd love
> an intro to the right person)

I'm sure you would.

> 3 This isn't right for us, please remove my details from your 
> database.

Surely you wouldn't use that as a way to validate my address to send me more spam, right?

I'm thinking there's an option missing:

> 4 I don't buy from unsolicited marketers, because their engagement in dodgy business practices (spam) prevents me having trust in them or taking them seriously

And while we're at it:

> 5 I think you're responsible for destroying a communications medium, causing lots of reasonable people to flock back to a half baked IRC clone that rhymes with snack
