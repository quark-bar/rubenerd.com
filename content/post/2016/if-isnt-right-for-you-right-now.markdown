The ease (or lack thereof) of unsubscribing from opt-out email newsletters has become something of a meme here. And for good reason; the state of email marketing is pretty grim. So we may as well have fun with some of the more egregious examples! 

Today's had the best email unsubscribe footer I've ever seen. No quick unsubscribe links, just a poorly-formatted list of rather terrible options.

I'm thinking there are a few options missing:
