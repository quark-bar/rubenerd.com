*Rubénerd* got some impromtu feedback from a work colleague today:

> Damn this blog is detailed

Glaringly absent was recognition of the writer's handsomeness. The writer of *Rubénerd*, not the writer of that review.

It's never a good sign when your comments about a review are longer than the review, other than maybe Robert Christgau, who I only learned about after his review of a Michael Franks album.
