I asked this on [Twitter last week]\:

> These random horticultural tweets brought to you by git-scm. Good thing cloning is permissible for plants.

That was clearly the wrong tweet. I did think that was rather clever though, in a dad joke kind of way. In other words, not clever at all, but heh. Let's [try this again]:

> Otto not listed on the [Hashicorp site] any more. The [official site] still there though

Turns out, I caught them in the process of retiring the new project. Mitchell [wrote this] on the Hashicorp blog:

> Today we are decommissioning Otto and ending active development and maintenance. This is motivated by several reasons, but primarily we felt the core abstractions and the out-of-box functionality of Otto did not meet our initial goal.

The promise of local and remote deployments with single commands seemed intriguing, if it could be realised. I appreciate their attitude of pulling it rather than letting it languish as abandonware, as so many free/open source projects become. I don't think it was big or established enough to have users contributing either.

Retiring Otto hopefully clears the air around Vagrant, and return the name to [this German devops blog]. Somewhere, there must be someone preparing the surface of their laptop lid to accept a new circular sticker without a sinister looking robot as well!

Anyway, just answering my own question in more than 140 characters here.
