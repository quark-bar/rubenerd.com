titke: "Most Hapanese"
---

This has to be the most Japanese story I've read in a long time. Posted in the Nikkei Asian Review:

> NAGOYA -- Uny Group Holdings will unload its 54% stake in kimono specialty retailer Sagami to an investment fund as part of streamlining efforts ahead of its planned merger with FamilyMart.

This would be equivilent to reading R.M. Williams is selling its stake in a Vegemite retailer in Austrlaia.

> Challenged by a decline in interest in kimonos among Japanese youth, Sagami had tried to diversify operations into household items and jewelry. But it sustained a 1 billion-yen net loss in the year ended February.

I have aspirations of owning a proper kimono one day, as well as a formal. Perhaps that's part of the problem, "youth" see them as a nice to have, but can't justify the cost. If its come at the cost of overspending on Western suits, that'd be a real shame.

> Prior to its marriage with convenience-store operator FamilyMart in September, Uny announced this month plans to close general-merchandise stores under its Apita and Piago chains, as well as Circle K locations.

I didn't know they owned Circle K. Today I learned a lot of things.

For what its worth, the Nikkei Asian Review posts some pretty good stuff. It's US $9.90 a month membership, an easy buy along with my Guardian Australia membership. If you want good quality journalism, pay for it.
