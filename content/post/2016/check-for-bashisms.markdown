For better or worse (depending on your disposition), GNU/Linux has become the *defacto* \*nix standard. But there are still plenty of unices out there, even Debian uses ash during start. If you're concerned with script portability, you should abstain from bashisms.

<p style="font-style:italic">I normally just call it Linux like a normal person, but this post concerns GNU bash, so I figured Iâ€™d make an exception. Purple monkey dishwashers).</p>

A quick way to check your scripts is with the excellent [checkbashims] script by Yann Dirson and Julian Gilbey. And it's even available on [homebrew], boom.

    $ checkbashisms -p retina.sh
    ==> possible bashism in retina.sh line 29 (<<< here string):
    ==> _original=`sed "s/this/that/" <<< $_image`
    ==> possible bashism in retina.sh line 61 (should be 'b = a'):
    ==> [ `uname` == "Darwin" ] && echo $_html | pbcopy

Heh, whoops. I've got some scripts to fix.
