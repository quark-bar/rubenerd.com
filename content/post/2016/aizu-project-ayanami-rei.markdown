I'm giving this minimalism thing a try. Whatever new objects I allow into my life have to justify their existence, because the ongoing cost of keeping things is just as much (if not more) than their initial price.

And then Aizu Project does a re-releases of an old temptation I'd been able to successfully avoid due to unavailability. Worse still, her price is shockinly resonable by today's standards.

Compared to her Kotobukiya rendition above, there’s no comparison. I used derivatives of the word comparison three times in this paragraph. Her face and features more closely She closer resembles her anime Her back doesn't look like its about to snap, and her face far closer resembles her.
