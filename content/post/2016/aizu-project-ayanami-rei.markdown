As I’ve discussed on [the show of late], I'm giving minimalism a try. New objects that enter my life have to justify their existance, and take as little space as possible doing so.

And then Aizu Project does a re-release of an old temptation I'd been able to successfully avoid due to unavailability. Worse still, her price is **shockingly** resonable by today's standards, at ¥5,860 on AmiAmi.

Of all her plastic renditions, this came closest to matching her 2D appearance. Everthing from her facial expression and construction, to her hair and somewhat reserved pose are all spot on. This is best girl from Evangelion, no question about it (sorry Asuka fans).

By comparison, take this one from Kotobukiya below. While she's compelling in her own way, she doesn't *look* like Rei. My back also aches on her behalf posing like that, and frankly I don't know how she breathes with a plugsuit that tight around her chest.

Either way, I suppose it’s a moot point given I can't, won't and/or shouldn't be buying her anyway.
