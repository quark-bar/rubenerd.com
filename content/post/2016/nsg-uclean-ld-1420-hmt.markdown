Back in the glorious old days of *Rubénerd*, I used to celebrate pointless milestones with [industrial cleaning equipment]. I'd do image searches for the number of posts I'd done at a certain point, and inveriably I'd end up with a fine piece of Tennant kit. It wasn't as dashing as a certian Doctor, but it cleaned up just as well.

Hey, that was pretty good.

Case in point, [The Tennant 3400 for post 3400]. What I lacked in originality, I made up for with a clean break. That was... less good.

[Needless to say] \(HAH!), I thought that chapter of the blog had passed. The last reference I made to a pointless milestone and industrial cleaning equipment was February 2012 for [post 4300]. But circumstances, call it chance, had other ideas.

Yesterday, I got a spam call from the US. A specific software vendor keeps trying to upsell me stuff I neither asked nor asked for. I emphasise the term with repitition because I certainly didn't ask for it, and I wouldn't have. I was devoid of asking. If asking were a parrot, it wouldn't just be sleeping.

To confirm whether the number on the caller ID was that same aforementioned software vendor, I searched for it. What was to appear but a piece of cleaning equipment, in Poland no less.

These are the technical specifications from the [product page]:
