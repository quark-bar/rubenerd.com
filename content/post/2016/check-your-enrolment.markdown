Australians, you have till 20:00 <abbr title="Australian Eastern Standard Time">AEST</abbr> to [confirm your enrolment]. You won't get another chance before the election in July.

I checked mine a few weeks ago thinking it'd be routine, and they were completely wrong. At least I didn't have to run to the Australian High Commission in Singapore and queue this time.
