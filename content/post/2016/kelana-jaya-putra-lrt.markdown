This photo by [cmglee] of the Kelana Jaya line in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia took me back. PJ is classed a satellite city of Kuala Lumpur, but it may as well be a suburb.

If I may put on my thirty-year-old man hat, *time was* this line was called the *Putra LRT*. Today, it's part of the *RapidKL* system, and one component which will be eventually integrated with the new MRT lines they're building. I had a job interview at the Dang Wangi station on that line back in 2006. I haven't been back to KL in almost a decade, I wonder how much its changed?

Now that I think of it, have a picture of the aforementioned [Dang Wangi] station by Two hundred percent on Wikimedia Commons too. It's cleaner than the stations in Australia, go figure.
