Instapaper has been bought by Pinterest.

I was reluctant to try Instapaper back in the day, for the same reason I never used Evernote and similar tools. We're entrusting a one–off, third–party service with a collection of material that could be yanked away at the operators whim, and the service-specific hooks would make it difficult to easily migrate off or replace it.

Compare this to something agnostic like Dropbox, and a tool that processes text locally. Heck, even something you can install on a server yourself, with a managed version you can pay for instead. 

Anyway, eventually I paid for it to try (mostly to support Marco Arment, who's Build and Analyse show with Dan Benjamin I enjoyed immensely), and it became indispensible. It was simple, had integrations with other applications I used, and mostly worked. Competitors like Pocket simply weren't as good.

Contrast that to Pinterest. I had an account with them briefly to see if it could support my old idea of the Rubénerd Annexe, before deciding it wasn't for me. Thesesdays, my primary experience is accidently hit their site from a search result, and having the content I was after pushed underneath a lightbox and compulsory registration form. Its as if a tiled Tumblr theme wrapped itself in the reviled user management system of Quora or Stackexchange.

I'm not entirely concerned with Instapaper being aquired (it has been once already), but that it's going into the hands of a business that does distasteful stuff like that.

Me thinks its time to book an evening at home to write a Instapaper scraper.
