I may (or may not) have been preoccupied with this for the last month, and even done a week of podcasts in the lead-up to it. But suddenly <strong>shit just got real</strong>.

I've removed "twenty-something" from about pages, and am prepared to mark the "30-39" dropdown item on registration forms and surveys. If anything else comes up, I figure I can just wing it. *Fake it till you make it!*

As always, this post is <a href="https://rubenerd.com/dedication/">dedicated to my mum</a> for whom I wouldn't be here without a huge amount of pain on her part three decades ago, and who can't be with us tomorrow to silly-brate.
