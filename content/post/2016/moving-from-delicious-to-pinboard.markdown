Changing habits, and services you once loved dearly, are hard. But I’ve been using a Pinboard for a few days now, and it's so much better I'm regretting not switching sooner.

You'd never guess the [terrible username].

I didn't want to switch. I [registered for del.icio.us] in 2003, and used it fairly consistently ever since. Almost every bookmark I’ve ever saved for a decade and a half is on there, making it a fascinating trip back in time now. It even generated a ton of [linkblog posts] here back in the day.

Unfortuantely, in what has become the new normal for beloved online serives, it has been passed around like a licroice jelly bean and regurgitated every time. It was sold to Yahoo!, then (famously) listed as sunsetted, then [sold to AVOS], then sold to Science, Inc, then sold to a new company owned by Science and Domainersuite.

The latest iteration of the site is pretty bad. Aesthetically, it’s a bit of a mess. It also has a shop, which for some reason sells things like microwaves. What a generic retailer has to do with a social bookmark site is beyond me, though I can only assume its a last-ditch attempt at monetisation.

The frustrating thing is it didn't have to be this way. I like Pinboard because it reminds me of the classic, no-nonsense delicious, and I'm happy to help pay Maciej's bills. With a simple design and clear business model, he's been profitable from day one. Delicious could have done that.
