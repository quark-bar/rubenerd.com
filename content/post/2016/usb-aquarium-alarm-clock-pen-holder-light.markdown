I really have no idea how I stumble upon things like this, but I'm [captivated by this eBay auction] in a way I haven't been in a very long time. The model number absolutely nails it.

> USB DESKTOP AQUARIUM MINI FISHTANK
> w/ RUNNING WATER + LIGHT + CLOCK
> [Model No: USB-FISHTANK] 

And look at the features, taken right from the page:

* USB Desktop Aquarium
* Mini Fishtank
* Running Water Circulator Pump
* River Rocks + Artifical Plant
* USB Power Connector
* LCD Calendar Clock
* Alarm Clock w/ Snooze
* Multifunction Penholder
* Multicolour Interior Light
* Nature Sounds

This tickles me in the same way the [Mug Boss did in 2006]. I would never buy one of these, or accept one as a gift, but I can admire it as the clearly spectacular piece of abstract modern art that it is.
