The Escapist himself sent a really nice message about the latest Rubénerd Show and Overnightscape adventures in New York and New Jersey :)

Pausing him there for a second, that's really cool! I loved that we got off the beaten track and saw stuff that only true locals of NJ would have known about, and been able to relay appreciation for.

And the geotracking thing is wild, makes me want to try another audio journey again!

I'm glad the fun and adventure we got from these episodes came through, thanks. Looking back on it now, I still can't believe it happened. It's cliché, but it felt like a dream.

And I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say its your *duty* to start Escapist Radio again.
