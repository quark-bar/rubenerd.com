Running [Perl][perl] in [FreeBSD][freebsd]? You should be [using env][env], but a heads up by the tireless maintainers:

    Message from perl5-5.20.3_8:
    The /usr/bin/perl symlink has been removed starting with Perl 5.20.
    For shebangs, you should either use:

    #!/usr/local/bin/perl

    or

    #!/usr/bin/env perl

    The first one will only work if you have a /usr/local/bin/perl,
    the second will work as long as perl is in PATH.

As an aside, the dependency list on the Perl5 FreshPorts page is among the most impressive Iâ€™ve ever seen. 6000+ packages require it to run, and as many to build.
