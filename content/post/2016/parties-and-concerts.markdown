I like people, and adore others, but *hate* parties. I like music, and adore certain artists, but I *hate* concerts.

Overwhelmingly, my favourite time is the immediate aftermath of such events; walking home proud of myself that I went, but awash with relief that it's over.

Maybe that pride is misplaced. Now that I'm 30, I don't pretend liking sport or getting wasted. I don't care. Maybe it's also time to pretend to stop liking these social events as well.

I don't think its an introversion thing; it's just personal taste.

<p style="font-style:italic;"><strong>ASIDE:</strong> For those thinking I'm passing judgement on them for liking such events, re-read that previous sentence.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;"><strong>ASIDE:</strong> The <a href="https://rubenerd.com/kuala-lumpur-international-airport-wifi-is-sweet/">Haruhi anime</a> was ten years ago. I feel overwhelmed with nostalgia and feeling-oldness. There will be a post about that soon.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;"><strong>ASIDE:</strong> This is the third aside. “Rock in the Live!”</p>
