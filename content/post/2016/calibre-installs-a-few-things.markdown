I'm cleaning out my apartment, including donating most of my books because I don't have space. It's a little heartbreaking. Which reminds me, I was going to make a post about stuff I want to be given a good home.

Anyway, to render the excerise easier mentally, I'm sourcing ebooks for all of them, and using Calibre to organise them. It installs a few things!

    $ brew cask install calibre
