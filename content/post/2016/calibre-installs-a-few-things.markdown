I'm cleaning out my apartment, including donating a ton of my books to save valuable space. It's a little heartbreaking, I won't lie.

To render the excerise easier mentally, I'm sourcing ebooks for as many of them as I can, and I'm going to try Calibre to organise them. It installs a few things!

    $ brew cask install calibre
