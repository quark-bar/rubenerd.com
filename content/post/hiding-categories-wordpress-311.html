<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/logo.wp.blue.png" alt="" style="height:150px; width:150px; float:right; margin:0 0 0 10px;" class="transparent" />Starting with WordPress 3.1.1, my previously discussed <a title="2009.06.08 - Excluding WordPress categories" href="http://rubenerd.com/excluding-wp-categories/">functions.php method</a> for hiding posts filed in certain categories works again, and <a title="2011.03.02 - Hiding categories in WordPress 3.1" href="http://rubenerd.com/hiding-categories-wordpress-31/">the latest workaround</a> with RYO Category Visibility 3.0beta-9 is now broken.</p>
<p>There must have been a bug in WordPress 3.1 that prevented the former from working, which the latter worked around. Perhaps this:</p>
<blockquote><p>WordPress 3.1.1: [â€¦] Fixes for various query and taxonomy edge cases that caused some plugin compatibility issues</p>
</blockquote>
