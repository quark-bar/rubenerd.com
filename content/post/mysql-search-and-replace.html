summary: "Getting the syntax of REPLACE() right."

<p>This is one of those things I'm constantly forgetting, especially since I use Postgres for most of my work.</p>

<p>To replace the occurance of a string in a field with another, use the following. This replaces the value of the field with the value of the field where a text substitution has taken place:</p>

<pre>
MariaDB [DB]&gt; UPDATE table 
    -&gt; SET field=REPLACE(field,'original','replacement');
</pre>

<p>The MariaDB site lists <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/replace/">further details.</p>
