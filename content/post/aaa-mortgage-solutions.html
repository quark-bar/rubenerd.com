<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but I don&#39;t really consider a company reputable if their website looks unprofessional or haphazard. These days there really isn&#39;t an excuse for any company to have a cheesy, low budget website, and corportations should be viewing their site design as being as critical to their image as other aspects of their marketing.</p>
<p>Case in point, the <a href="http://aaams.com.au/">AAA Mortgage Solutions</a> Australia site. Their website doesn&#39;t look old fashioned, it doesn&#39;t look difficult to use, it just looks rubbish. I sure as hell wouldn&#39;t part money with a company that looks like this, let alone one which is designed purely to provide financial services.</p>
<p>Of course, it also doesn&#39;t help when your company&#39;s logo looks cheesy and was obviously named back when people actually still used the <a href="http://yellowpages.com.au/">Yellow Pages</a> so they would be sorted above their competition.</p>
<p>Its all a bit hard to swallow. Maybe I should just open my mouth like the doc asked and say &quot;AAAâ€¦&quot;</p>
