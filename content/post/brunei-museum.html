<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brunei_museum.JPG"><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/photo.kurun.brunei.museum.jpg" alt="Brunei Museum, Kota Batu, Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei by Kurun on Wikipedia" style="height:300px; width:500px; display:inline;" /></a></p>
<p>The Brunei Museum in Bandar Seri Begawan is either contained in an incredibly vast building, or Brunei is even smaller than I thought it was! HA!</p>
<p>I grew up in Singapore and lived in Malaysia but have never been to Brunei despite it being next door, so to speak. Because of a currency arrangement you can spend Singapore Dollars in Brunei and vica versa, and because I&#39;m a typographic nerd I noticed the fonts used on road signs there are the same as in Singapore too. I&#39;m a wild person!</p>
