<p>It wouldn&#39;t have been hard to top <a href="http://kirinyan.net/" title="Kirinyan">Clara&#39;s</a> birthday last year. I&#39;d <a href="http://rubenerd.com/i-broke-ground-on-sunday-with-my-ankle/" title="Rubénerd: I broke ground on Sunday, with my ankle!">broke my ankle</a> a few days prior. Infinitely worse however, she had an exam on the exact day. I mean really, how positively evil is that?</p>
<p>Suffice to say, this weekend was far nicer. We had Taiwanese tea and food with friends, caught an exhibition at the PowerHouse Museum, goofed around at home and exchanged more <em>Nemuneko</em> than perhaps one should!</p>
<p>I&#39;m back at my VMs this evening, but just wanted to send one final warm Happy Birthday to Clara. The competition is less than steep once more, but you would look <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p1099/" title="Rubénerd: I&#39;m 22, but I won&#39;t wear one!">infinitely nicer in a tutu</a> than me. ♡</p>
