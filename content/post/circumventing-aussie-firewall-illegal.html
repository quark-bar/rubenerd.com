<blockquote><p>Communications Minister Stephen Conroy yesterday confirmed his department was hosting a private online forum to discuss controversial issues about the filter with internet service providers (ISPs) â€” including the possibility of making it an offence to promote methods of circumventing the filter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did I miss something, or did Conroy <a title="ZDNet Australia article: Pirate Party fiery on circumvention ban by Renai LeMay" href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/pirate-party-fiery-on-circumvention-ban-339302797.htm">just admit</a> that a mandatory internet filter could be circumvented and therefore laws need to be introduced to make up for its failure? No, surely it can&#39;t be that simple.</p>
