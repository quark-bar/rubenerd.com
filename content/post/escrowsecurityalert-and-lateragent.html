<p>Looking at my system processes on Mavericks, two I didn&#39;t recognise caught my eye. Though I doubt <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69O4PXzAQ5Y" title="Dean Martin is rolling in his grave over this post">that&#39;s amore</a>.</p>
<h3>EscrowSecurityAlert</h3>
<p>This sounded more like a service I&#39;d request upon having to transact with a schady [sic] character. According to <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/message/23831594#23831594">tyler8541</a> on the Apple Support Communities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve taken a (very) brief look at the EscrowSecurityAlert application&#39;s code and it appears to sync your icloud keychain information. The whole process also looks like it might sync other settings with iCloud as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>LaterAgent</h3>
<p>I originally read this as <em>&quot;latté agent&quot;</em>. While serving perhaps an equally important purpose to caffeination, part of me was a little disappointed. From Commodore <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=18330771&amp;postcount=4">CSixty4</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LaterAgent is an internal library used for system updates. It&#39;s what&#39;s responsible for nagging you to install updates when you tell it to remind you later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both these services have appeared on my Mac Pro, but I&#39;ve yet to see either on my MacBook Air.</p>
<p style="font-style:italic">The <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/3824604677/">above photo is of Tokiha Mai</a> looking somewhat bemused at the state of my floor in 2009. That cup would need neither an escrow or an iCloud keychain, and I doubt its lack of coffee or sugar would render it impressed with a latté agent. Besides, a later agent would just make it go cold.</p>
