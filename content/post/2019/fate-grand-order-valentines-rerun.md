Happy Sunday! It's been a month since Valentines, which means at least as many days since Clara and I were playing the *[Fate/Grand Order]* [Valentine Revival] event on the world's [favourite] mobile game. It seems the most [recent Music Monday] wasn't the only horribly delayed post.

I blogged about the event [first time], so I feel it's incumbent upon me to post for the revival/rerun/repeat. *Incumbent* never looks like its spelled correctly, like *cucumber* or *cactus*. Maybe that's just me. We start with the [Saberface] contingent!

Musashi had the best reaction. I was surprised they translated *takoyaki* to *dumpling* in the game, but both are great!

And reactions from those with the most ridiculous accessories, which presumaly would have made creating chocolate all but impossible:

Sc√°tach's comment about her alcoholic beverage offer reminded me just how much alcohol is displayed in the game. And yet, they're always careful to point out that only adults should be engaged in actually drinking it! Compare that to Cartoon Network euphemistically portraying Mordecai and Rigby drinking soft drink, or The Simpsons showing beer as a crutch.

But I think Martha wins this time around :).
