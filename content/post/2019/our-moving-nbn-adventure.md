Australia's National Broadband Network (NBN) was envisaged with the same  foresight that gave us a phone system and power grid. Other jurisdictions were able to pull this off with economies of scale and fibre optics, but it was politicised in Australia into an expensive hodgepodge with electronic gauge breaks, three word slogans, and greenfield copper.

But I digress! This is my page to track the progress of moving our NBN connection to our new address.

Time to transfer as of the 19th February: two weeks.

*Update: @Zoomosis pointed out my dates all said 2018, not 2019. The NBN may take a significant amount of time to provision, but at least it hasn't been an entire year.*
