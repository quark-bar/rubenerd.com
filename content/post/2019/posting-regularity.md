Probably the worst kept secret of this blog is I often write posts in bulk, then post them over the following week. I love writing, but I prefer to post once or twice a day instead of twenty times on a given Saturday. My current job also absorbs my mental capacity and time during the week. 

This approach does come at a cost to timeliness, but people aren't reading this site hoping to get scoops or minute-by-minute analysis. Unless you're a turtle, in which case can I say your shell looks rather fabulous today. üê¢

Long-term bloggers, what's your trick to keeping posts regular? Or is this an artificial problem, and I should just blurt out stuff in bulk when I feel like it? What's your electronic fibre? I could have thought of a less awful metaphor there.
