Today's [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday) I found via the Technology Connection channel. It's one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. *D-D-D-DiscoVision!*

We had a LaserDisc player in Singapore, but admittedly they were bigger there and Japan than the rest of the world. Bigger in terms of popularity, and the physical size of the disks. *Glaven*.
