ufotable is [hosting a café event] for the *Fate/Stay Night Heaven's Feel* movie series, and included the above image of everyone's favourite star from it despite it not being her story arc or anything important like that!

@JamieJakov likes a good *tsundere*, or at least he and I used to, if I had endless money I'd fly the both of us out for this to make up for missing his birthday yesterday as well. Happy birthday too, my friend ♡.

*I would have included this supplied sample image on Tumblr, but they would have just [auto-blocked] it.*
