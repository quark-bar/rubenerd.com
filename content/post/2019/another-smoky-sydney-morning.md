Today makes [Tuesday](https://rubenerd.com/a-smoky-sydney-morning/) look like a walk in the park. Which it was, because I have to walk through the park in the Domain to get to work. I couldn't even see the skyline or the Opera House coming across the Harbour Bridge this morning.

Stay safe everyone, and maybe carry a gas mask.
