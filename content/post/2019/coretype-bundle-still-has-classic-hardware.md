It's felt as though the Mac has been losing some of its charm, like the startup chime and the classic Finder icon. But I'm relieved and happy to see the `CoreTypes.bundle` still has all the New World ROM and Intel Macs, in high resolution glory.

Here are my first and latest Mac portables, an iBook Snow and the latest MacBook Pro. I like they're also displayed with the best desktop background Apple ever shipped:
