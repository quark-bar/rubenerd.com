Keith Sibley discussed the immersed tube construction of the [Boston Big Dig] for a documentary I was watching. This quote stood out:

> It went very predictably. The result of a job looking easy and going well is good planning. 

The rest of the project went [somewhat less well]. But I love the quote; I want to put it on my desk at work.
