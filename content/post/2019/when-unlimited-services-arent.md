I'm automatically weary of any online services that refer to either size or time as unlimited. Leaving aside it's physical impossibility, or that trickery is usually employed to constrain you in other ways, they have a near perfect track record of reneging. It's bait and switch 101.

We should be encouraging sustainable, honest business models, so companies like this don't feel like they have to do race-to-the-bottom tactics like this to compete.
