Yesterday I was where every self-respecting person would be having just moved: buried under Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi routers, and inexplicably-vague manuals. The good news is I finally bit the bullet and installed OpenWRT a try on our router; I'm already kicking myself it too me this long.

I decided to give a new hotspot a quick test, but macOS would have none of it:

This is a fantastic feature. If a malicious actor is man-in-the-middling, or otherwise futzing around with networking gear, this should give any client pause. There wouldn't be any practical reason a target network would *downgrade* its security. I don't use Wi-Fi on my FreeBSD boxes, but now I'm intrigued to try the same experiment on those.

I would have posted about a Wi-Fi network called *Tohsaka* on Tumblr, but they would have just [flagged the post] as adult material, as they did with [this cute one by @Keyyui]:
