It's [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday/) time once again. Today we have the first song on Colin Bass's beautiful 2015 album *At Wild End*.

It's a good question; I'd like to think I'd largely be the same. Or would I be? Wasn't it B.J. Neblett who said we are the sum total of our experiences? I feel this is a topic worthy of its own post and reflection.

I'll always know Colin Bass by his alternate stage name Sabah Habas Mustapha, for his *Denpasar Moon* album. The bulk of my sister's and my childhood soundtrack consisted of that and the Michael Franks discography. Forgive me for use of the term, but *juxtiposing* that dulcet Indonesian instrumentation with Colin sitting in rural northern Wales years later made me smile.

I haven't blogged nearly enough about his music. I will correct this.
