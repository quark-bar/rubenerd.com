They're often a bit clich√©, but there are always a few forum signatures that justify their existence with something profound or at least mildly interesting. Here are some of the latter:

* "There are no mysteries, only a lack of information."

* "There are no miracles, only unknown scientific facts."

* "The Doors of Wisdom are now open to everyone without exception."

* "The only way forwards is not backwards, unless you're travelling on a circular path, which on Earth is all but inevitable, unless you're a flat earther, in which case you've lost a dimension and think pizzas are the width of noodles."

* "Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe."

* "He who doesn't want to see is afraid of discovering."

Okay I admit, they were all transcribed from the [same signature] except for one which I blatantly made up. I'll leave as an exercise for the reader to guess which.
