Here's another to add to my increasing list of online anti-patterns. If you go to a website, say Scribd, and click the ***Download*** link, you're asked to sign up or log in. This... is not downloading the document! Therefore, the link isn't misleading, it's outright lying. What it should say is ***Sign In to Download***; but we all know why they don't.

The related anti-pattern appears on software download sites that run advertisements with giant ***Download*** buttons. There's only one reason they do this, and I won't insult your intelligence spelling it out!
