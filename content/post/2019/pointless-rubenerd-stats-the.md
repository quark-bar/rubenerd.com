I've written 179 posts starting with the word *The* in their titles. These represent the following percentage of posts:

    $ perl -e 'printf("%.2f%%", 100 * 179 / 6151)'
    ==> 2.91%

They also represent 100% of posts that begin the word *The*, surprising though it may seem. Some other pointless facts:

* This post, ironically enough, does not start with the word *The*.

* My [first ever post] did.

* The first in alphabetical order was [The 80586 Pentium] from 2018, and the last was [The Zip Insider] from 2017, also on electronic nostalgia. I may have a problem.

* [The Sims 2: Fixing Sound, Universal Binary, MacBook Pro] from 2006 had the longest title, and is one of the oldest.

* Only two [grilled cheese sandwich] posts start with *The*, from 2008 and 2009.

I learned something today. Not from this post, mind.
