I haven't done a [Pet Shop Boys](https://rubenerd.com/tag/pet-shop-boys/) edition of [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday/) for a while. This is one of my favourite songs from the Pet Shop Boys album *Behaviour*. I mean, it's one of my favourite songs in general, and it's one of my favourite songs from *Behaviour*.
