It's [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday/) time again, that time of the week where I engage in writing redundant sentences to explain the day of the week and the type of post a Music Monday entry is. 

My dad introduced me to [Emerson, Lake & Palmer's](http://emersonlakepalmer.com/) adaptation of Aaron Copland's composition growing up, and it's still one of my favourite songs. I'd never heard the full cut before though, and it's glorious.

Us commoners all need a little fanfare every now and then.
