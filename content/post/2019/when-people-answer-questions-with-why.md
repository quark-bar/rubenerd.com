I was searching for Subversion web frontends and [found this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1658406/is-there-an-open-source-web-based-self-hosted-revision-control-system). Some of the comments were exactly what you'd expect.

> Why the hell would you like to check in/check out files through a web interface (if I understand well your question)? 

Why the hell indeed! Fire and brimstone and a use case I don't have sufficient empathy to understand!

> It sounds like could use any regular VCS (judging by your edit) - why does it have to be web-based? Why do you want to check files in/out via the web?

Oh for Pete's sake. Merlin Mann responds with such questions by asking why he's not a potted fern; I think we should all adopt that.

*Update*: Turns out, I wrote about this [back in 2013](https://rubenerd.com/whats-wrong-with-technical-answer-sites/).
