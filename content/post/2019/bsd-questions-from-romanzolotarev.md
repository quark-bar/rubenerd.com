@romanzolotarev asked two great questions last week. The first was on which [stack we use](https://twitter.com/romanzolotarev/status/1121109695014502400)\:

1. *BSD, sh, vi üê°üòà*   
2. *Linux, Bash, Vim üêß*    
3. *something else (reply)*

I use 1 and 2 professionally, no prizes for guessing which I prefer. I stopped preinstalling Vim on BSD servers and use stock nvi and sh. My workstations have other combinations:

* Work laptop and personal Mac: macOS, ksh, Vim
* Work bhyve box: FreeBSD, ksh, nvi
* Personal laptop and tower: FreeBSD, ksh, Vim
* Personal tinkering VM and vintage boxes: NetBSD, ksh, nvi

And on [keyboards](https://twitter.com/romanzolotarev/status/1122012194202365952), the options were:

1. *built-in, stock keyboard*   
2. *external, upgraded*   
3. *I don't use a keyboard*

I'm on call most times, and like working from coffee shops, so I use 1. It's difficult with the godawful Mac butterfly keyboards, so thesedays I blog with a tiny Panasonic Let's Note. At desks I do 2 using:

* Work: KBtalKing with Cherry MX Browns
* Home: Leopold FC660 with Topres, the world's greatest switches.
