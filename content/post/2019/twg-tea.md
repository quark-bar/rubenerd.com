What's your first thought when you see the date on a logo or building? I assume it signifies when either the company or building came into existence, or perhaps at least a predecessor. I wonder how one can be a *post-decessor*, or a *present-decessor?*

My boss shared this Singaporean artisan tea merchant, and specifically the hot water they steeped themselves in [with their logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TWG_Tea_logo.jpg) in Hong Kong. Wikipedia quoted an article from the [Straits Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWG_Tea#Naming_lawsuit):

> A judge handling the lawsuit noted in July 2013 that the use of the "existence of the date 1837 in TWG Tea's sign has led people to believe that the company was established at that time", while in actuality it was founded much later, in 2008. In justification, the firm's spokespeople claimed that it was instead a tribute to the "year when the Chamber of Commerce was founded in Singapore"

I'm tempted to change the tagline of my blog from *2004-ish* to *mid-1980s-ish* then, by that logic. I preface my own claims with *-ish* because I only blogged three times in 2004, so even *that* felt like a stretch.
