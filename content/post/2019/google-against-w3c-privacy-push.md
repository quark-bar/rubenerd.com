[This Bloomberg report](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-24/google-blocks-privacy-push-at-the-group-that-sets-web-standards) has been making the rounds, as it should:

> The Alphabet Inc unit was the only member of the World Wide Web Consortium to vote against the measure to expand the power of the organisation's Internet privacy group, according to a tally of the results viewed by Bloomberg News. Twenty four organisations voted for the idea in a recent poll.

The article also repeats some interesting language I've been seeing in a lot of such reports, emphasis added:

> The debate hasn't been confined to the W3C. The Safari and Firefox browsers now block third-party tracking cookies - little bits of code that let advertisers follow users around the web with targeted ads. But Google decided not to do this, opting instead to **give Chrome browser users more control** over which cookies can track them. 

This logic is how we end up with Orwellian names like AdChoices.
