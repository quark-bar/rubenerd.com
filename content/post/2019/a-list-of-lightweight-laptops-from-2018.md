I compiled a list of ultra-lightweight laptops back in January 2018 when I was researching what to replace my secondary personal device with. These are all likely outdated, but sharing here in case anyone finds this useful.

I tried to only include devices with at least a HiDPI or Retina-grade display, because Apple has spoiled me. So the ASUS ZenBooks and most of the Toshibas from the time weren't included.
