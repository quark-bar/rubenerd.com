Back in October I played [Nero Fest 2018] in everyone's favourite mobile game, *[Fate/Grand Order]*. I got three more copies of my beloved Umu, but as I lamented in the post: *"I didn’t get Nero Bride."*

This was not through lack of trying; Clara and I must have attempted to summon here at least a quadrillion times, give or take. My public face was one of delight and joy to have been able to NP ascend Umu, but I was dejected that my favourite Saber's alternative version didn't appear.

So fast forward to this evening. I have bronchitis, am feeling lethargic from medicine, and am tired from waking up coughing all night. I saw the *[Fate CCC Pre-Release Campaign]* had started, with a limited chance to summon her again. *Why not*, I thought with the energy of a wilted piece of lettuce.

So I hit the *10× Summon button*, and returned to watching those oddly comforting [tailed logs] on another screen.

The pseudo-random number generators on those remote servers had entropy fed from most favourable sources this evening. Look at me trying to mask my excitement; I can't believe I got her!
