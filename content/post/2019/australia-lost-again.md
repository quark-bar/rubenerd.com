Early election results indicate Australia has elected in its right-wing Coalition again. The polls all indicated a wipeout, but they were howlingly wrong. As Joseph de Maistre opined, every nation gets the government it deserves.

I've threatened to stop talking about politics here a few times. But I'm truly done.

As I said on Twitter, it's also time to do some soul searching. I moved back to Australia with family, but I'm increasingly not seeing a future for myself here. I think deep down I already knew it, but this is confirmation. Where to go next?
