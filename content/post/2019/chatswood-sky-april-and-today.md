I haven't done a [bushfire](https://rubenerd.com/tag/bushfires/) smoke post for at least a few days, so it's time to rectify this. Here's the view from the walkway near our apartment building in Chatswood [back in April](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bv_HHein49n/), a northern suburb of Sydney:

And the same view earlier today:

This is the first day of this smoky ordeal that my breathing has been laboured. I'm still probably recovering from my lung scare earlier this year, so this couldn't have helped. Fun *COUGH* times.
