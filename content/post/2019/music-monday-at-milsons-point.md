I had reason today to go to a clinic in Milsons Point, which gave me a bit of time to wander around the shore across from the Sydney CBD. It reminded me of this verse from Michael Franks' *[Jardin Botanico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_JLh9UElEM)* from *[Tiger in the Rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_in_the_Rain)*, my favourite album of all time:

> Fly to the Southern Hemisphere;   
> Where the sky is clear.   
> I abandoned the bleak, December chill;   
> There's nothing like Christmas in Brazil.   
> The weather's completely upside down;   
> When we touch down.

It's our turn for winter down here, though while we've had [kangaroos jumping in snow](https://twitter.com/stephengrenfel1/status/1160605617838366721) recently, the sea breeze was far gentler on the coast today. It was quite pretty.

Here's the view down the street towards the city:

Then having walked under the bridge to the other side:

And waiting for the train trip home:
