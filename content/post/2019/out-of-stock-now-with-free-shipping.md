A certain retail site shows these under an item I'm watching:

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/ebay-out-of-stock.jpg" alt="" style="width:150px; float:right; margin:0 0 1em 2em" /></p>

> **eBay note:** This item is out of stock
>  
> **eBay note:** 12% off + free postage â€“ hurry! Your watched item is now on sale with free postage.

Out of stock, 12% off, and free postage, *with free postage!* How much will that cost though? Can I customise my out of stock item, or will that impact my free postage with free postage and 12% off the item that's out of stock?
