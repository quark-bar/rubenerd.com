It's [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday/ "Posts tagged with Music Monday") once again. I don't know much about [this band or song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhIHMDpbQDI "C2C - Genius feat. Gush"), all I know is a colleague has played it bunch of times, and I misheard the lyric as "jitters". I thought he was saying I drank too much coffee.
