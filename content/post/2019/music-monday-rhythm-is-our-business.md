It's [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday) time! I absolutely adore John Pizzarelli, as you've no doubt been able to tell from my years of blogging about him. His guitar and soft voice are always beautiful and just that little bit cheeky.

This is my favourite rendition of that big band classic, with all the winking and smiles you can hear as he introuces members of his band.

His recent tribute album *[Sinatra & Jobim @ 50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinatra_%26_Jobim_@_50)* may be one of my new favourites, but his 1997 *<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Love_Is_Here_to_Stay_(album)">Our Love is Here to Stay</a>* will always remain the most special to me. You can check out a live performance of *[Avalon](https://rubenerd.com/john-pizzarelli-avalon/)* that I blogged about back in 2012 from the same album.
