My coffee shop posts have been unexpectedly popular, so have this photo from the Everyday Canteen in Artarmon. It's a leisurely stroll away from Chatswood in Sydney's north, and has amazing breakfast and coffee.

I'm really liking Artarmon the more I wander around here. The Japanese supermarkets down by the station have a great selection of stuff, and the whole suburb is leafy and nice.
