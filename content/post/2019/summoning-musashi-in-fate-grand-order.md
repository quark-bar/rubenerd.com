My *[Fate/Grand Order]* luck has been hit and miss of late. I [summoned Ishtar] who I wanted from the start, but I didn't get the angelically handsome and supremely useful Merlin, or the [Bride version] of everyone's favourite Umu from last year.

I only had thirty saint quartz, so I could only perform one full summon. When that failed to materialise anything, I cashed in mana prisms for a few summoning tickets to try again. Chances were slim, but worth a shot.

You could say, my reaction was:
