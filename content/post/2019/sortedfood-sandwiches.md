The SortedFood gents had some great sandwich filling recipes which Clara and I are going to try this week. This is their [tuna mayo sandwich] filling:

* 1 stick celery
* 1 160g tin tuna, in spring water
* 4 tablespoons mayonnaise
* 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 teaspoon lemon zest
* 1 tablespoon salted butter, softened
* 4 slices soft wholemeal bread
* 1 handful watercress; I'm going to try alfalfa as well

And their [egg mayo sandwich]:

* 4 eggs
* 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
* 3 tablespoons mayonnaise
* A pinch of cayenne pepper; I'm going to try paprika
* 1/2 teaspoon malt vinegar
* 2 tablespoons watercress
* 1 tablespoon salted butter

The celery and cayenne pepper look like the standout secondary ingredients. My sandwich fillings have tended towards the bland side. Nobody made them like my mum or dad could.
