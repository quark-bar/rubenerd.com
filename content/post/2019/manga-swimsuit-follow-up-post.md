Long-time *Rubenerd* reader Rebecca Hales – no relation to Halestrom other than sharing a fabulous name – asked where I'd got up to with the fitness post I'd [promised](https://rubenerd.com/hes-back/) back in June. Her question wasn't entirely selfless, as she contributed material to it and was obviously getting antsy at seeing it posted on this *esteemed* publication. I may have performed a little embellishment in the description there, and by that I mean a lot.

*(Not alot, that's an [entirely different beast](https://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything/). I feel between that and [gotten](https://rubenerd.com/gotten/) we're fighting a losing battle, but one can dream).*

I wrote about [Clara and I wanting this Arena gear](https://rubenerd.com/we-almost-got-arena-manga-swimsuits/) back in April, as part of our push to get more exercise and be healthier:

> Little did we know we could have been weeby at the latter as well. Introducing the Arena Manga One Piece! ... Arena has a range of manga themed outfits, complete with darumas, seigaiha patterns, maneki cats, and a Great Wave off Kanagawa, among other Japanese motifs.

This is what the ladies outfit looks like, as worn by a model whom the photographer decided to catch sneezing. *Gesundheit!*

Rebecca commented within a longer email thread that she thought the design was cute, but that it came with a caveat:

> I would be careful recommending that swimsuit for Clara because it's uncomfortable. I like the open back but I've worn the same [style] and the shoulder straps are very thin and cut my shoulders quickly when diving :P

I haven't had to contend with this as a gentleman, but I'll take it under advisement. Now this has been pointed out, I can see the other people in the image above have more sane straps. Maybe they were causing her to sneeze, who knows?!
