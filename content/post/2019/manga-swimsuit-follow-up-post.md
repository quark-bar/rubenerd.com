Long-time *Rubenerd* reader Rebecca Hales – no relation to William Hales who also sends awesome comments – asked where I'd got up to with the fitness post I'd [promised](https://rubenerd.com/hes-back/) three months ago. Her question wasn't entirely selfless, as she contributed material to it and was obviously getting antsy at seeing it posted on this *esteemed* publication. I may have performed a little embelishment in the description ehre.

I wrote about [Clara and I wanting this Arena gear](https://rubenerd.com/we-almost-got-arena-manga-swimsuits/) back in April:

> Little did we know we could have been weeby at the latter as well. Introducing the Arena Manga One Piece! ... Arena has a range of manga themed outfits, complete with darumas, seigaiha patterns, maneki cats, and a Great Wave off Kanagawa, among other Japanese motifs.

This is what the ladies' outfit looks like, which will be important in a second:

Rebecca commented within a longer email thread about something I hadn't considered, because it's something as a male I would not have had to contend with:

> I would be careful recommending that swimsuit for Clara because it's uncomfortable. I like the open back but I've worn the same [swimsuit style] and the very thin shoulder straps cut my shoulders quickly when diving :P

She directed me to the FINA diving channel on YouTube – who knew? – where, sure enough, all the people are wearing suits with much thicker straps.

I doubt Clara and I will be doing any strenuous training in the pool *at all*, but if there's a downside to this style, we'll stick with the ones we [already bought](https://rubenerd.com/no-speedo-patterns-for-gents/). Lesson learned, thank you!
