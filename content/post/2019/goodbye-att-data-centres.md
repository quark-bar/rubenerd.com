I saw this fly by my inbox this morning:

> AT&T no longer operates the colocation services. Evoque is now responsible for the operations at the data center. Evoque will deliver the services listed below to the transferred colocation customers:  
>   
> * Raised floor, space, cages, racks, and similar components.  
> * HVAC and other environmental controls  
> * Power  
> * Remote Hands  
> * Cross-Connects  
> * Data Center access control and physical security  

Pictured above is a Range Rover Evoque by [M 93 on Wikimedia Commons], that presumably isn't what AT&T sold to, hence its inclusion here is entirely pointless.
