Remember [Josh Nunn]? He was the gentleman who sent me his vintage computer that I unboxed on the [Commodore 128 episode]. He has some feedback on my [use of week numbers].

> But seriously, no one starts their week numbers on a Sunday, and **no one** considers the first full week as week 1 which is the way %U works.

I suppose he's one of these monsters who pipes up at parties that the 21st century didn't *actually* start until 2001, or that everyone should count their groceries from zero because that's how arrays start. I'd use a *[linked shopping list]*... oh man, that was good.

But being technically correct is the best kind of correct, and he's right. I've always started my week numbers on a [Sunday]. I'd also always assumed the first week is week one, as implied by the word *first*. What next, we should call them a *pant* rather than *pants*?

> %V is where it's at - ISO 8601. What are you going to blog next week - dates should be written '02/28/2019'?!

But that's just an extra level of cruel. I write all my dates with `YYYY-MM-DD` because I like to think of myself as a standards-compliant gentleman, but tying that back to my hypocrisy about my use of week numbers was a one-two punch. I consider myself schooled.

He also pointed out:

> And while I've got your attention, while I know you [specifically love printf] because it doesn't do newlines by default, getting your email address from your about page might prove tricky to a n00b.

True! It's another, perhaps slightly evil, extra spam filter.
