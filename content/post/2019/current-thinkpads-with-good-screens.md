Sometimes I window shop [MacBooks and ThinkPads](https://rubenerd.com/thinkpads-and-macbooks/) for FreeBSD, even if I have no intention or money to buy one yet. I've been spoiled by MacBook Retina screens for photos and shells, but most ThinkPads don't have an equivalent. That's fine though; MacBooks don't have an equivalent keyboard... oh snap.

These are the current models that claim to have a minimum 2× HiDPI display option. Some I clicked through every single SKU and still couldn't customise them with the display they claim to have; but they seem to change fairly regularly.
