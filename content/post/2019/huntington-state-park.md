I was reading Wikipedia's article about New York, then ended up in Connecticut, which lead me to Fairfield County, and this beautiful photo by [AskJoanne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Huntington-Park.jpg) taken at the Huntington State Park in Redding. No relation to Otis, who was born in Georgia. No relation to the country.

I think I have a new desktop background candidate for my work phone, it's impossible not to feel calm looking at this.
