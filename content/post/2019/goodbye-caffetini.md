Today we bid farewell to the *Caffetini* in Ultimo, across the street from our Sydney office. Among their coffee options, they also had the best [chicken salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasoned_salt#Chicken_salt) chips in the area, and was a nice place to chill. [Their website](http://caffetini.com.au/) still resolves.

I remember going there several years ago when Clara was having a job interview in a neighbouring building. This is mildly interesting, because when Clara had an interview near [another cafe in Mascot](https://rubenerd.com/when-you-find-yourself-at-cafe-neo/), we ended up working in the same building.

I wonder if Clara can have an interview near a coffee shop in Singapore or Hong Kong next? Even with all the latter's troubles, I still want to work from there for a while next.
