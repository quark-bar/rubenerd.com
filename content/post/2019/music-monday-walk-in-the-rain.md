It's [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday) time. Each and every Monday without fail, except when I fail, I post a piece of music in the hopes we can share in its musicness. I shouldn't write these so early in the morning.

Today's song is *Walk in the Rain*, one of the especially beautiful songs from Michael Franks' 1999 album *Dragonfly Summer*. You can peruse its [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_Summer) if you so wish, I wrote it!

I mention it today because I realised I've misheard one of the lyrics for two decades. Wow, is that how long it's been since 1999? I had always thought he was singing *with our umbrellas*, but an inspection of the liner notes reveals it's *without umbrellas*.

It's just like when I got my first monitor headphones, and I heard instruments in some of his music I'd never heard before.
