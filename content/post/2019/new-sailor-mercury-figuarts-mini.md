There's a new Figuarts Mini of everyone's favourite *Sailor Moon* character, due to be released in November. She's only 9cm tall, so my usual concern about getting rid of clutter is even harder to justify. All she's missing is her [compact computer and visor](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sailor+mercury+portable+computer&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images "DuckDuckGo image search for her portable computer")!

You may see the homage to her that Clara drew into Rubi here too.

Capitalisation is my only concern with these: they insist on writing them the same way Apple does with *Mac Mini*. And like that device, I refuse to conform.
