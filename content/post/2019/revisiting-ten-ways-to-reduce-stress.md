A decade ago I [reviewed](https://rubenerd.com/krizia-reduce-stress/) an article about [reducing stress](https://www.dumblittleman.com/10-ways-to-reduce-stress-without/) by the *Dumb Little Man*. I thought it'd be fun to see how much of it still holds.

1. **Turn off the TV**: I'd apply this to Twitter now too.<p></p>

2. **Go for a walk**: Still holds.<p></p>

3. **Call up a friend**: I'm an introvert, but I still don't do this often enough.<p></p>

4. **Take advantage of free events**: Ditto.<p></p>

5. **Hang out at your favorite bookstore**: These mythical places have almost ceased to exist, but I do this at coffee shops with a Kindle or my RSS reader.<p></p>

6. **De-clutter your home**: I didn't think much of this at the time, but this is absolutely gigantically *huge*. There is something supremely satisfying and calming about going through junk and throwing it away. If you're asking yourself if you need something, you've already answered it.<p></p>

7. **Treat yourself to a hot bubble bath by candlelight**: Not my cup of tea personally. That's the next one.<p></p>

8. **Brew a special cup of tea or coffee and sit down in your favorite chair**: Many times this.<p></p>

9. **Bake your favorite cookies or your favorite cake**: Not when you're giving up sugar. But homemade food is great.<p></p>

10. **Update your photo album**: I'm back to just hierarchies of photos in folders with thumbnail images, but this is still a great exercise. One day I'll have an Apple Aperture replacement.
