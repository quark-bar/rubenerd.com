In no particular order:

* [Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria) overtook South Africa to become Africa's largest economy in 2014.

* [Carrefour](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/carrefour) is a French/Norman word for crossroads. I used to go to one of their hypermarkets at Suntec City in Singapore back in the day.

* `about:mozilla` in the latest Firefox references [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) with *"the Beast fashioned new structures from oxidised metal and proclaimed their glories."*

* `HISTTIMEFORMAT` [should be defined](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/97983/histtimeformat-modification-in-etc-bash-rc-or-etc-profile) in your local `.kshrc`, `.zshrc`, or equivalent.

* The median age of all the world's donkeys is probably somewhere in the middle.
