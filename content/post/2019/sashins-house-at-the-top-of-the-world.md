Bob Geldof ended his 1992 album *The Happy Club* with a spoken word song called *[The House at the Top of the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2YV4LQOi-8)*. My parents frequently played it.

Today we sat at the top of the world, this time at my friend [Sashin's](https://twitter.com/sashintweets) place on the outskirts of Sydney, with [Valty](https://twitter.com/valtism) and [Kiri](https://twitter.com/kirisviel). The sky and landscape both seemed to go on forever from this hill.
