It's [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/) once again, that time of the week where I discuss organised audible emissions. Today, [Van the Man regales us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc9J96f4cDk) with his times working in IT support:

> What's my line?   
> I'm happy cleanin' Windows&trade;   
> Take my time   
> I'll see you when my love grows   
> Baby don't let it slide   
> I'm a working man in my prime   
> Cleanin' Windows&trade;

I made decent pocket money in high school doing this. That and downgrading people's Windows Vista machines to XP or 2000 (and one to NT 4.0 if you can believe it), and replacing bloated AV with Avast and Lavasoft Ad-Aware. I might be dating myself more than I care to admit.

*Moondance* is by far my favourite Van Morrison song, but jokes aside I always thought this tune was especially optimistic and fun.
