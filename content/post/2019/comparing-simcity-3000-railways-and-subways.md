Karl Jobst's series of SimCity 3000 tips are almost twenty years old, but I still pick them up and learn something new. [Here's his comment about subways](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/pc/190488-simcity-3000/faqs/26663) in his Transport Department FAQ, emphasis added:

> When you're building a subway station, it must be next to, or directly above a subway rail. If you place a subway on top of a subway, the subway doesn't just reach a dead end. If you place subway rails on the other side the trains will just move through the station. **Not as many people use the subway as they do normal rails, don't ask me why, they just don't**. When building a subway station, I suggest building it away from a train station.

That jibes&mdash;jives?&mdash;with my experience as well, particularly with industrial zones that seem to not use subways at all. I used to save a ton of money specifically to build subways, but my most recent cities have all used above ground railways extensively, for two reasons:

1. They're not as ugly as I used to think they were, and in some cases can be made to look quite attractive with a row of small parks, sloping hills, and other landscaping.

2. Road traffic between industrial and residential areas are lighter with railway lines compared to a mix of rail and subways.

3. I like watching the trains running along!

4. As per Karl's observation, sims simply use railways more.

These days I tend to leave subways for CBDs, or where there's a land crunch. In my redesigned *Craterville* I terminated railway lines before my high density commercial district, with Subway-to-Rail connections at the edge.
