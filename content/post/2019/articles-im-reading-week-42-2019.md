What a delightful week number. Here's some stuff that's come through my RSS feed or Twitter over the last few days:

* [Robservatory: Remove macOS Catalina guilt trip from Mojave](https://robservatory.com/remove-the-macos-catalina-guilt-trip-from-macos-mojave/): I won't be upgrading my Macs to Catalina any time soon, for reasons that may make it into their own post. These few shell commands will get rid of the notification to upgrade in System Preferences.

* [Nikkei Asian Review: Typhoon Hagibis pummels Japan, leaving 2 dead; millions told to evacuate](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Natural-disasters/Typhoon-Hagibis-pummels-Japan-leaving-2-dead-millions-told-to-evacuate): I also read a bunch of friends in Japan feeling earthquakes at the same time. Friggen terrifying.

* [Tokyo Otaku Mode: Azur Lane Anime Releases Explosive Main Trailer](https://otakumode.com/news/5d80a7fd8828729c1a3acfbd/Azur-Lane-Anime-Releases-Explosive-Main-Trailer-Along-With-OP-ED-Artist-Info!): Everyone needs ship girls in their lives. Based off the ridiculously popular game, which I would play far too obsessively and therefore am avoiding like the plague.

* [ITPro: Google is able to access sensitive G Suite customer data](https://www.itpro.co.uk/privacy/34612/google-is-able-to-access-sensitive-g-suite-customer-data-former-employee-warns): There's no client-side encryption, so this shouldn't surprise anyone. This is a failure of education.

* [SoraNews24: Idol stalker figures out where his target lives from the reflection in her eyes in social media photo](https://www.itpro.co.uk/privacy/34612/google-is-able-to-access-sensitive-g-suite-customer-data-former-employee-warns): We used to mock CSI when they'd perform crystal-clear magnifications off the tiniest reflective surface. We're now in an age where there's sufficient resolution to do it for real now.


* [SGCafe: Sailor Moon now has official condoms to raise awareness against HIV and STDs](https://sgcafe.com/2019/10/sailor-moon-now-official-condoms-raise-awareness-hiv-stds/): They've done this before, and it's a great idea. Anything that makes safe sex more accessible is a net positive.

* [CNA: First Citizensâ€™ Panel session held to look at work-life harmony in Singapore](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/citizens-panel-session-work-life-harmony-first-11952808): The fact they're still being ordered as *work-life* is perhaps more telling than intended.
