It's [Music Monday] time! Each and every Monday without fail, except when I fail to, I post a piece of music or a song—XOR, no ambiguity here—such that our Monday may be filled with perhaps a little more joy than its unenviable position at the start of the work week would normally afford it.

Today we have this delightful duo of French songs I heard in a coffee shop this morning. The first is *Le Jazz Et Le Java* sung by Yves Montand, and *La Mer* with the instantly-recognisable Sacha Distel.

As an aside, I default to YouTube because its what everyone can access, but I'm thinking I should link to Spotify or Apple Music as well. I prefer to use YouTube for previewing songs, then buying albums on services like ZDigital/7Digital. [Let me know](https://twitter.com/rubenerd) if you have any thoughts.
