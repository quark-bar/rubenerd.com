[bhyvecon] and [AsiaBSDCon 2019] are over, and once again there's so much to discuss I have enough to easily fill a few dozen blog posts. So instead I'm going to be throughly unproductive and talk about our trip to *[The Guest]* in Ikebukuro.

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/photos/photo-2019-03-24-urusei-yatsura-poster@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/photos/photo-2019-03-24-urusei-yatsura-poster@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/photos/photo-2019-03-24-urusei-yatsura-poster@2x.jpg 2x" alt="" style="width:500px; height:333px;" /></p>

This month the café was themed around *Urusei Yatsura*, the smash-hit science fiction comedy and cult classic of the 1980s. I never read the manga, but the anime was one of my earliest experiences with Japanese pop culture and mythology. It's also an *incredible* time capsule into the decade, with the now-retro theme music and art style. Those cityscapes alone are amazing.

It was also the breakout series for Rumiko Takahashi, who ended up writing other touchstones including Ranma 1/2, Inuyasha, and Rinne. Her writing style and ability to weave Japanese history into modern popular culture has been imitated but never surpassed.

Clara and I already spent far too much in the gift shop, so we just got drinks. There was a one in ten shot of getting Lum on my coffee, and I did!

Being a fan of the series aside, I'm just happy that these classic shows are getting respect and attention they deserve, in spite of so much contemporary competition. There's no question *Urusei Yatsura* was a trailblazer.
