I recently dreamed that I was waiting for a train near a large office building. The tower seemed to shrink as I walked passed it down the platform, which I realised was due to it being slender in proportion to its length. Dreams being what they are, the only other thing I could remember was that it looked awfully 1970s, down to its brown windows and tan exterior.

Fast forward to today, and I was reading the Cape Town article on Wikipedia, like a gentleman. And low and behold, check out the [Cape Town Civic Centre](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cape_Town_Civic_Centre.jpg), as taken by [Vectorebus](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Vectorebus)\:

I feel as though it could have been a Starfleet building in one of the Kirk-era movies; maybe the Federation Academey of Sciences or something.
