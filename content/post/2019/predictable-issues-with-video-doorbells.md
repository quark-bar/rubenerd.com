Sam Biddle wrote [this article for The Intercept] about a brand of Internet-enabled video doorbell. You can probably guess what comes next.

> Ring has a history of lax, sloppy oversight when it comes to deciding who has access to some of the most precious, intimate data belonging to any person: a live, high-definition feed from around — and perhaps inside — their house.

I wasn't aware of other issues they've had, but if true I don't like where this is going.

> Beginning in 2016, according to one source, Ring provided its [redacted]-based research and development team virtually unfettered access to a folder on Amazon’s S3 cloud storage service that contained every video created by every Ring camera around the world.

> At the same time, the source said, Ring unnecessarily provided executives and engineers in the U.S. with highly privileged access to the company’s technical support video portal

I redacted the location of the researches because its irrelevant to the story and plays into prejudices. I also treat the details in news stories with anonymous sources with a dose of skepticism; Ring did provide a statement, but nothing specific. 

I'll reserve judgement on this device specifically, but what's being reported here is utterly believable.

Every time a new smart home device comes out, I think it'd be great. Then I wonder how they'd mess it up maliciously or accidentally. Friends and podcasters discuss how awesome their lives are with their new smart device, and I sit at home using light switches like a schmuck. Then things like this happen. And worst of all, I'm not even happy I'm right each time.

The IoT industry as a whole has not earned your trust. Please consider this before jumping onto the next of these.
