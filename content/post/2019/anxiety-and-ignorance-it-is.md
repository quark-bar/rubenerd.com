I'm reducing the amount of politics I blog about here, in part because it doesn't bring me any joy talking about the latest scandal, or how I think a policy or politician is heading us in the wrong direction. It also ignores the fact that, for the most part, the world is a [better place than it's ever been].

But when... `</rant>`

<p style="font-style:italic;"><strong>Update:</strong> No, you know what? Nuts to a journalist who wants to summarise my entire generation as being ignorant. I don’t want to soil my personal space with his screed, and I don’t want to waste your time reading it. A special shout out and thanks thanks to long-time reader Hales for this insight.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic;">I've redacted the entire rest of this post. It’s likely already archived in a few places if you really want to look, but I wouldn’t bother.</p>
