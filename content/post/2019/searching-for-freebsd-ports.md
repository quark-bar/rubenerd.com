On today's installment of [things you already know unless you don't](https://rubenerd.com/tag/things-you-already-know-unless-you-dont), have a tip from the fine FreeBSD maintainers I noted when booting recently:

> Want to find a specific port, just type the following under `/usr/ports` or one its subdirectories:
>
>	`make search name=<port-name>`   
>    or   
> 	`make search key=<keyword>`

I did not know this!
