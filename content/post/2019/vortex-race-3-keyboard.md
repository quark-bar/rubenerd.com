For reasons that were ~~not entirely~~ my fault, my beloved IBM Model M4 compact keyboard bit the dust late last year. It was smaller, quieter, and arguably less tactile than my Model M, but it was also two-tone beige and matched my computer so well. eBay has more, but they've gone up in price steeply since I bought this a decade ago.

So I'm looking for alternatives, and [Dan Benjamin posted] his handsome [Vortex Race 3]. It has the same two-tone beige colour, but I can get it with Cherry MX Clear switches. They're no Topres, but this board's interface could be used with a USB-PS/2 adaptor, which means I can use my PS/2 to AT adaptor for this vintage machine. Maybe.

It doesn't have chintzy coloured LEDs, and has the all-important insert, delete, home, end, pig up and pig down keys which are important for DOS and other older OSs. A colleague noted the escape key doesn't look standard, but given I'm buying it in part given it's two-tone beige, I doubt I'd be replacing them anytime soon.

I might grab one when we're [back in Akihabara] this year, assuming the Australian Dollar hasn't slipped further in the interim.
