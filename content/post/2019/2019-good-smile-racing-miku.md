Clara and I used to obsessively follow the annual racing incantations of everyone's favourite virtual idol Hatsune Miku, but we've been decidedly lax of late. I feel this is in part the result of Clara not blogging full time anymore; she would have already written an essay length post about each one by now.

I just saw 2019s version drop, and she's the nicest one in a long time. Her pose and expression are super cute, and a bit more unique than the last few years which suffered a bit from *Same Face*. I love her colours especially; she looks even more like a [Bavarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Bavaria) cake with cyan and fuchsia frosting than the original art by [Annindoufu](https://www.goodsmileracing.com/en/racingmiku2019/).

Both of us still think the [2011 version](http://kirinyan.net/racing-miku-2011/) was the best on account of her looking more mature (below left), and I loved the glass shards in her skirt in [ 2013](https://rubenerd.com/2013-gsr-miku/). Her [Toky Taka 2017](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/530085) version was pretty but not necessarily unique, and I wasn't a fan of her weird shirt and colour scheme from [last year](https://myfigurecollection.net/item/600561). I feel this is a return to form; albeit in a completely different style!

Now that I look at her compared to those earlier versions, her design sure has come a long way. I'm still more a fan of the sleek, minimal look of these older ones, but I'm also glad GSR is giving artists a little more freedom now too.
