I haven't done much blogging this week, or even lined up posts to trickle out during the week. In past years we've had a chill start as the masses slowly go back to work, but this year started with earnest. Such a [great story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Importance_of_Being_Earnest).

That hasn't stopped me from having some weirdly specific dreams.

* I had developed a new compression algorithm that lent itself well to streaming chunked data, making rsync a hundred times more efficient. I'd decided to give it to the [OpenRsync](https://www.openrsync.org/) devs first to test on their BSD-licenced version of the tool before getting a call not from Andrew Tridgell and Paul Mackerras, but Al Gore.

* I'd decided that the Ricoh GR III wasn't for me after all, and I got a Canon mirrorless. Then proceeded to feel pangs of guilt and betrayal because I had always been a Nikon SLR guy.

* I was asked to debate a climate denier, but I said they should get a scientist instead. This made me into a meme which started appearing on the sides of buses; unfortunate given I was back in Singapore and those double-deckers have lots of vertical space.

* I replaced all the LEDs in my apartment with a newer generation of LEDs, I think so I could change the colour temperature more easily. But the ceiling started to melt, and I had to collect the falling drops with buckets covered in anime faces.

It's at this stage that I'll admit that this was the *one* dream. Or perhaps it was multiple over the course of the night that blended together.
