Gesundheit. I found an entirely different image while searching for an accompanying Simpsons screenshot on my [Sydney cold snap] post:

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/simpson-msds@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/simpson-msds@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/simpson-msds@2x.jpg 2x" alt="" style="width:250px" /></p>

The caption reads like an Amazon item title:

> Simpson Strong Tie Set Simpson Strong Tie Set Xp Data Sheet Simpson Strong Tie Set Xp Msds

The site was one of those fake blogs that harvest RSS feeds and repost the items as their own. I added a line to each item in my feed a few years ago telling people where posts originally came from. It didn't stop the blatant reposting, but I got some free advertising.

I did a reverse image search and found [Simpson Strong-Tie], which does look legitimate.
