Anime fig collecting is a time-consuming hobby that sucks up your wallet, all your available free space, and is absolutely worth it. So much of our lives sit in digital realms, its nice to have physical anchors in the real world, even in this case it's a cute character from a series or game we love.

*(Admittedly Clara and I have had to pare back our collections since we started living in studio apartments and reducing our amount of stuff, but we still keep an eye open for fun new ones).*

Good Smile Company is one of the better known manufacturers, perhaps most famous for their line of Nendoroids and Good Smile Racing merchandise. Now the evil geniuses are capitalising on the public perception that figs are getting too expensive [with a new fig line]:

> POP UP PARADE is a new series of figures that are easy to collect with affordable prices and releases planned just four months after preorders begin! Each figure stands around 17-18cm in height and the series features a vast selection of characters from popular anime and game series, with many more to be added soon!

Their first one is virtual idol Hatsune Miku, understandable given how iconic she's become over the years. Both this series, and this new fig, present severe challenges to our decluttering and limited living space.
