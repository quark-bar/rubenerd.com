I'm sitting here blogging from our company's cage in the ME1 data centre in Melbourne, as the name of the data centre may suggest. I took a photo outside the facility to send to coworkers, before realising two things:

1. I barely recognised it, because Equinix are building another giant new facility in front, in what used to be a grassy field. Access is through a precariously narrow walkway now.

2. Far more importantly, I couldn't help but realise **the sky is blue**, not an acrid mustard yellow from the weeks of [bushfires](https://rubenerd.com/tag/fires/) that Sydney is blanketed with. Even small storm clouds were a welcome sight.
