I'm not informed of the circumstances; and I know it needs to go through the Senate. But after years of floundering and making a mockery of itself on the world stage, I feel the US took a positive, symbolic step in the right direction. It's been hard to be a defender of America of late, so I'll take what I can get.

But that's not why I'm posting about this. I realised this morning I've been alive for *two* American impeachments. And naturally the people who demanded the office be upheld to certain standards under Mr Clinton are now the ones lining up to defend Mr Orange. It's not hypocricy though, because they don't call it that.

Anyway, I felt it worth posting something about it, given the gravity of the situation.
