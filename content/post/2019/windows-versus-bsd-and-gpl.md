[This Slashdot user] defended the GPL compared to the BSD licence back in 1999:

> Joe Schmoe and Company X are on equal ground with the GPL. Anyone makes a change, everyone gets to see it. No "Embrace and Extend" for Linux and the GNU utils. 
> 
> As for Microsoft BSD, it's quite possible. It's very possible. And they can easily make it incompatible with the other \*BSD's and Linux. And if they get their way wrt the US Universal Product Code, they can even stop people from reverse engineering the results. So they'll be able to build off of the ideas free software developers create without having to share those ideas back. And we'll be back to reinventing the wheel all over again.

Two decades later, and [Windows has Linux].
