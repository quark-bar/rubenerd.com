[TigerVNC] is *by far* my favourite cross-platform VNC client. Others try to shoehorn all these extra features, but TigerVNC presents you with a connection dialog. It's not Retina/HiDPI, but nothing I'm connecting to is anyway.

But it stopped loading starting with macOS 10.14 Mojave. I tried the latest stable and nightly builds on two separate Macs, and both times the icon for the application would bounce once, then quit. Launching from the Terminal worked.

I filed a [bug report], and one of the developers suggested I remove my `~/.vnc` folder. I didn't think to move that folder instead so I could check what was causing the problem.

Anyway, it worked!
