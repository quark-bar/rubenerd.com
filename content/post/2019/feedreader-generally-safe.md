Wanted to keep up to date with *Rubenerd* from a third-party site? <a href="https://feedreader.com/observe/rubenerd.com" rel="nofollow" title="Link to FeedReader... with nofollow directive">FeedReader</a> has you covered! Emphasis added:

> Never miss Rubenerd.com updates: Start reading the news feed of Rubenerd right away! This siteâ€™s **feed is stale or rarely updated** (or it might be broken for a reason) ...

Wait, [what]?

> ... but you may check related news or Rubenerd.com popular pages instead. It is **generally safe** for browsing, so you may click any item to proceed to the site.

*Generally safe* may be the greatest words of praise even given to this blog. But how did I arrive at such a glowing endorsement?

> Child safety: Excellent  
> Trust: Good  
> Privacy: Good  

I pride myself on trust and privacy, but child safety must have come from all the tamper-proof door latches and pubkeys.
