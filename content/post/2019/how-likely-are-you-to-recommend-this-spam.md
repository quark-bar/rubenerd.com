I got another of these increasingly popular feedback emails that ask you to rate a product or experience on an integer scale, this time from a prominent server hardware manufacturer.

These are problematic for many reasons, especially when you spam a page directly with them when you're trying to work. I empathise companies need a lower-friction feedback mechanism that more of their clients will use, but these feedback scales feel like a blunt instrument.

Today I learned another, perhaps far more counterproductive reason they have problems. Companies understandably not only use different scales, they order them differently. Take the example I got this morning:

> *How likely are you to recommend $VENDOR $DEVICE?*  
> **Extremely Likely** 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 **Not Likely** 

And then another one I got last week for a website:

> *How likely are you to use $WEBSITE for new projects?*  
> **Not likely** 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 **Very Likely**

If you weren't paying too close attention and thought you hit the number in the same vague position, you could be saying one company is great, and another sucks! I wonder how many of their metrics are skewed because of this?
