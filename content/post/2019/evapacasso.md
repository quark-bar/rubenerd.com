I tweeted about this inexplicably fabulous new *Evangelion* merchanise, from [Tokyo Otaku Mode](https://otakumode.com/projects/evapacasso):

> Alpacassos, with their fluffy fur and round eyes, have grown quickly, but they’ve gotten even bigger! They’ve fused with NERV’s Multipurpose Humanoid Decisive Weapon, Artificial Human Evangelions, and have become cute artiodactyl decisive weapons (?) called Evapacasso!

[@maidforclass](https://mobile.twitter.com/maidforclass) had the best response:

> Eva can't be used to market everythi... oh, that's a new one.
