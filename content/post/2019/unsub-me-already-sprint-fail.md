Good morning! It's another overcast, dreary morning in Sydney today, which given recent meterological events is nothing short of wonderful. 

Speaking of recurring events&mdash;in the industry we call that a *segue*&mdash;I haven't done a [newsletter unsubscribe](https://rubenerd.com/tag/from-unsub-me-already/) adventure for a while. I got an otherwise-legitimate email from Sprint, the US phone carrier.

**Email:**

> You've earned these perks!

**Footer:**

> UNSUBSCRIBE  |  SPRINT PRIVACY POLICY

**Result:**

> Please indicate below which emails you are no longer interested in receiving by entering your email address, checking one of the boxes, and then clicking 'Submit':
> 
> **[ Email Address ]**
> 
> **☐ Sprint Promotional:** Please do not send me Sprint promotional email communications
> 
> **☐ Opt-in Subscription Emails:** Please do not send me ANY general promotional email communications AND email communications I opted-in to receive

**This is a fail** on my newsletter unsubscribe matrix:

✗ Should not need to enter an email address   
✗ Should not need to confirm in the first place   
✗ Should not need to check multiple checkboxes   
✗ Deliberately confusing language for opt-in checkbox   
✗ Deliberately vague instructions (one box, not two?)

There are few black and white things in this world, but the only correct and acceptable action when clicking *Unsubscribe* in email is *immediately* being unsubscribed. No debate.
