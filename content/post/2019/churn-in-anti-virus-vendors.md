CRN Australia posted these within days of each other:

At least one of those links wasn't on CRN Australia. Try to guess which one, you may be surprised. Or not, because you're a more sensible person than I.

I'm surprised third-party AVs have lasted as long as they have since Microsoft released their Security Essentials. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Sophos though.
