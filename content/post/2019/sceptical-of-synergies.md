Today's spam! Emphasis, much like the seasoning in the food I cooked last night, is added:

> If you are interested **but slightly sceptical** that this is just more junk, let me assure you that it's not. With your permission, I would like to do a video audit on your website for you at no cost and no obligation. This will allow me to show you what we can do and the value that we can provide you in driving your business growth.

And yet I'm still slightly sceptical. Fortunately, here's someone else:

> My team and I are doing some research on data, and are looking for reputable sites with whom we can collaborate. We noticed that your site and $SPAMCOMPANY could **share some synergy** and thus expand both of our audiences.

I love me some shared synergy, but what if I wanted to be a disruptive synergised paradigm?
