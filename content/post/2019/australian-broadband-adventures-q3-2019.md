Australia's mediocre Internet used to come as a surprise to people overseas, but it continues to make headlines for all the wrong reasons. Iain Morris summarised it well for [Broadband World News](http://www.broadbandworldnews.com/author.asp?section_id=473&doc_id=754887&):

> When the NBN idea was originally floated under a previous government, the intention was to extend full-fiber networks to most Australian properties. After a subsequent administration balked at the likely expense, NBN embarked on a rollout using a mixture of access technologies. Just 17% of homes are being covered by fiber, with cable, copper, mobile and satellite networks serving the remainder. It does not sound like the most future-proof system.

I remember a university tutor saying [wireless would solve everything](https://rubenerd.com/australia-nbn/) too. But unsurprisingly, this hodgepodge has now cost *more*, in part because economies of scale couldn't be realised, the existing HFC networks were shockingly not fit for purpose, and because of political lies and spin. [Spending more now](https://rubenerd.com/unprofitable-nbn/) to future-proof the system would have been worth it, but we don't even get that.

This week we got these fun stories:

* Telstra's CEO claimed Australian Internet [would have been faster and cheaper](https://www.itnews.com.au/news/telstra-says-australia-would-have-gotten-100mbps-without-nbn-532374) without the NBN. People won't understand things if their pay cheques depend on them not understanding it, but it was a fun observation nonetheless.

* Rural customers are being told to not expect fibre connections anytime soon, because their [needs are less](#) than those in cities. This from the same minister who said [moving to the bush](https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/property/2017/01/25/barnaby-joyce-housing-affordibility-solution/) was the answer to housing affordability, but that people need to [move back to cities](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/barnaby-joyce-suggests-droughtstricken-farmers-should-consider-leaving-the-land/news-story/c3e6bef23f93e01f677239f8117c79a7/) because of failed drought policy and lack of jobs in part due to poor connectivity.

* NBNco, staffed with the current Government's pricks&mdash;that was supposed to be *picks* but I'm keeping it&mdash;are so fed up with how poorly their network is faring, have [released their own broadband rankings](http://www.broadbandworldnews.com/author.asp?section_id=473&doc_id=754887&) in which we outperform Germany and France. *Problem solved!*

One of those stories was fake. If you live overseas, try to guess which one before clicking any links.
