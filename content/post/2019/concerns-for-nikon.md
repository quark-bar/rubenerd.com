[The Loop linked](http://www.loopinsight.com/2019/08/07/is-this-the-end-of-nikon-as-we-know-it-fiscal-report-shows-71-drop-in-earnings/) to this [worrying story in Digital Camera World](https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/is-this-the-end-of-nikon-as-we-know-it-fiscal-report-shows-71-drop-in-earnings?) about the future of Nikon, specifically their "71% decrease in earnings and an almost 15% drop in revenue". This represents a decrease in unit sales "to less than one-sixth in comparison to fiscal 2012". 

At least part of this can be attributed to developing their new mirrorless cameras, which I'm unreasonably excited to try. I love my Olympus OM-D E-M10 II, but I'm hoping for my next camera to be full frame, and I have a soft spot for Nikon for introducing me to SLR photography in the mid 2000s. Or at least, a soft spot in the parts of the frame that I left out of focus by using a tight aperture.

*(One of my two pancake lenses for the E-M10 recently kicked the bucket, which has me wondering which ecosystem to buy into. With what for money though, given my next major purchase might be a camcorder).*

But it does concern me a little. On the consumer side they're battling increasingly competent mobile phones that pass the [Richard P. Gabriel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better) test, and they're many years behind Sony's runaway success Alpha cameras. Canon also have their new mirrorless range, which I don't know much about.

The irony also isn't lost on me that I wrote an entire post about cameras without a single photo. One day I'll make our Lychee install public, I promise!
