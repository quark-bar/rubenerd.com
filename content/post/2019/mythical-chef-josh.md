I'm so happy the *Good Mythical Morning* staff have given Josh his own videos on their channel. The food and processes he comes up with are brilliant, even if in this case I wouldn't let the end product anywhere near me! He's like a self-deprecating Heston.

This was from his most recent episode where he [mixed a certain energy drink with Gushers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQt8eGchAXs).
