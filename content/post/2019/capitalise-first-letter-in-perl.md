I don't know how I've been a Perl hacker all this time and can never remember this. From [Perldoc](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/ucfirst.html)\:

    my $string = ucfirst $input;

So I don't lose search result juice, this could have also been titled *capitalize first letters in Perl*. Which given Larry Wall is an American, I suppose it should be. Or should I say I've *gotten* used to this *colorful*, *personalized* language. The irony isn't lost on me that I've spent more words and time on this explanation and paragraph than the rest of the post.

I also note that I capitalised the first letter in *Perl*, in advance of rediscovering the use of the aforementioned function. Aside from the letter I, it's also the only word in the previous sentenace that was capitalised. I've spent *Too Much Time&trade;* thinking about this.
