I love when artists, designers, developers, whoever, can take two seeminly unrelated things and make something unexpectedly beautiful with them. Case in point, Suzushiro's theme is Japanese maids with skateboards. They're all fantastic; check them out on [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=3069527) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/suzusiro333/).

But [this one](https://twitter.com/suzusiro333/status/1108753780227477504) made me smile after a long evening. Everything about it is perfect! I don't care if I use [their LINE stickers](https://t.co/4HdxuugWuA) or not, I've just bought both sets as a sign of appreciation and to support awesome art.
