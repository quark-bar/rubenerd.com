[Dean Napolitano writing for the Nikkei Asian Review](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Hong-Kong-protests/Hong-Kong-leader-withdraws-extradition-bill):

> Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Wednesday formally withdrew a controversial extradition bill that has been at the center of massive demonstrations this summer, bowing to one of five demands made by protesters.

And [BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-49573555):

> Tory rebels and opposition MPs have defeated the government in the first stage of their attempt to pass a law designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The Commons voted 328 to 301 to take control of the agenda, meaning they can bring forward a bill seeking to delay the UK's exit date.

I've been watching both these stories closely over the last couple of months, but haven't felt like there was much I could add. I'm still at a loss for words. They're both equal parts scary, surreal.
