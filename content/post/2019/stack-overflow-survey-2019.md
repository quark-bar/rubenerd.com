Stack Overflow are doing their developer survey again. I only wrote down some of my responses, and not which section they appeared in (whoops). I've arranged them into what I think makes sense.


### Multiple choice: development

* Which of the following options best describes you today? *I am not primarily a developer, but I write code sometimes as part of my work.*

* Do you code as a hobby? *Yes.*

* How often do you contribute to open source? *Less than once a month but more than once per year.*

* How do you feel about the quality of open source software (OSS)? *The quality of OSS and closed source software is about the same.*

* What is your favorite music artist or genre that helps you focus? *Michael Franks, and the former Whole Wheat Radio catalogue.*

* What is the worst new dev technology everyone currently uses? *Electron* <span style="color:#296bcc">They didn't ask this, but they should have. –ed</span>


### Multiple choice: work

* What was your main or most important field of study? *Information systems, information technology, or system administration* 

* What are your greatest challenges to productivity as a developer?: *Not enough people for the workload*, and *Non-work commitments.* <span style="color:#296bcc">Though describing life outside of work as a challenge to productivity seems to bely a misunderstanding of life-work balance. –ed</span>

* Where would you prefer to work? *Other place, such as a coworking space or cafe*

* Think back to the last time you updated your resumé, CV, or an online profile on a job site. What is the PRIMARY reason that you did so? *I had a negative experience or interaction at work.*


### Multiple choice: platforms

* What is the primary operating system in which you work? *BSD*.

* How do you use containers (Docker, Open Container Initiative (OCI), etc.)? *Testing*, and *Outside of work, for personal projects.* <span style="color:#296bcc">I wish I could have said FreeBSD Jails; 2018 was a turning point for my use of them. –ed</span>

* How is your organization thinking about or implementing blockchain technology? *Not at all.*

* Blockchain / cryptocurrency technology is primarily: *An irresponsible use of resources.*


### Multiple choice: grab bag

* Do you think people born today will have a better life than their parents? *Yes.* <span style="color:#296bcc">But what a loaded question! This could easily fill dozens of blog posts. –ed</span>

* What individual person do you think will have the most influence in tech in the coming year? *Giovanni Buttarelli.* <span style="color:#296bcc">The EU Privacy Commissioner. –ed</span>

* Are you the "IT support person" for your family? *Also Yes.* <span style="color:#296bcc">You're doing yourself a great disservice if you haven't seen Archer. –ed</span>

* Have you tried turning it off and on again? *Yes.*

* What social media site do you use the most? *LINE.*

* Do you prefer online chat or IRL conversations? *In real life (in person).* <span style="color:#296bcc">Though I prefer neither when I need introvert time. –ed</span>

* What do you call it? *Username*

### StackOverflow feedback

These were text fields.

* Why haven't you ever contributed a Q&A to Stack Overflow? *Corrosive community and "why?" answers, though I've posted on other Stack Exchange sites.*

* If you could change anything about Stack Overflow, what would it be? *Friendlier, less dimissive admins and users, fewer automatically-closed questions.*

* Thank you for taking the survey. Do you have any feedback or thoughts you'd like to share? *Have Perl for languages, and FreeBSD Jails as a container option.*
