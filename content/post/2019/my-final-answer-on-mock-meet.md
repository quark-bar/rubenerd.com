Happy Sunday! How you going? Enjoying your breakfast roll with bacon and egg? Great, more power to you! Some of us are eating a similar roll, but with this great *facon* that this vegetarian company makes.

Unfortunately, this is often perceived as an affront. Or worse, it results in people asking why one would bother. I've [maintained] these deliberately obtuse people have all the facts to know why a vegetarian or pescetarian may eat fake meat, but the question keeps coming up.

So for those who are still puzzled, here are some reasons to choose from. Some people...

* eat what they want to eat;
* don't/can't eat meat, but they can eat mock meat;
* used to eat meat and miss the taste;
* still want to engage in social activities like BBQs;
* use mock meat as a stepping stone to wean off eating meat;
* don't eat real meat over environmental or ethical concerns;
* think mock meat tastes delicious.

There are really only two responses to this. Some mock meat is so heavily processed that it's unhealthy; but there are plenty of healthy ones. And certain Buddhist traditions tolerate mock meat but claim they detract from what they see as a moral life; this stance does not present a moral issue for me.

I hope that clears up any confusion. Further inquiries will result in Merlin Mann's *"yeah, well why am I not a potted fern?"* response.
