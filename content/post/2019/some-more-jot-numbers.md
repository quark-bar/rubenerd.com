I talked about BSD `jot` for generating pseudo-random numbers in a pinch [four years ago](https://rubenerd.com/jot-and-shuf/). To generate a number from 5 to 100, for example:

    $ jot -r 1 5 100

I quoted integers last time. Here are another ten more numbers, using the `-s` argument for defining precision:

    ==> 7.7 18.9 71.7 36.6 52.4 90.9 39.8 29.9 6.2 91.0

Fun fact, two of those numbers contained seven. Refer to my [January post](https://rubenerd.com/it-has-numbers-in-them/) for examples of numbers that don't.

Sometimes I worry my weblog might be *too* useful.
