[Four years ago](https://rubenerd.com/jot-and-shuf/) I talked about BSD `jot` for making pseudo-random numbers in a pinch. To generate a number from 5 to 100, for example:

    $ jot -r 1 5 100

I quoted the following numbers:

    ==> 34 74 86 22 95 14 78 4

Here are another ten more, using the -s flag for a precision:

    ==> 7.7 18.9 71.7 36.6 52.4 90.9 39.8 29.9 6.2 91.0
