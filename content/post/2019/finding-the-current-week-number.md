In our ongoing series of [things you already know, unless you don't], you can get the current week number using the C-style `date(1)` tool in your \*nix of choice:

    $ date +"%U"
    ==> 02

I use week numbers everywhere, especially for task lists. I saw them a lot in Singapore, but I've never seen them used in Australia.
