I just submitted a talk proposal for an upcoming FreeBSD event. I've only taked briefly once during a Work-in-Progress session at AsiaBSDCon, but it was fun walking through ideas and getting feedback, especially from the old guard for whom I harbour tremendous respect.

Michael Dexter of [Call For Testing](https://callfortesting.org) and [bhyvecon](http://bhyvecon.org) fame asked for some examples of IT discouragement a couple of monthso ago. I shared the story of my first attempt of a talk at a Linux conference back when I was in my early 20s, and having people loudly snigger upon hearing I'd written something in Perl. I was thrown off guard, nervous, and didn't finish. It was an embarrasing low point in my career, and took almost a decade to work up the guts to attempt again.

If I'm accepted, I'll let everyone know and will post here :).
