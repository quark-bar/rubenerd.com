I've been overwhelmed and happy by the volume of lovely messages people have sent me about my [hospital adventures](https://rubenerd.com/thanking-medicare-and-rns-staff/) last week. Other people have had far worse and scarier experiences than what I went through, but its good to know that I can be gone for a week and people notice my absence!

Four comments:

* Jim Kloss of the late *[Whole Wheat Radio](https://rubenerd.com/tag/whole-wheat-radio)* fame indicated that snorting those electrolyte ice poles would be ill advised. While I do appear to be performing this act in the photo, I'm relieved to report I was ingesting them orally.

* Hales of [Haelstrom](http://halestrom.net/) joked that the nurses must have noticed my <del>predilection</del> obsession with a certain [mobile game](https://rubenerd.com/tag/fate-grand-order) as the impetus for putting me on an IV. Good thing I've given that a break.

* A classy, anonymous gentleman who may have even figured out how to put on pants this morning said I was blatantly seeking attention, and that I'm no better than an Instagram Influencer.&trade; Good thing I was already in a ward for that *sick burn*, though I wonder how it must hurt holding them to dish out all the time.

* Rebecca commented that I'll do anything to get out of following up on the fitness post I was supposed to have posted months ago. *Touch√©!*
