Clara and I were watching some randomised *Good Mythical Morning* episodes last Friday night, and noticed some [Hetalia](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5060/Hetalia_Axis_Powers) and [Free!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/18507/Free) boys over the shoulder of [this contributor](https://www.youtube.com/?watch=8eraNZHM1to) and their owner.

Anime culture is a global, multi-billion dollar industry, but I still feel like it's an in-thing when I see it in the real world.
