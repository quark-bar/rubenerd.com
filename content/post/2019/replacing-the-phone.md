I'm still on an iPhone 8, and hopefully will be for a long time. Newer or competitor phones, besides their better cameras and batteries that actually hold sufficient charge for a day, don't offer anything more for me than what this one does. And in some ways it's better: it doesn't have a screen inclusion, it has an LCD instead of an OLED, and it's smaller.

This isn't an argument against consumerism; a far better one could be made. For me it's the fact I've **come to resent this device**, and therefore don't want to spend money on it. It demands my attention with notifications, it's a constant source of negative reinforcement, it's a distraction, it's invasive. It's a delivery mechanism for unpalatable things.

For all my arguments about minimalism, decluttering, and Alton Brown multi-toolism, I'm thinking I need to decouple functions from this if I want to return a sense of joy to my day. This will invariably require me to carry more things, but I think I'll be healthier for it.

Here are a few ideas:

* Learning that my day **doesn't need constant distractions** and electronic stimuli in the first place. I'm not there yet.

* My **Kindle for books**, everywhere. I use it to read in bed, but maybe my morning commute would be less stressful if I had a purpose built device that can't have notifications slide over the text I'm reading. Like a real book, only lighter and easier to hold on peak hour trains. 

* A fun, **portable camera** with Wi-Fi that's always with me. The phone is decent, but I need to replace the short dopamine hit of adding to Instagram with longer-term album creation and curation. I've got a few self-hosted ideas for Clara and I to start using which I think could be fun. This is why I'm leaning towards the Ricoh GR III.

* **Desktop computers for websites** and services that have crept into the phone over the years. I don't need to check how my ETFs are performing *this second*, or push notifications for my personal email.

* I used to listen to **podcasts on an old iPod**, but I've become enamoured with being able to download them on the phone as they come out. This might stick on the phone for now.

* My favourite *Fate/Grand Order* **mobile game** is equally tricky, because it needs connectivity and either iOS or Android. I envy people who's favourite games are tied to a Nintendo Switch or something. Maybe it needs its own dedicated iPod Touch or something.

Having collated those, I'm starting to think a better question would be what the phone is essential for, rather than trying to start with everything and peel stuff off.
