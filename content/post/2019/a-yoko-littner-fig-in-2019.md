Interrobangs: a question mark with an exclamation mark, merged together into a single cohesive unit, saving previous horizontal screen real estate and characters. I'm trying to bring them back, having failed many times before. Yes Vim spell checker, they're called *interrobangs*, why aren't you aware of that‽

Speaking of bringing things back and saving characters — how's that for a segue — the evil geniuses at Gainax are releasing a figure of fan favourite Yoko Littner from the twelve-year old science fiction epic *Gurren Lagann*. And she's adorable:

<figure><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/fig-2019yoko@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/fig-2019yoko@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/fig-2019yoko@2x.jpg 2x" alt="" style="width:500px; height:500px;" /></figure>

*Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (天元突破グレンラガン)* was, and is, one of the greatest modern anime series of all time. I use the term *modern* to distinguish it from the 1990s and earlier anime that had a very different feel and tone to them. People watching anime today would already likely consider it old and dismiss it, which would be a crying shame.

[Kamina] and Nia Teppelin were my favourite characters, but Yoko also kicked arse. She was the straight-shooting muscle, but also had a caring side that leant Simon strength after a certain event. I [blogged about it] back in 2011.

She's sculpted by ATOMIC-BOM SUZU to resemble the cover page of Yoko's photo collection book, according to her [AmiAmi description]. I think they're referring to this:

<figure><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/fig-2019yoko-art@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/fig-2019yoko-art@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/fig-2019yoko-art@2x.jpg 2x" alt="" style="width:420px; height:550px;" /></figure>

If I had any criticism, it's that its not Nia Teppelin instead (cough), and that she looks more mature in her art. I know cute sells, but I'd be keen seeing more grown up versions of characters from older series as well. *Gurren Lagann* would be a prime candidate for this given the series' second arc.

She's available for pre-order now, and will be shipped in June 2019. If only my studio apartment shelves could accommodate. Sorry Yoko, but my Japanese NCC-1701-D took up that last bit of space.
