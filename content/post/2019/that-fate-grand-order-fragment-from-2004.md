I've been taking time during this travelling to write, explore, and perhaps catch up on *Fate/Grand Order*. I'm stoked to have Tohsaka Rin's nostalgic uniform as a Mystic Code for many reasons, not least because I think I look rather fetching:

<figure><p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/screenie-fgo-2004frag-me@1x.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing my Master wearing Tohsaka Rin's uniform as a mystic code." srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/screenie-fgo-2004frag-me@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/screenie-fgo-2004frag-me@2x.jpg 2x" /></p></figure>

Yes I play as the female master, as previously mentioned. It still throws me sometimes when I read the story dialogue and I'm referred to as *she* and *her*. But I'll take any compliments in my <del>clearly brilliant</del> abilities in any form they so wish to express. 

Perhaps the biggest surprise from the most recent event was seeing Medusa wearing the uniform as a plot device. I appreciate they pay homage to the earlier *Fate* installments for their old school fans.

I feel that dialogue could describe 2019 so far.
