Australian Opposition Leader Bill Shorten delivered his budget reply speech last night. I cried when he announced his plans for sweeping additions to Medicare for cancer screening and treatments. We were extraordinarily fortunate that my dad had a great job and insurance; it meant my sister and I had a mum for another decade. **Everyone** should have that opportunity.

I won't lie, I was feeling excellent afterwards. The current government's budget speech was a shrill diatribe against a party that hasn't been in government for six years. Bill Shorten sounded like he had a plan, and his shadow cabinet looked more prepared than the government's own bench.

But with a day to mull it over in my head, and thinking about my own industry, a few bits of reality set in. This is the same opposition party that sided with the government on the [#aabill], and the arguably well-intentioned but disastrous [social media reform law], both of which are costing Australian IT jobs and our international reputation.
 
As [Simon Sharwood wrote for CRN], Mr Shorten was also scant on details:

> Innovation wasn’t mentioned in the speech, and technology scored but a fleeting mention in remarks about “new investments in eliminating mobile blackspots; and a more reliable NBN for small business”. No detail was offered in either case.

To expect Bill to cover the aforementioned legislation may have been a stretch, but with the election looming it was Labor's *de facto* campaign start. And dare we forget that while they started the NBN, it was that same Labor politician who wanted to instigate the [Great Firewall of Australia].

There's potentially a lot to be optimistic about in a few months, but I fear IT and digital rights won't be among them.
