Clara and I booked a hotel for the Singapore arm of our recent trip through a well-known travel site. These were the emails I got, in chronological order:

* Confirmation for Booking ID `$NUMBER`
* Confirmation for Booking ID `$NUMBER`
* Would you recommend `$HOTEL` to a friend?
* Would you recommend `$HOTEL` to a friend?
* Would you recommend `$HOTEL` to a friend?
* Your stay at `$HOTEL`
* Would you recommend `$HOTEL` to a friend? *[ed: chill, people!]*
* Reminder: Reminder - Your stay at `$HOTEL`

I've since been opted in to a bunch more stuff from this travel site. Why would I want junk mail about other places I could stay in a city I just left?

Contrast with the email I got from booking a hotel in Kuala Lumpur directly:

* Reservation Confirmed
* Thank You !
