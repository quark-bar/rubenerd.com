It's [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday/) time, that time of the week where I discuss music. It's an interrupted series of posts that's only been interrupted for years at a time.

Today's song comes from... nothing. I left my Lightning&trade; adaptor at home today, so I wandered to work without any music or podcasts of any sort. I was almost bored to tears for much of the train ride into work, but by the time I was walking through the [Domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Domain%2C_Sydney), I'd come to enjoy the sound of the outside world.

I often talk about how I resent my phone, and that I still suffer from more anxiety than I should. Perhaps being more in tune with my surroundings would do me more good than I thought.
