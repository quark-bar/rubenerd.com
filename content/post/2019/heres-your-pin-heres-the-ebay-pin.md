eBay can be set up to send you a PIN confirmation email each time you log into a new device it doesn't recognise. It's not foolproof, and arguably we have far better systems for multi-factor auth, but it's a start.

This is what eBay sends:

> **Subject: Here's the eBay PIN you requested**
> 
> Confirm your identity: Here's your PIN
> 
> Here's the eBay PIN you requested
>
> Hi rubenerd,
> 
> Here is the PIN you'll need to finish confirming your identity on eBay. 
> It's just one more step, and then you'll be on your way.
> 
> Your PIN is: HERES-YOUR-PIN [ed: okay, I made that up]

My favourite was them saying it's just one more step, as if reassuring me after saying I'd be getting a PIN *four times*. Then *another* time. But are they sure I'm getting a PIN?
