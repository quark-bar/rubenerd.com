I've been writing this blog since late 2004, so I thought it'd be fun to see what I was writing [a decade ago] to the day. Today's entry regarded the [site appearing on blogged.com]\:

> While checking my server records I noticed I was getting a few hits from [Blogged.com]. It seems they [added my blog to their database] and filed me under "miscellaneous" and "management". Funny how my blog has as much to do with management as an *echidna* would have to do with a *large shoehorn*, but there you go. The miscellaneous tag I'm not disputing, but then again wouldn't every self respecting blogger have more than a few miscellaneous posts in their blog that were off the primary topic?

The links are dead, because of course they are. But the ever-brilliant Wayback Machine [had a copy]. Under *featured posts* they also mentioned:

* [An Internet Explorer Twiter ribbon thing](https://rubenerd.com/ie6mustdie-twibbon)
* [Celebrating a fortuitous 1,888 posts](https://rubenerd.com/1888-posts)
* [Saying goodbye to the urlTea shortener](https://rubenerd.com/goodbye-urltea)
* [A Twitter outage](https://rubenerd.com/2009-06-08-twitter-fail/)
* [My review of the third *Bakemonogatari* episode](https://rubenerd.com/anime-bakemonogatari-03)

Wait, *Bakemonogatari* was a decade ago? That's mortifying.

<em><strong>Update:</strong> I realised this was a year and a day ago, not a year ago. Close enough.</em>
