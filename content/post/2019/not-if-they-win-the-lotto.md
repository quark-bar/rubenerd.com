I was sitting with my awesome AsiaBSDCon Ahihabara Panasonic FreeBSD laptop at this cafe, like a gentleman, and a couple were walking out.

> **Barista:** Have a great day, see you again!   
> **Customer:** Not if we we win the lotto, you won't!

They were obviously saying in jest, but it made me think. *In jest* sounds like *ingest*, which souds like *indigestion*, which reminds me why I think *gastronomy* is such an unfortunately-titled field of study. Also, that they would think they wouldn't visit this great little café if they won the lottery.

I can tell you now, winning the lottery would give me a reason to spend *more* of my days at cafés. My dream would be to win a pile of money, live off interest and dividends, and spend my days contributing to open source projects and writing. And paying for a coffee with fifties and letting them keep the change!

Private yachts, jets, and other trappings of wealth sound like they'd be a huge pain in the arse to maintain. I suppose if one were wealthy enough they could hire someone to do that, but then you have a person to keep tabs on as well. My only indungence would be homes in places I care about, like Sydney and Singapore; which naturally are two of the world's most expensive housing markets.
