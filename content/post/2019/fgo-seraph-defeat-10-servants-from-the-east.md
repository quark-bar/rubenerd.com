For those of your eleventh-houring the *[Fate/Extra CCC SE.RA.PH](https://grandorder.wiki/Main_Page "My favourite Fate/Grand Order fan wiki")* event in the English *[Fate/Grand Order](https://fatego.us/ "Official website")*, you may have been as confused as me as to the description of this Mission Reward:

> Defeat 10 servants from the East

I was doing quests along the eastern arm on both sides, but not getting anywhere. Not to get all B.B. on you, but *turns out*, they're referring to *East* as in *East Asian*. So you're looking for [servants like this](https://grandorder.gamepress.gg/seraph-enemy-locator#Servant_Oriental "GamePress Guide: Oriental Servants").

I don't like following guides; I think they detract from the sponteneousity and fun of the game. But perhaps I should cheat a little sometimes to save confusion.
