Speaking of [retrospectives](https://rubenerd.com/thinkpad-x40-an-all-time-favourite/) on posts from exactly a decade ago, [back in 2009](https://rubenerd.com/anime-mio-ducati/) I shared this fanart of *K-On!* character Akiyama Mio riding a motorbike. All I could find of the original artist was a [link from Zerochan](https://www.zerochan.net/Pixiv+Id+198353) to their [Pixiv page](https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=198353), which is no longer active.

It got me thinking which other characters I knew that rode bikes or scooters. In light of the recent [Kyoani tragedy](https://rubenerd.com/love-for-kyoto-animation/) I feel it's incumbent upon me to point out my another personal favourite from a series they animated: Fujibayashi Kyou from the 2007 anime adaptation of *Clannad*. Here was a key visual that showed their penchant for gorgeous landscapes:

Fast forward a decade, and we had Shima Rin from *Yurucamp* last year, another slice-of-life series I thoroughly enjoyed.

But I'd still say the winner is *Gintama!* One day I'll finish all nine million episodes, I promise.

(Damn it, I just remembered *FLCL* as well).
