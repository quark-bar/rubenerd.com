Yesterday I made a [pointless observation] that was news to me. Most clocks and watches with Roman numerals employ *IIII* instead of *Ⅳ* for the number 4. Here's an example on one of my favourite Seiko watches:

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/se094@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/se094@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/se094@2x.jpg 2x" alt="" style="width:320px" /></p>

Ivars Peterson had a [great blog post] about it:

> There are many stories about why IIII appears so often as a replacement for IV on clocks but no definitive explanation. The tradition apparently has a long history and may even go back to sundials. [...] I tend to like the explanations that appeal to symmetry.

Naturally it attracted a comment like this, with a delightful punctuation mistake presumably bourne of the same ignorance for which he espouses contempt:

> Peoples [sic] ignorance astounds me.

Here are some more interesting factoids:

* The Unicode [number forms block] has a character for *Ⅳ*, but not *IIII*.

* Apple never released a follow-up to the *III*, but I imagine it would have stirred quite the debate as to how to name it given Steve's penchant for typography.

* *IIII* looks more like a barcode than the word itself does, or *Ⅳ* for that matter.
