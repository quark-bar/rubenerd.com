Josh Taylor wrote a [great article](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/24/dont-choose-national-security-over-human-rights-and-privacy-information-commissioner-warns) on some advice I'm sure home affairs minister Peter Dutton will ignore:

> Victorian [state] information commissioner, Sven Bluemmel ... told the digital citizens conference at the University of Melbourne on Wednesday that in his role, in having a responsibility for privacy and information security in Victoria, he tried to reinforce the idea with senior policymakers that they do not need to be making a choice between security and human rights or privacy ... “It’s a false dichotomy,” he said.

My American friends would refer us to Thomas Jefferson's famous quote about those sacrificing liberty for security.

Then again, Australia's former conservative prime minister John Howard also said Victoria was Australia's Massachusetts, which I *think* he meant as an insult, but I'd be proud to hang on my wall. They're about the only state in Australia run by halfway competent people at this stage, and I say that as someone in NSW.
