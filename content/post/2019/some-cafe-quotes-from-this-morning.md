Have some things I've heard in the last five minutes, as I sit here beveraging this coffee. I'm making *beverage* a verb, try and stop me.

* I don't have cash, I'm a millenial!
* Not the lanky one, the odd one.
* ... it’s the same drink except for all *that* stuff.
* Don't you have anything carbonated?
