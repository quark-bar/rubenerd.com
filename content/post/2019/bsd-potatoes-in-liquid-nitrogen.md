Merry Christmas eve! Clara and I were watching videos this evening, and somehow we ran into a streak of comparitive videos.

Here the *Good Mythical Morning* guys comparing [microwaved and oven-cooked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1qjjr2V-7g) food. Their reactions mirror mine; microwaved potatoes are fluffy and beautiful, but most dishes taste better finished or cooked entirely in the oven.

Here Cody from *Cody's Lab* [compares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idMkzmXAgeI) the ductility, malleability, and brittleness of various metals while supercooled with liquid nitrogen. He retried aluminium in another video and found it performed much better than the thin solder he had before, but copper performed the best.

And finally, George Neville-Neil [explains his pragmatic reasons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cofKxtIO3Is) for preferring BSD licences over the GPL and other copyleft licences on this episode of *The Lunduke Hour*. I've mentioned this video a few times here, but I realised I never shared it. It was interesting and a lot of fun.
