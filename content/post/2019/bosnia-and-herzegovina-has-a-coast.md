I **love** discoveries like this! I thought Bosnia and Herzegovina became landlocked after Crotia split from Yugoslavia, but [according to Wikipedia]\:

> Bosnia and Herzegovina is an almost landlocked country â€“ it has a narrow coast at the Adriatic Sea, about 20 kilometres (12 miles) long surrounding the town of Neum.

Here's a map of [Bosnia and Herzegovina] from OpenStreetMap, with Croatia to the left alongside the Adriatic Sea:

And here's the lower part of the country, with its [coast centred on Neum]:
