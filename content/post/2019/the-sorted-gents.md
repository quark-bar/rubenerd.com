If you don't watch Sorted Food, you're missing out on five adorable British gentleman cook. And two of them are even chefs! Clara and I love their Pass It On episodes, where they must all prepare a meal together, but one at a time with the others blindfolded. [Today's was dessert].

Their videos always include the gentleman's name in the corner in these turn-based games, which for your convenience and my entertainment I've finally collated to satisfy my need to collect things. I always thought James' bemused expression was the best, which contrasts well with how he felt at the end of the challenge!
