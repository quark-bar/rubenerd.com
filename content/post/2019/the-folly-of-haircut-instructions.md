John Roderick talked about something I know all too well on the [latest Road Work] with Dan Benjamin, emphasis added:

> I said I’m trying to grow this out, **would you leave the front long**, because it takes longer to grow the front out, so will you just cut the back? And the guy said “absolutely, I know exactly what you want.”
> 
> So he was chatting along, and he cut the back, and it looked good. He got to the end, chat chat chat, cut cut cut. And the last thing he did was **comb my bangs straight down and cut them off across the front**.
> 
> He was absentminded or this was *just* a hair cut. I said “ah dude, I’ve been growing these bangs out for a long time!”

This happened to me *constantly*. I like having a fringe, or *bangs* as my American friends would say. As far as I know this is one of our only language differences where the Commonwealth word is singular, but the American alternative is plural. That's fascinating.

Anyway my fringe would *always* get cut off despite asking otherwise. For those of us with less hair than we’d like, this is doubly a struggle! I was lucky I found a hair dresser in Chatswood now that respects my wishes.
