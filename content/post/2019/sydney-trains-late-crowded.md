Matt Oâ€™Sullivan [wrote this for the Sydney Morning Herald] this morning, having received material from a state government freedom of information request:

> Peak-hour delays due to Sydney Trains' fleet surged by 41 per cent in the six months to June, compared with the same period a year earlier.

I can believe it. While he attributed the issues to reliance on older rail stock, that number popped up again in [an article he wrote in 2017]\:

> Some 41 per cent of trains passing through Central Station during the morning rush hour in March were overcrowded, compared with 25 per cent six months earlier.
>
> Passengers begin to suffer from overcrowding when trains have loads of 135 per cent, which is the benchmark used by transport officials.

This is what underinvestment looks like.
