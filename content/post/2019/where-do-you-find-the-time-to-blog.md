A common question I'm asked is *why do you overuse passive voice?* The second is in the title. Blogging fills two purposes for me:

* It's an idea dump. I understand and think through concepts and problems easier if I have to explain them, and text is the easiest way I can.

* It's a cathartic hobby. I enjoy sitting at caf√©s and writing; either this, technical documentation, or fiction that may (not) ever see the light.

So it's not a question of finding time, it's how I'd function if I didn't.

*(I mostly write posts within minutes, so it's also not especially time consuming. I may also cheat and write a series of posts which are published over a week if I know I'll be especially busy at work. But you didn't read any of that).*
