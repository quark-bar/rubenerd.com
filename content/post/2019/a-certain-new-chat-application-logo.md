A certain chat application changed their logo to include a [negative space swastika], with an understandably *mixed* reaction from the public.

Some employ the *ignorance is bliss* defence by claiming they can't see it. Others that spiritual practices have used the symbol for thousands of years, obtusely ignoring the fact this logo was designed in 2019 with full knowledge of what it means to most of their clients.

I'm not even Internet Outraged, I'm just surprised an entire team of talented designers could have overlooked it. It's *London 2012* all over again.
