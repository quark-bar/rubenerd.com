In the space of one day I read at least ten people complaining that those complaining about [Slack's new swastika] were not complaining about important issues. Either it was all biting satire, or they couldn't apply the same logic to themselves. 

I reckon 90% of the hot takes I read online fall into this category of self-redundancy. If that isn't a term, I'm coining it now!
