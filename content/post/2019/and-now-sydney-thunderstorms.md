On [Tuesday](https://rubenerd.com/a-smoky-sydney-morning/) the dry bushfire smoke in Sydney was bad, and [yesterday](https://rubenerd.com/another-smoky-sydney-morning/) managed to get even worse.

Then this evening, we had a *thunderstorm*. It was a beautiful [walk in the rain](https://rubenerd.com/music-monday-walk-in-the-rain/) after choking dry heat and smoke all week.
