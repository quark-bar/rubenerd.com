Looks good! [From the new site](https://freebsd.kde.org/):

> The KDE/FreeBSD team hopes this site will be a valuable resource for all who are interested in maintaining the high level of compatibility between FreeBSD and KDE Software (KDE Frameworks 5, KDE Plasma and Applications and Extragear) that has been seen to date. The goal is to facilitate the discussion of patches, finding bugs, suggesting features and hopefully becoming a valuable member of both the KDE and FreeBSD communities. 

KDE was the [first desktop I tried on FreeBSD](https://rubenerd.com/haruhi-suzumiya-on-freebsd/) back in 2007, and while I use Xfce on mobile, its my favourite fully-featured environment to use on my beefy desktop at home. I'm glad to see the project is still going well.
