Tohsaka Rin and Saber are a delightfully-festive mobile home screen; something we all need down here. I'd been tossing up between using this from *[Unlimited Blade Works](https://rubenerd.com/fate-stay-night-unlimited-blade-works/)*, or one of the ones from the original Fate/Stay Night. Or even something from *Fate/Grand Order*, but Clara and I have already done that for a few years now.

I love that this has become such an enduring franchise. Few things survive from my childhood, but it's still fun seeing their beaming faces after all these years. My only regret is not snapping this at 22:22 on the 22nd.
