Remember these delightful suppositories of wisdom from our former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull?

* All Australians understand that high-quality, reliable and affordable broadband is a critical part of the infrastructure our nation needs to prosper in coming years.

* The coalition NBN will be sooner, cheaper, and more affordable.

* A vote for One Nation is a vote for Labor.

* If you try to come to Australia by boat, even if we think you are the best person in the world, even if you are a Nobel Prize winning genius, we will not let you in.

* The laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia.

But this is the one I'm sure he wrestles with the most now:

* I don't find myself in moral turmoil. I'm not given to turmoil of any kind.

I'd list our current PM's gaffes over the last few months, but I want this post to be finished before I turn 60. Bring on the election.
