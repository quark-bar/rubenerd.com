My Singapore nostalgia is likely to become *insufferable* over the coming days, for which I acknowledge but shamelessly do not apologise for. Maybe I should preface such posts with SG19, as the government here is [want to do](https://www.sg/SG50 "Singapore 50") with anniversaries and such.

Yesterday Clara and I wandered over to Junction 8 in Bishan, five stops along the North-South MRT line from Orchard. Between high school and university I worked briefly in the area as a Perl developer, because that's what we did in the mid 2000s! The company's offices were in the Union Industrial Building, a few blocks down the street.

I figured it must have been refurbished, because all I could find online of the original building was an outdated listing on [EdgeProp](https://www.edgeprop.sg/project/non-residential/union-industrial-building-13621), and an entry on [PropertyGuru](https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/project/clarus-centre-20409) under an interim name, the *Claris Centre*. Fortunately, the latter had the photo above.

Needless to say, is a superfluous phrase. The area around the building was almost unrecognisable; all the low-rise light industrial buildings and offices had made way for tall glass buildings, including the Union Industrial Building. There's even a new Circle Line station *literally* across the street.

I took photos of the entire building from the front, but somehow the setting sun between these two new structures seemed more apt.
