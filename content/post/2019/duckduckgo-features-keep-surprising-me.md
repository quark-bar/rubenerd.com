The world's greatest search engine isn't just great for privacy, it has a ton of hidden, fun features. [!Bang shortcuts](https://duckduckgo.com/bang "Introduction to DuckDuckGo Bangs") are how I basically get everywhere online now.

Here are some more I learned of today:

* Search [json prettify](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=json+prettify), and you get a JSON Beautifier and Validator. You can even choose your indentation spacing.

* Search [colour picker](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=colour+picker), and you get what it says. You can choose [analogous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogous_colors "Wikipedia article on analogous colours"), [triadic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_scheme#Triadic "Wikipedia article section on triadic colour schemes"), and [tetradic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_scheme#Tetradic "Wikipedia article section on tetradic colour schemes").

Here's some beautified, validated JSON with a random triad colour scheme:

    {
        "colour0": "7bfcb5",
        "colour1": "b57bfc",
        "colour2": "fcb57b"
    }
