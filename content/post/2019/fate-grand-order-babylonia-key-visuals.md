I haven't had the change to check out the latest *Fate/Grand Order Absolute Demonic Front: Babylonia* anime adaptation episodes with Clara yet, but the key visuals look pretty great. I love that they asked the fans which story from the mobile game they wanted animated... and that it was Babylonia!

I say this each time, but *FGO* is still the only mobile game I've ever been able to play and absorb myself in; equal parts visual novel and strategy card game with admittedly some grindy gatcha. It was based on a long-established franchise that I loved. And now its spawned TV shows and movies. Type-Moon have come a long way.
