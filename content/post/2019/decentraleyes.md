This is one of my new favourite plugins for Firefox I found this morning. As in, I found it this morning, not that it's one of my favourites that I found this morning, implying that I found many plugins this morning when I only found this one this morning, and its my favourite. Clear as mud.

[Decentraleyes] locally caches content that's routinely hosted on third party CDNs and other "free" services. The developer Thomas Rientjes puts free in quotes, given you're still paying with your privacy and data.

I stopped using NoScript a couple of years ago when the Internet reached a tipping point, and browsing without JavaScript became all but impossible. Blocking trackers with uBlock Origin partly solves this, but it's still leaky.

Decentraleyes intercepts:

> Google Hosted Libraries, Microsoft Ajax CDN, CDNJS (Cloudflare), jQuery CDN (MaxCDN), jsDelivr (MaxCDN), Yandex CDN, Baidu CDN, Sina Public Resources, and UpYun Libraries.

And hosts the following resources:

> AngularJS, Backbone.js, Dojo, Ember.js, Ext Core, jQuery, jQuery UI, Modernizr, MooTools, Prototype, Scriptaculous, SWFObject, Underscore.js, and Web Font Loader.

I don't host any third party content, partly because I'm a human. My own site doesn't either, but I've resigned myself to the fact that just makes me an old-fogey in 2019. For the rest of the web, we now have this plugin.
