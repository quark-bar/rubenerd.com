> To the Tumblr refugees: welcome!
> 
> Having been on the Internet for over thirty years, I have one piece of advice for creative folks working online:

> Control Your Platform.
> 
> Don't build a business around Facebook, Tumbler, G+, Geocities, MySpace, AltaVista, or any of these other third parties that claim to offer quick and easy results.
