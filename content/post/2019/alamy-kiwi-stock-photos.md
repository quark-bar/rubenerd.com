This [Alamy stock photo] is captioned "group of people holding Australian flag". It's an all too common source of confusion, and understandable given our British Blue Ensign [derivatives] are so similar and dull. Here's [Australia's ugly flag] for those unfamiliar.

[Canada] and the [United States] changed theirs, can we get new ones please?
