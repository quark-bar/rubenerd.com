My train commute time from Chatswood to Sydney Central is hauntingly well-timed for an anime episode. I prefer watching my favourites with Clara at home on the big screen, so I've decided to watch shows I otherwise would have glossed over during this time, and review them here under the auspices of *Anime Commute Reviews*. That name was dreamed up during one of those exhausted commutes, hence it's thoroughly uninspired title.

The first to get the smartphone treatment is cult classic *ReZero: Starting Life in Another World*. Saying people were obsessed with this series would be an understatement, and lacking precision. People were obsessed with Rem, the blue-haired maid. When Clara and I were in Osaka in 2017, then Tokyo a year later, most anime stores had entire shrines devoted to selling her merchandise.

I'm only three episodes in so far, but — no real spoilers — its the *Endless Eight* in a vaguely medieval setting, as anime is oft to be these days. The battle scenes and taunting in the first double episode were boring to the point of mind-numbing, and I was already beginning to lose interest by the third repeat. But its certainly darker than any of the moe moe merchanise of cute blue haired girls would have you think at first glance.

It's... growing on me. I love that it has a degree of self-awareness as expressed through Subaru blurting out that he was waiting for his *bishoujo*. Who of course appeared, and was beautiful.

If the timeskips are the recurring theme of this series, it may lend itself well to sleepy early morning commutes; no need to re-watch stuff I missed if it repeats.
