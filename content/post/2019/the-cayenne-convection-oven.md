I was searching for a NetBSD-specific package, but somehow ended up on an *entirely* unrelated page for the [Cayenne Convection Oven, Half Size](https://vollrath.com/Products/Countertop-Equipment/Cooking-Equipment/Cayenne-Convection-Ovens/40703):

> Vollrath Convection Ovens offer the perfect opportunity for operations to break into the fresh-baked market or expand existing menus. Ideally suited for dough products, pastries, and cakes- use with pre-made frozen products to achieve fresh-baked sales with high speed and minimal fuss.

The manufacturer is quick to warn though:

> Due to the unique efficiency of Convection Ovens, traditional recipe times and/or temperatures must be adjusted to achieve the best results. When considering a traditional oven recipe, you should generally either lower the temperature by about 25° F, or lower the baking time by approximately 25%.

I'm not sure what 25° furlongs are in metres, but I'm sure it runs on a [single tank](https://twitter.com/SimpsonsQOTD/status/827906081628250113) of kerosene. Here's a picture with some of the aforementioned baked goods; it looks delightful.
