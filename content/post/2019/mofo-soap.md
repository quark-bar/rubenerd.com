For some reason it's easier for me to use or dispose of stuff during [bouts of decluttering](https://rubenerd.com/goodbye-junk/) if I write about it first. Perhaps in my mind, by putting it on my blog, it'll keep living on in some awkward, nerdy way.

I was doing a junk clean up this weekend, like a gentleman. Among a pile of stuff that's remained untouched for years, I had completely forgot about a small box of memories from my 18th birthday that already seems far too long ago to be comfortable. And one of the items? A [BlueQ](https://www.blueq.com/) bar of *Mofo Soap!*

> Nothin' keeps that Mofo clean like Mofo Soap. If you're a bad-ass Mofo, and you know you are, there is no other soap. For full effect, get your entire bad-ass self covered in Mofo suds, check yo' self in the full-size bath mirror, and rinse.

Obviously bought tongue in cheek, but it brought a smile to my face after more than a decade. As opposed to a smile somewhere else, which sounds anatomically dubious.

The bar of bergamot, lemon, and amber scented soap is pictured above next to my second Cussons Prize Medal Oatmeal soap for which I currently harbour an obsession, to give you a sense for what a big-ass mofo sized soap this is. And Saber, to represent the fact I'm still a weeb even after all this time. She's a bad-ass.

My evening shower is going to be awesome.
