Elon Musk [tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1198344195317985280) that Tesla have had 140,000 orders for the *Cybertruck*, and without any money spent on advertising. I have to hand it to Twitter; my entire timeline was exploding earlier this week about:

* how awful the new truck looks
* how the demo had failed
* memes, doctored screenshots, and more memes
* <del>commentary that should be on a blog post</del> threads

I didn't know the demo had happened, or what a *Cybertruck* was till I saw these. Why *would* you waste money on advertising when your detractors are so willing to discuss it ad nauseum?
