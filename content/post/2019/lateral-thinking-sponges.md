I like to engage in lateral thinking exercises when I need inspiration. Lateral thinking is defined by Apple's Dictionary.app as:

> Phonetics (of a consonant, especially the English clear l) pronounced with partial closure of the air passage by the tongue, which is so placed as to allow the breath to flow on one or both sides of the point of contact.

Today's lateral thinking exercise is: *name as many reasons you can for using a sponge.* Here we go:

* As a sponge. ðŸ§½

Damn it.
