Our office just moved to Woolloomooloo, one of the more delightfully named waterfront suburbs of Sydney. So my first task was to find a new coffee shop to adopt as my second desk. And I think I've found it :)

I love this area. Being just out of the CBD means more of the light hits the street, rather than being blocked by buildings. It makes everything feel so much more airy and bright. Our new office space is equally breezy and open, which is a pleasant change from the semi-corporate cubicle farm we were in before.

It also hasn't escaped me that almost every other post on the homepage has inadvertently discussed coffee this week. It'd be *disgust* coffee if you didn't like it, which I originally read as *degausse*. Mmm, coffee ray tubes.
