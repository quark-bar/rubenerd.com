[Music Monday] time. Each and every Monday, except when I forget and **blatently** post on a Tuesday, I post a song I find delightful or otherwise thought-provoking, in the hopes it will delightfully provoke you. At least part of that sentence came out wrong.

From [Darwin Derby] by Vulfpeck:

> Of all the creatures in the sea, my favorite is the bass  
> It climbs up all the rocks and trees  
> And slides down on its hands and knees  
> But why does the shark have teeth?  
> The shark has teeth to eat, I see  
> And why does the whale have feet?  
> Well it... I don't know

This song is *criminally* funky.
