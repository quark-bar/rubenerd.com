[XioNYC's tweet](https://twitter.com/XioNYC/status/1125937631576166401), with appropriate news links added:

> 1980s: MS-DOS or PC-DOS   
> 2020s: [Microsoft Linux](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/shipping-a-linux-kernel-with-windows/) or [IBM Linux](https://rubenerd.com/ibm-agrees-to-buy-red-hat/)

The only nitpick I had: <nowrap>PC DOS</nowrap> didn't have a hyphen. It's a common mistake given MS-DOS did have one. Perhaps that's why FreeDOS eschew (gesundheit) the space entirely.
