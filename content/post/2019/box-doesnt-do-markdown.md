I attempted to preview a `test.markdown` file in Box:

> We're sorry, this file type is not currently supported.

I've come to just expect inline Markdown support in everything these days; it's a surprise when a service doesn't do it. NextCloud and Dropbox both do, along with login forms that [don't do this].
