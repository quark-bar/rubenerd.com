It's the time of year where we can reference *The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya*, that [legendary series](https://rubenerd.com/tag/suzumiya-haruhi) animated by our beloved *KyoAni* back in 2010. I can't believe it'll already be a decade ago next year.

Five years later, and I would be going to anime event dressed as Kyon, with Clara cosplaying as Yuki :').
