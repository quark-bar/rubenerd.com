We haven't had a [Wikimedia Commons bird](https://rubenerd.com/tag/birds/) in a while. Yesterday Wikipedia featured this handsome speciman by Charles J. Sharp.

From its [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_roller)\:

> The Indian roller (Coracias benghalensis) is a bird of the family Coraciidae, the rollers. It occurs widely from West Asia to the Indian Subcontinent. It is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.
> 
> It is best known for its aerobatic displays of males during the breeding season. It is often seen perched along roadside trees and wires and are commonly seen in open grassland and scrub forest habitats. The largest population occurs in India, and several states in India have chosen it as their state bird.

The bird is the word.
