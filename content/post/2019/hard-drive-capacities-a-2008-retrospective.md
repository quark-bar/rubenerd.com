I wrote about [buying a 320 GB drive](https://rubenerd.com/p3048/ "Western Digital Scorpio Black 298GiB goodness") back in 2008. Here's a random snippet:

> I wonder what the capacity of the drive I buy in 2009 will be? Will they have 30TB drives by then you reckon?

This was a typo, I meant to say 2019. Hey, *that's now!*

We don't have commercially available 30 TB drives today, but 10 to 12 TB drives are common. The bigger shift since then has been to SSDs, which now eclipse that 7200 RPM drive I bought back then.
