Apple announced their new line of MacBook Pros in the 13 and 15-inch sizes. No word of the [mythical 16-inch](https://rubenerd.com/apples-rumoured-16-inch-macbook-pro/ "Apple’s rumoured 16-inch MacBook Pro") the rumour mills were obsessed with a few short months ago.

Let's address the concerns first. Their press release made no mention of the keyboard; an odd and elephant-in-room sized omission given the press coverage has even spilled over to mainstream publications now. The imitable Jim Dalrymple [got a comment from Apple](http://www.loopinsight.com/2019/05/21/apple-releases-macbook-pro-8-core-fixes-keyboard/), emphasis added:

> To address the problem, Apple said they **changed the material** in the keyboard’s butterfly mechanism that should substantially reduce issues that some users have seen.

This isn't the redesign people with keyboard issues were asking for. The user-hostile bufferfly mechanism has fundamental durability and ergonomic issues inherient in its design. Warranty programmes address the symptoms but not the cause; they just need to be replaced. And nobody has delivered a compelling use for the touchbar, not even Apple.

I'm also unsure how useful a new 8-core CPU will be to a computer with a chassis that can't thermally handle its current ones. I used my [first-generation MacBook Pro](https://rubenerd.com/universal-binaries-for-mozilla-software/ "Blog post from 2006 about using my then-new MacBook Pro") on a cooling pad when docked at my desk; perhaps that will ultimately be the solution here as well. 

On the plus side, is an overused phrase. At least Apple are hitting a cadence with Mac updates for the first time in a while; it was getting difficult as a long-term Mac fan to see a future for the ecosystem when even the main manufacturer seemingly didn't care.

Here's hoping the MacBook Pro was rushed out now so they can spend time at WWDC announcing [the new Mac Pro](https://rubenerd.com/the-new-mac-pro-shall-be/). I've half-stepped out of the Mac ecosystem at this stage, but I still love macOS and want to see it continue to be a viable workstation.
