Jason Braganza [asked this question] on Stack Overflow in 2015:

> Is there a way to get custom RSS feeds with Ghost?

And the first comment, name withheld:

> Why a custom RSS feed? Why not use the default one?

In this case, Jason got the answer he needed from that person. But what about people coming to this page becuse its the first search result?

I feel like starting a new blog post series on people who respond to StackExchange questions with *why?*
