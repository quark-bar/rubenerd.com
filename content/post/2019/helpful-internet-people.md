It's time for the inaugural *[Draft Diving](https://rubenerd.com/tag/drafts/)* post, in which I dive into my drafts. That explanation isn't a tautology, because I don't call it that. 

Here's a quote from the [Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm/) I wrote in April 2016:

> **John:** Would be nice to have an option to make the HUD translucent, or do some other thing to prevent burn-in? And the big thread in their forums mostly consisted of people who don't own plasma televisions, telling everyone who does they shouldn't because they're bad and that's why they should get an "LED" television.

> **Marco:** Helpful internet people!
