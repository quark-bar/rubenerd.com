The entire time I was working in San Francisco, I kept hearing the automated announcer at Muni stations say ***Two Car, Shovel***. Turns out she was saying ***Two Car, Shuttle***. This mishearing has inextricably entered itself into our family folklore, much to Clara's chagrin.

The delightful RedKid site is still around, and I noticed it even has a [BART station generator](http://www.redkid.net/generator/bart/). Technically I was at the other Muni platform, but this still delighted me far more than it should have.

The [London Underground roundel generator](http://www.redkid.net/generator/underground/) worked a little less well. Cars Hovel?

And this [Roseland](http://www.redkid.net/generator/roseland/) one makes no sense.
