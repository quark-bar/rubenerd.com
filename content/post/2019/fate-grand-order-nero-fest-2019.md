If I had edicts of my own on this site, one would be that everyone must engage in at least one pointless, fun distraction. For me it's *[Fate/Grand Order](https://rubenerd.com/tag/fate-grand-order)* that I blogged about last year in the context of the [2018 Nero Fest](https://rubenerd.com/fate-grand-order-nero-fest-2018/):

> The only mobile game I play, and have ever got into, is *Fate/Grand Order*. Think *Hearthstone*, but with cute characters and familiar themes if you grew up watching the *Fate* franchise. And before you judge me, Clara is in way deeper than me!

Mashu will always be my favourite servant for `$REASONS`, but the various incantations of chaotic-good Nero are but a flaming red sword's width from being my second. [Wadarco](https://www.wadarco.info/works) is one of my favourite graphic artists and designers, and Sakura Tange does such a brilliant job acting her dialogue. Clara and I even say *Umu!* in real life now, likely to the chagrin of our friends and coworkers.

I [didn't summon Bride Umu](https://rubenerd.com/fate-grand-order-nero-fest-2018/) during last year's Nero Fest, but I was able to [rectify](https://rubenerd.com/medhis-mother-of-all-fullest-bridge-rectifiers/ "Medhi's mother of all fullest bridge rectifiers") this gross and horrifying injustice [back in April](https://rubenerd.com/a-second-chance-for-fgo-bride-umu/) this year with an unexpected bout of luck.

This year's summer event held the promise of Caster Nero, so I hoarded saint quarts for months instead of using them. It took more than 300 of those evil things but I managed to score her at the *last possible summon* before I ran out. `#boom!` Her card shows my favourite ascension art.

So now we come to *[Nero Fest](https://grandorder.wiki/Nero_Festival_Redux_2017)* again this year. The English *Fate/Grand Order* finally got the unlockable new costumes the Japanese version has had for a while, so we were able to unlock Nero's excitable gym outfit which is unreasonably cute, and also matches Heroine X!

<figure><p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/fgo-umu-gym@1x.jpg" alt="Screenshot showing Nero in her gym outfit" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/fgo-umu-gym@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/fgo-umu-gym@2x.jpg 2x" style="width:500px; height:281px;" /></p></figure>

Which reminds me, I need to go back to the gym. I realised this evening I'd have gone more often if Clara and I weren't playing *Fate/Grand Order* to get Umu in a gym outfit.
