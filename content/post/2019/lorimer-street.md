The [Equinix ME1](https://www.equinix.com.au/locations/asia-colocation/australia-colocation/melbourne-data-centers/) data centre in Melbourne is on Lorimer Street, so I see the address come up whenever we order cross connects for Victorian clients, or we fly down to do work. It's not that far from the centre of town, which is a pleasent change from how long it takes to get to SV2 in Santa Clara [from the SF office](https://rubenerd.com/caltrain-stilgherrian-vmisev/)!

But whenever I see the address, it reminds me of the Lorimer Street station on the New York M train. Clara and I took this line every day from our hotel in Brooklyn into Manhattan, and it holds a special place. We even have an orange M bullet fridge magnet from the [Transit Museum](https://www.nytransitmuseumstore.com/)! *Stand clear of the closing doors, please.*
