The mouth-foaming, hand-wringing responses to Greta Thunberg's rise has been fascinating to watch, if entirely predictable. She's become everything the anti-science crowd feared: an empathetic human face on irrefutable evidence. Her dissenters can't even say truthfully that she doesn't understand what she speaks of, given she consistently defers to those with expertise in her speeches. *Listen to scientists, not to me!*

The Murdoch press in Australia, and America's latest impeached President feel the need to whinge about her incessantly. If she was ineffectual, they wouldn't feel the need to rile up their base.

I haven't always agreed with Nobel Peace Prize recipients, or Time People of the Year. But this is well earned.
