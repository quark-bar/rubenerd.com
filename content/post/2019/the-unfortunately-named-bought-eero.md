[In 2016 I noted] the explosion of tech and engineering podcasts being sponsored by a WiFi equipment manufacturer called *Eero*, as opposed to a mattress.

I thought it was surprising and a tad funny their marketing department didn't check if it was a [common abbreviation] of an [unfortunate term] in this context. I chalked it up to having the same self-depracating humour I do. Or maybe they figured you can use Eeros to download ero. While you're on a mattress.

Now a large, and very well-known third party has bought them. I know the big fish eating smaller ones is increasingly—some may say depressingly—inevitable, but it's [not what people signed up for] when buying these devices

*(If the argument is people should have known they'd be bought, surely that's a broader indightment of the entire consumer technology industry right now).*

Eero made a big deal about protecting privacy. We'll see how their new corporate stewards handle it; we've all learned to be skeptical when reading assurances that *nothing will change*. Because they'll know whether you're downloading ero with your Eero.
