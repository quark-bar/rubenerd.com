Today I learned about <code>[fd]</code>, an alternative to <code>[find]</code> written in Rust. Its easy syntax is reason enough to use it, but check out the *speed* with which it found posts in this site's git repository:

    $ time find . -name *bsd*
    ==> real 0m0.595s
    ==> user 0m0.054s
    ==> sys  0m0.285s
      
       
    $ time fd bsd
    ==> real 0m0.030s
    ==> user 0m0.028s
    ==> sys  0m0.026s

This is now in my toolchain, so I can invoke *[Friar Duck]* for all searches. *To trip to trip it trip trip tripo tripa argh a trip a trippit trippit oh argh trippit oh trip it... tripping up and down! â™«*
