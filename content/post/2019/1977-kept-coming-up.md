Yesterday I was reading about the Glasgow Subway, then watched a video about the [retiring of the first cable-powered carriages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4VTltNg1FA) in 1977. Then John [mentioned on an episode](http://www.merlinmann.com/roderick/ep-354-the-hands-of-control.html) of Roderick on the Line that he had an adventure near the Lake Otis Parkway in Alaska in 1977.

What else happened during this time?

* The Commodore PET was demonstrated at CES in Chicago and first sold, Apple Computer was founded, the Tandy TRS-80 was announced, and Atari releases the Video Computer System.

* Jimmy Carter became US president, and Malcolm Fraser remained Prime Minister in Australia despite a 5 seat swing.

* First use of optical fibre to carry network traffic, and the first TCP/IP test connecting 3 ARPANET nodes succeeds.

* First test flight of a US space shuttle, on the 747 Shuttle Carrier. The wow signal is also detected by the Big Ear SETI radio telescope. And Voyager 1 is launched.

* The original Star Wars opened in theaters, setting the stage for the far superior Star Trek films to come after.

* In music, Toto is founded, Fleetwood Mac released *Rumours*, Steely Dan released *Aja*, Queen released *News of the World*, and both Elvis and The Supremes perform for the last time.
