Companies are [still] abusing their customer email lists to send unsolicited newsletters. Today’s culprit is an Australian IT retailer:

> **Welcome to our monthly newsletter**   
> A warm welcome to the launch issue of our newsletter, a monthly email bringing you only the most relevant and informative content. We’re always striving to unearth the best articles and deliver them directly to your inbox.

Your customers never signed up to this, including me! For those with email databases, please consider not doing this, it's not very nice.
