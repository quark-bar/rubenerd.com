Wadarco is rapidly becoming one of Clara's and my all time favourite artists. I know her best for her *Fate/Extra* and *Fate/Grand Order* illustrations, but she's also drawn characters for *Chain Chronicle*, a game of which I just learned. 

She recently contributed some coloured pencil art to *Fate/Grand Order Chaldea Ace Volume 2* which was adorable. Here's Mashu as a Sailor Moon-esque magical girl:

And the second page with Attila and Ereshkigal. Technically the first, but as cute and silly as it may be, they can't come before Mashu.
