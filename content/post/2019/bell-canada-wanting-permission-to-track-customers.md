[The Canadian Press is reporting]\:

> "Tailored marketing means Bell will be able to customize advertising based on participant account information and service usage patterns, similar to the ways that companies like Google and others have been doing for some time," the company says in recent notices to customers.

He's not wrong about Google. In fact, Bell is doing better by asking for permission instead of requiring an opt-out. But I'll bet that won't last.
