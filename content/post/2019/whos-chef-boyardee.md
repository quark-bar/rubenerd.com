I've always heard my American friends and TV shows namedrop Chef Boyardee, but I had no idea who he was. I heard him on *Good Mythical Morning* and decided enough was enough, so I decided to find out who this gentleman was.

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/chef-boyardee@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/chef-boyardee@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/chef-boyardee@2x.jpg 2x" alt="" style="width:320px" /></p>

He *was* a chef, but now his name graces canned foods. Above is his cheese ravioli in tomato and meat sauce, along with what I assume is a stylised image of the late gentleman himself.
