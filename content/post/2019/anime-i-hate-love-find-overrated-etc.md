* **Anime I hate:** None really, at best I'm indifferent. *[Kimi ga Nozomu Eien](https://myanimelist.net/anime/147/Kimi_ga_Nozomu_Eien/userrecs)*, one of the first series I ever watched, had an *infuriating* ending though!

* **Anime I think is overrated:** None really, see above. That said, I thought I'd enjoy *[One Piece](https://myanimelist.net/anime/21/One_Piece)* more given how popular it is. I found *[Fairy Tail](https://myanimelist.net/anime/6702/Fairy_Tail)* way more fun. I'd better not let my friend circle know.

* **Anime I think is underrated:** *[SKET Dance](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9863/SKET_Dance)*. It's one of the all time greats, but will always live under *Gintama's* albeit fabulous shadow. 

* **Anime I love:** *[Suzumiya Haruhi](https://myanimelist.net/anime/849/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu)*. It was my favourite till recently, perhaps at least in part due to nostalgia and the impact it had on me in the mid-2000s.

* **Anime I secretly love:** *[Clannad](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2167/Clannad)*, perhaps not so secretly. *Air* was a bit much though.

* **Favorite anime of all time:** *[Barakamon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/22789/Barakamon)*, didn't even need to think twice. Everything else about why I love it aside, it's about a gentleman rekindling joy for his craft in beautiful new surroundings having living under pressure, which I can appreciate right now.

*Under pressure, dun-dun-dun da-da dun-dun. â™«*
