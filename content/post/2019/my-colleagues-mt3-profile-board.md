One of my American colleagues and keyboard afficinados has just built a new keyboard, which I threatened to post here in a fit of jealously. They're based on [MT3 profile keys] which look unreasonably comfortable, especially when compared to the piece of junk Apple keyboards we all use on the go.

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/grrr-mt3@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/grrr-mt3@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/grrr-mt3@2x.jpg 2x" alt="" style="width:500px" /></p>

Note the modern vintage typeography, and Filco handrest. This gentleman means business.
