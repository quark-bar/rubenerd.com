It's a weird, bittersweet moment this morning. I'm a morning person, so for the last two years I've been coming to this coffee shop across the road from our office for coffee, reading news, blogging, SSHing, and checking my calendars to prepare for the day. Chances are much of what you're read here for a while has been written over a batch brew here.

Our office is moving to a awesome new terrace-style building in another part of town, because we're sick of being in a corporate, open plan office. And so ends this morning ritual.

The staff are lovely, the coffee is among the best in Sydney, and I love the surroundings. Please do pay them a visit if you're in Ultimo or surrounds; they're across the street from the Powerhouse Museum. Try and get there on Tuesdays if you want to see and smell their [roasting machine](https://www.instagram.com/p/B1r447SAnrD/).
