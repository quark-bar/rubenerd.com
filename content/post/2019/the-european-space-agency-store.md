I mentioned the European Space Agency in my [Chrysler Building post] because I found out today they have a [web store]. It's one of those outsourced, print to order places, but they still have some cool stuff.

The *Sailor Moon* franchise made me a Mercury fan, but I think the ESA's Neptune hoodie design is the best. As most obviously with the Saturn design, it has circles for each of its rings. What a brilliant visualisation. 

Below are Sailor Neptune and the hoodie, in an order I'd hope you'd be able to discern.
