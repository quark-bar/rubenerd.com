You've all been very patient with my laptop coffee shop travels over the last few weeks, so as a reward consider this the last for this trip. I'm at one of my favourite places to work in the whole world: Case Verde in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The sounds of the fountains and birds are rather lovely.

Clara and I will be heading back to Sydney in the next few days. It's weird, I don't feel like I've been on holiday; more like I just picked up life where I left off. Australia is nice, but at the risk of contradicting that Peter Allen song [made famous by Qantas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbGuqmaDgLA), it's not home.
