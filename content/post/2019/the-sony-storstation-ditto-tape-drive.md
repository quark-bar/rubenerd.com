Everyone knew Iomega's colourful Zip, Jaz, and Ditto drives in the 1990s, but fewer were aware that Iomega allowed third parties to manufacturer their media under licence. My dad bought me FujiFilm Zip disks in primary school because they were a bit cheaper in packs of ten, and I saw a few co-branded laptop drives back in the day.

Today I learned Sony rebranded the Ditto tape drive as the StorStation, not to be confused with their more recent tape devices. It had the same enclosure as the [maroon Ditto](https://rubenerd.com/ditto/) but was coloured beige instead:

Thanks to [dig_in_and_dig_on eBay](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/Sony-StorStation-2GB-PPT-Parallel-Port-Computer-to-Tape-Backup-IO2000-PX/113755330077) for listing this rare find. I'd buy it for my vintage peripheral collection, but it's already ludicrously overstocked as it is; especially for someone pretending to get rid of stuff.
