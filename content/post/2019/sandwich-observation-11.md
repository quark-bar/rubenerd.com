It's been eleven years *to the day* since our first [Grilled Cheese Sandwich Observation](https://rubenerd.com/tag/grilled-cheese-sandwich-observation/) lesson, and almost three years since the last one. This cannot stand.

The <del>above</del> below photograph I took at [% Arabica](https://arabica.coffee/en/location/arabica-kyoto-arashiyama/) on my birthday this year in Kyoto does not depict a grilled cheese sandwich, and quite frankly it concerns me that you think it does.

Thank you.
