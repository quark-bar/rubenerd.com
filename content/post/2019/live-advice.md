This was from [@NyadolNyuon]\:

> I was once given useful advice: never let anyone scare you into silence.

I forgot that one, too many times. My mum had a corollary: never give the bastards the satisfaction of knowing they've got to you. They're not absolutes, and are often easier said than done, but I think they help.

*<strong>Update:</strong> I misspelled life as live in the URL for this post. I like it.*
