I think I set a new personal record of spelling mistakes on my [bzip2 KornShell](https://rubenerd.com/bzip2-and-kornshell-fun/) post on Monday:

> I had experience with the KornShell from NetBSD, so I started using it **everwhere**. It has Bourne **comaptibility**, with a few interactive **nicities**. I installed ksh93 and left it at that, but have **sicne** learned there are a few offshoots, including the Public Domain pdksh and MirOS mksh variants.

I was sure the word *offshoots* was supposed to have a hyphen, but [wordnet](https://rubenerd.com/problematical/) alleviated this misapprehension. But then I had to confirm *misapprehension* didn't need a hyphen, which was an interesting offshoot. And the cycle continued until someone threw a [last](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/last.html) my way.

I'll admit, I typed this post on my phone coming back from work, then posted as-is when I got home. The urge to write strikes at odd times, especially in the shower for some reason. There's an old school joke about [SOAP](https://rubenerd.com/remember-soap/) payloads in there somewhere. Or is it *old-school*? **GAH.**

I wonder if there's a way to `set spell` by default for `.md` files in Vim?
