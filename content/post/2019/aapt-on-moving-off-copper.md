A warning message from AAPT when provisioning new circuits:

> The National Broadband Network (NBN) is progressively rolling out its network across Australia and as such, the copper access network is being shut down.  To this end, during the Contract Term, you or your customer are likely to be notified that certain Services to one or more Sites will be disconnected (Affected Service).  We will provide a minimum of 60 days' notice to Customer prior to disconnection.  During the notice period, you or your customer may migrate to another Service offered or cancel and move to another provider.  The alternative service may be more expensive than or have different characteristics to, the Affected Service.  You and/or your customer have the responsibility to arrange for new services to be deployed (whether by ordering a replacement service or connecting to another provider) before the disconnection date.

Also note the progressive phasing out of ISDN, and moving faxes to IP. Yes, the world still runs on faxes.
