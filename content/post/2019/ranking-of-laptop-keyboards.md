My [comment about Apple keyboards] yesterday made me think which laptops I've owned. This is a list of ones with excellent keyboards:

* ThinkPad, all of them
* Toshiba Satellite T2150
* First-gen MacBook Pro
* Official foldable external keyboard for my Palm III

These were passable:

* iBook G3
* MacBook Air 2013
* Compaq Armada M300
* Toshiba Libretto 70CT, amazing given the size

These weren't great:

* GPD Pocket, but understandable given the size
* Every iPad keyboard cover I've tried to use
* The HP 620LX, the later Journadas were better

And these are just bad:

* A broken table that's also on fire and looks bad
* Hitting my fingers repeatedly with a ball-peen hammer
* Latest MacBook Pros, including ones with ingress rubber
