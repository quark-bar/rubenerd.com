Hi there, and welcome to another in our long-running [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday/) series. That being the royal *our*, becuase it's [just me](https://rubenerd.com/about/) writing these.

Today's song is the Pet Shop Boys warning us about Silicon Valley in their 1985 single, *[Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PyeWRd7ZEBs)*:

> I can program a computer;   
> Choose the perfect time.   
> If you've got the inclination;   
> I've got the crime. â™«

Okay it probably wasn't about that *specifically*, but I still love the lyric.
