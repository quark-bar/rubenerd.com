Our Australian home internet finally churned from SkyMesh to Bevan Slattery's [Superloop] that bought the former last year. I got this message:

> Hi Ruben, your service transition to Superloop is now complete. You may experience 10-20 minutes of downtime. If you experience any ongoing downtime, please power cycle your router and then contact our support team on $REDACTED. Thank you.

Our connection was down for hours, though that was certainly the fault of NBNco. As promised, our existing <abbr title="Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet">PPPoE</abbr> creds still worked.

With this complete, we have a week [before we move]. We've been tentatively told our new apartment has <abbr title="fibre to the basement">FTTB</abbr> that should be compatible with their service; hopefully it's true. Australian internet is such a crapshoot.

We were extraordinarily lucky that <abbr title="fibre to the node">FTTN</abbr> worked well for us here; the antiquated, high-voltage Malcolm Turnbull box was right outside our complex, and evening speeds were never too much of an issue. That said, Superloop has already been noticeably faster.

*Update, 12th February:* We moved house, and have now been waiting six days for them to transfer to our new address. Multiple days between support tickets and updates. Not impressed.
