My brain has got to the point where it filters news about Mr Orange automatically. But this one slipped through the cracks, like a supine slurry of cheap citrus cordial; desperate to taste like the real thing, but fooling fewer and fewer people. Or *less* people, as he'd say.

Mr Orange walked out of a meeting with the congressional Democrats, tweeting it was a "waste of time" and "bye-bye". The American government shutdown is now well into its millionth week, to use one his rally estimations.

I'm confused as to why it's hard, he said he'd make Mexico pay for it. He wasn't being figurative, he literally quoted [specific dollar figures] and consequences if they didn't comply with his demands. 

That said, this was the guy who ~~authored~~ ~~coauthored~~ appeared on the cover of *The Art of the Deal*. If the livelihoods of federal workers weren't in the mix, this [dummy spit] would be hilarious.
