A couple of digressions aside, I've always alternated between Apple notebooks, and BSD (or Linux) powered ThinkPads. If you have nothing better to do and check out the [archives](https://rubenerd.com/archives/), you'll likely find writing from iBooks and X40s, to MacBook Pros and T420s. My first laptop was a hand-me-down ThinkPad 600E from my dad, and my first new one was an iBook G3.

This seems to confound people: surely you can't like both! While they differ in several critical ways, they're also similar in the ways they're different: 

* Both were aspirational to me. The rounded black PowerBook with that white Apple was *so cool*, and the ThinkPad screamed utilitarian class.

* They're premium/expensive, at least compared to junk laptops.

* They both unapologetically serve their target markets, and have fircely-loyal followings.  Read into that what you will.

* They're instantly recognisable and a clear lineage; arguably not an easy feat when you're essentially dealing with a hinged screen and keyboard.

* They're often pitted against each other in reviews, probably due to their similar price points.

* They tend to draw ire or praise from anyone who see them. They're either attractive, well designed machines, or overpriced and stale.

I'll admit my use case is a little odd, because I don't run Windows on ThinkPads, and until recently my Macs were dual-booted. Either way, I'm sure I'll anger at least a few people in both camps with this.
