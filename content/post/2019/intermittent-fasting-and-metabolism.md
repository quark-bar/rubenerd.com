There's a resurgent interest online about intermittent fasting, based on the increase in tweets, news articles, and videos being posted about it. Most extrapolate off a research paper published in 2016, titled [Intermittent Fasting and Human Metabolis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4516560/). It concluded:

> It is well known that in humans, even a single fasting interval (e.g., overnight) can reduce basal concentrations of metabolic biomarkers associated with chronic disease such as insulin and glucose. For example, patients are required to fast for 8â€“12 hours before blood draws to achieve steady-state fasting levels for many metabolic substrates. Therefore the important clinical and scientific question is whether adoption of a regular intermittent fasting regimen is a feasible and sustainable population-based strategy for promoting metabolic health. In addition, research is needed to test whether these regimens can complement or replace energy restriction and if so, whether they support long-term weight management. Below, we briefly summarize the major conclusions that can be drawn based on the current evidence. 

Click through and read all their findings, it's well worth it.

I was told the story growing up that you needed to eat a huge breakfast, and then many times during the day. It always felt like a struggle, unless it was a treat when travelling. So I decided to skip breakfast beyond some water and a black coffee most days since early February, and felt no difference in energy. And without any other changes in my lifestyle, I've gone down a belt hole size.

Vague anecdotes based on a paper concluding more research needs to be done is almost, but not entirely, meaningless. But passing on out of interest.
