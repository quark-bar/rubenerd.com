I've talked before about how fascinating eBay is for learning about vintage computer hardware. We have two friggen *awesome* oddities today.

The first is a 5.25-inch external Commodore SFD-1001 unit from 1984-85. If you hadn't heard of it before, me too. I have a dark brown 1541 drive that matches the original Commodore 64, but I'd never heard of this one before. According to the [ever-reliable C64 Wiki](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/SFD-1001), it was five times faster than the 1541. Thanks to [altamontfinds](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Commodore-SFD-1001-Case-Internal-Drive-Cage-IEEE-Bare-Floppy-Drive-No-Chips/192899323712) for the image:

Last year I wrote about the [Epson SD800/SD700 unit](https://rubenerd.com/epsons-classic-combo-floppy-drives/) that combines a 3.5-inch and 5.25-inch drive into one 5.25-inch bay. Turns out Teac also made one, the FD-505. Thanks to [zacmis](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Teac-FD-505-19307572-09-3-5-5-25-Combo-Dual-Internal-Floppy-Disk-Drive-FDD/123658080371) for the image:

You could put your Teac FD-505 into an empty Commodore SFD-1001, and feed the ribbons out to your vintage computer tower. That'd be amazing.
