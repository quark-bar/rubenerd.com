It's [Music Monday](https://rubenerd.com/tag/music-monday/) time again. Each and every Monday, though maybe not, I post a link to a song you can use your ears to process if you feel so inclined. Today's is a song I hadn't heard in *years* but I loved as a kid. Youssou sings in English, French, and West African Wolof.

This was huge in Australia and Singapore in 1994, but according to Wikipedia it got limited play in North America. Consider this recified if you find yourself domiciled in the latter location now.
