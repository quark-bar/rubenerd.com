Ben Weir [reported on the Church of Scientology] for the Sydney Morning Herald, quoting a recent defector:

> "Australian recruits have dwindled to virtually zero as media coverage and access to the Internet has ensured the truth about the cult is well-known here" Mr Schofield said.

Good! 

It’s also a relief to see the Internet being used to disseminate truth, especially with all the conspiracy theories and *alternative facts* swaying public opinion and policy, right up to Prime Ministers and Presidents. I get so jaded with that dull, pandering nonsense I forget about the Internet’s capacity for good.
