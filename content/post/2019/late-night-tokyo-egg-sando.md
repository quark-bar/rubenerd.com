Clara and I are back in Japan, and I was eagerly anticipating chowing down on egg sandwich from one of the many fine convenience store chains. They're *criminally* good; I don't know if they put a *Futurama-esque* secret ingredient for true flavour in 

I'd been waiting since this time last year to go back to Japan and chow down on a convenience store egg sandwich. It may appear to be a odd comestible obsession given the wide variety of incredible food the country has to offer, but they're *unreasonably good*.

So jetlagged and hungry, Clara and I ventured across the street from the de-facto AsiaBSDCon Hotel to the 7-11. **They didn't have any**, though they did have a certain Dungeon Hestia anime.

We walked across the street again, this time to our closest Lawson. Once again, the **didn't have any**! The absence of this convenience store staple so bewildered me I started recording photographic evidence.

Fortunately third time was the charm! Family Mart always delivers :)
