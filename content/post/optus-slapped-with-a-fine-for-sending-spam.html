<p>According to a story released just hours ago from the <a href="http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/">Adelaide Now</a> website, Optus has been fined AU$110,000 for sending text message spam which was sent from a misleading phone number.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,24911924-5005962,00.html">the report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fine is the second biggest penalty imposed for a breach of Australia’s anti-spam laws.</p>
<p>The messages promoted the OptusZoo entertainment service to customer mobile phones and used the sender identification 966.</p>
<p>Optus assumed recipients would make the connection between 966 on a mobile phone keypad, and the word &#8220;ZOO&#8221; which can also be spelt out using the three numbers, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) said.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, this was not considered sufficient identification, as &#8216;966’ could be used to represent any number of permutations on a telephone keypad,&#8221; ACMA chairman Chris Chapman said in a statement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Somehow their reasoning that everyone would know what that number means does sound just a little fishy. It sounds like a classic case of intentional obfuscation, then denial to me. It seems hard to believe that someone could really think a three digit number could translate using a keypad into <em>&quot;Zoo&quot;</em> which we&#39;re supposed to associate with one of their products.</p>
<p>If the numbers when entered into a phone magically spelt the word <em>&quot;Optus&quot;</em> I&#39;d perhaps be marginally more forgiving… but <em>&quot;Zoo&quot;</em>? How many Optus customers are even aware that they&#39;re using that service?</p>
<p>Optus is of course Australia&#39;s number 2 telecommunications company behind Telstra. Writing this from Singapore is ironic given Singapore Telecom owns Optus. Budda boom.</p>
