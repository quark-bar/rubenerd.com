<p>Enough talk already! After weighing up all the options, I finally plonked down the dough and ordered a <a href="http://pckeyboards.stores.yahoo.net/keyboards.html">Unicomp</a> <a href="http://pckeyboards.stores.yahoo.net/en104bl.html">SpaceSaver</a> buckling spring keyboard. While I was drawn to the retro beige and light grey key colour scheme I ended up getting the black and grey version so it would match my Apple hardware, Samsung monitors and whatnot. Plus it looks just like my Commodore 16 :-D.</p>
<p>Despite having some older machines that only recognise PS/2 and that I could only configure an alternative key layout if I used the PS/2 version, I opted for USB. I already carry far too many adaptors, dongles and other riff raff between Singapore and Adelaide as it is, and I worry a PS/2 to USB adaptor would just be another thing to lose. Plus, I&#39;ve read the IBM Model M series keyboards draw far more power than regular keyboards and that you need an active converter rather than just an adaptor to change the signals. Not sure if that&#39;s true for the Unicomp keyboards too, but I figured I may as well play it safe.</p>
<p>If you skipped my obsessive coverage of keyboards of late (<a style="font-style:italic;" href="http://rubenerd.com/ibm-model-m-northgate/">IBM Model M and Northgate Omnikey keyboards</a> and <a style="font-style:italic;" href="http://rubenerd.com/unicomp-cvt-keyboards/">Unicomp and CVT keyboards</a>), Unicomp manufacture keyboards to the same specifications as the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard">IBM Model M</a> keyboards from the 1980s that use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling_spring">buckling springs</a> which feel much nicer to type on and give a classic audible click with each keystroke. I was able to use a classic IBM keyboard back in Adelaide at my university and it really does make a <em>huge</em> difference.</p>
<p>While I do love the <a href="http://www.apple.com/keyboard/">svelte keyboards Apple are currently producing</a> and will continue to use them on my other machines (even my non-Macs!) I&#39;m looking forward to using this IBM/Unicomp keyboard for programming and writing blog posts.</p>
<p>10-15 business daysâ€¦ I might explode waiting that long! Yes, I get excited about computer keyboards, shaddup.</p>
