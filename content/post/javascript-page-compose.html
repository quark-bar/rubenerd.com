<p>Unless the purpose of your site is to be an Ajax application, regardless of whether you&#39;re using it to dynamically load in comments on pages from services such as <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, or your own comment systems on sites such as <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/">Lifehacker</a>, or for some reason static text and images, using JavaScript to compose pages is just a dumb thing to do.</p>
<p>I linked to <a href="http://www.nationals.org.au/">The Nationals</a> (an Australian political party) for a joke on a <a href="http://rubenerd.com/anime-saki-03/">previous post</a> and noticed this garbled mess of text and images along with an appropriate image of an irritated kid, presumably because he&#39;s just as unimpressed as I am and feels bad being associated with such a page! I shouldn&#39;t have to <a href="http://noscript.net/">re-enable JavaScript</a> just to read a static web page.</p>
<p>Friends, don&#39;t let your web designer friends use JavaScript to compose pages!</p>
