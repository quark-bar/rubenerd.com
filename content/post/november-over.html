<p>As I sit here in the dark late this evening playing some Michael Franks holiday music and drinking a frosty glass of water, I&#39;m reminded of late October when I said November was going to be terrible and it couldn&#39;t end soon enough. Well it&#39;s ended, and I&#39;m so relieved I&#39;m giddy :).</p>

<p>Leaving aside family problems, this full time semester has been rough (relatively speaking of course!). After taking a leave of absence to look after my mum in her last few years and my subsequent studies part time, I&#39;m far behind most people of my age. Heck, virtually everyone who started studying at the same time I did have already graduated or begun Masters degrees.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure whether those two factors had anything to do with it, and certainly the material I was studying wasn&#39;t overly more difficult than what I&#39;d done before, but this semester was <strong>hard</strong>. I worried about things that I didn&#39;t think were worrying at all before. I felt as though I was going backwards.</p>
<p>Anyway the exams are over, the assignments have been handed in and on Thursday night I&#39;ll be back in Singapore for the first part of the holidays. I like Adelaide, but at the moment my mind associates it withâ€¦ studying. And having Christmas in Munich and New Year in Paris is going to be amazing.</p>
<p>I whinge about workload, aforementioned family problems and a rather pathetic 23 year old midlife crisis, but I am a friggen lucky guy. I guess its easier to think that after the major hurdles have been jumped over instead of when you&#39;re staring at them.</p>
