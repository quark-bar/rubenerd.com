<p>More disturbing news is appearing regarding Israeli treatment of Palestinians. I don&#39;t know why I find it more abhorrent, but I feel much sadder when I know it&#39;s children being abused.</p>
<p><a href="http://dissidentvoice.org/2009/06/all-in-a-day%E2%80%99s-work-for-the-israeli-army-beating-and-torturing-children/">From the Dissident Voice</a> by <a href="http://www.jkcook.net/">Jonathan Cook</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://dissidentvoice.org/2009/06/all-in-a-day%E2%80%99s-work-for-the-israeli-army-beating-and-torturing-children/"><p>Nazareth — The rights of Palestinian children are routinely violated by Israel’s security forces, according to a new report that says beatings and torture are common. In addition, hundreds of Palestinian minors are prosecuted by Israel each year without a proper trial and are denied family visits.</p>
<p>The findings by Defense for Children International (DCI) come in the wake of revelations from Israeli soldiers and senior commanders that it is “normal procedure” in the West Bank to terrorise Palestinian civilians, including children.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m aware there are Palestinian extremists who routinely sent rockets into Israel that harm and kill innocent civilians, and I am also aware that Israel has the right to defend itself. That said, they&#39;re not doing their cause or standing any good by being just as morally objectionable and lowering themselves to the same level as their enemies.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve said this on Twitter before: this far-right wing government in Israel is scary. Which is a shame because Israel is one of the places I&#39;d like to visit one day.</p>
