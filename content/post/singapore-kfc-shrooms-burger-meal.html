<p>So I was looking through some of my archived school work on my backup DVDs, and right there in one of the folders in my Year 12 High School disc dated Wedesday 03rd March 2004:</p>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/media.kfc-image1.jpg" alt="KFC Shrooms Burger Meal" style="width:90%"/></p>
<p>If you&#39;re a Singaporean, do you remember the TV ads where the office worker is sitting in Raffles Place with a napkin over his chest like a bib eating the Shrooms burger, and the sauce is oozing everywhere and splatting people? Is splatting a word? Mmmâ€¦ mushrooms!</p>
<p>Talk about a blast from the past, I havn&#39;t seen that ad in ages! :D</p>
