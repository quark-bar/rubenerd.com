<p>Whether I&#39;m on a machine with Mac OS X, FreeBSD, GNU/Linux or heaven forbid Windows, I use the <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC Media Player</a> for watching video because it&#39;s simply the best media player ever made, full stop. Well after over ten years of development, the VLC media has reached the big version 1.0 and <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">it&#39;s now available for download</a>. This is huge!</p>
<p>I want to send out a huge thank you and congratulations to the people at the VideoLAN project for their amazing product and for all their long years of hard work.</p>
