<p>A wow moment after reading <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/microsoft-invest-300-million-barnes-nobles-digital-business-105255716.html">Yahoo News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Microsoft Corp will invest $300 million in Barnes &#038; Noble Incâ€™s digital and college businesses, valuing them at $1.7 billion. [..] Microsoft will get a 17.6 percent stake in the new unit, while Barnes &#038; Noble will own about 82.4 percent</p></blockquote>
<p>This has the potential to shake things up big time, if they play it right. Will the Nook become a Windows Mobile device? Will Microsoft use B&amp;N in their phone&#39;s media store to take on the iPhone and iTunes? Will this largely ignored mobile platform and this runner-up to Amazon fizzle out? I don&#39;t know! The battle lines are being drawn though. </p>
<p>And before anyone asks, yes I know that Jeff Bezos is the CEO of Amazon, I just thought it was a fitting image!</p>
