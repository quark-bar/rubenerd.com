<p>SEO spammers are a unique breed. Whereas most people are happy to sell you junk, these people make it out that your very business is at stake. They're the online equivilent of a website protection racket. The good news is it's all baloney.</p>

<p>(Google's closed search algoritms don't help this. In fact, I'd say the entire SEO industry is built on Google's obtuseness).</p>

<p>Today's message was unique in that it even included contradictions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My name is Emily, I work as a Search Specialist for a Marketing Company in Sydney, anyway I came across your site while doing some research in your industry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And which industry would that be? But I digress; this was her footer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Headquarters:  Office 7003 X2 Tower,Cluster X, Melbourne Vic. 3000,Australia Other Offices: NZ | China | USA | Singapore | UAE</p>
</blockquote>

<p>3000 is Melbourne's post code, but the rest of the address doesn't exist there. It's also not Sydney, where she claimed to work. A quick search of their address returned <a href="http://www.seospammersexposed.com/web-analytics-media-seo-spam-india/">this post</a> on SEO Spammers Exposed, which includes the same fake address.</p>

<p>I suppose spammers assume that an address; even a poorly formatted one; lends just enough credibility to sucker more people in.</p>
