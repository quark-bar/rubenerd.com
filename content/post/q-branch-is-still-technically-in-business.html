<p>John Gruber <a href="http://inessential.com/2015/06/02/resigning_from_q_branch">recently blogged</a> about the departure of Brent Simmons from Q Branch, the company that built his Vesper notes application.

<blockquote>
<p>For Q Branch and Vesper, life goes on. We don’t have anything to announce today, other than that this is not the end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here's John Gruber about <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2013/08/13/blackberry">Blackberry's troubles</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hate to toot my own horn, but I called it back in 2008, while BlackBerry’s (née RIM’s) share price was still over $150, and where by “hate” I mean “smugly enjoy”.</p>
