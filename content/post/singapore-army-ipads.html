<blockquote><p><a title="Guns, grenades and iPads for Singapore soldiers - Yahoo! News" href="http://old.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110627/tc_afp/singaporemilitaryinternettechnologyipadusapple">SINGAPORE (AFP)</a> – New recruits to Singapore’s military, air force and navy are to get a new standard-issue item of equipment besides their rifle &#8212; the iPad. [..] The defence ministry said Monday it will be issuing &#8220;about 8,000&#8243; of the sleek, touch-screen tablet computers &#8212; already wildly popular with the city-state’s tech-savvy youth &#8212; to recruits from November.</p></blockquote>
<p>I originally wrote that I&#39;d prefer governments <a href="http://rubenerd.com/government-ipads/" title="Friday 12th November 2010: Government use of iPads?">used Android devices</a> because they were open to different OEMs, but given the latest versions <a title="Wednesday 30th March 2011: Google closed Honeycomb, so what?" href="http://rubenerd.com/google-honeycomb/">aren&#39;t open and are limited too</a>, I guess my point was moot. <a href="https://meego.com/">MeeGo</a> instead? :D</p>
