<p>I noticed this morning on the side of Twitter profiles a question hyperlink had sprouted. Clicking it took me to a form where the Twitter folks asked &quot;Why do you use Twitter?&quot; along with the promise of a Jeep Wrangler if I answered. I&#39;d heard <a href="http://www.wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Wheat_berries#What_do_I_do_with_wheatberries.3F">similar promises before</a>, but I figured I&#39;d give it a shot:</p>
<blockquote><p>
What don’t I use it for? I use it as a replacement for SMS on my phone using m.twitter.com, as a replacement for a blog aggregator for urgent news where time is critical, to meet and talk with people near me, to meet and talk with people on the other side of the planet from me, to get questions on any topic imaginable answered in a flash by all kinds of people, to keep up to date with big names in tech, to post humerous signs I’ve just read, to let people know when I’ve created a new weblog entry, to let people know when I’ve updated my podcast, to clean the glass in my windows, to use as a replacement for salad dressing…</p>
<p>Oh, and and to let people know what I’m doing in 140 characters or less.
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s a shame, I&#39;m learning how to ride a motor scooter not a car right now. I guess I could sell it and buy lots and lots of computer equipment. Like a rack full of <a href="http://www.apple.com/xserve/">Xserves</a>.</p>
