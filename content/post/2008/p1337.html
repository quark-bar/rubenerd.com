<p>I&#39;ve known for a while now that post ID numbers don&#39;t correlate with the actual number of the post. For example, this post is the 810th published post but the internal ID is 1337. It seems the gap between the actual post number and the ID seems to be widening even faster now that <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> keeps history of posts as well, as I understand it.</p>
<p>Aside from a few lingering problems, I can&#39;t wait to move over to my own rolled eruby system, it&#39;ll be great to be able to reference a post with the number it actually is! Imagine it: I could tell people to look up post number 810, and it would actually be post number 810 not 1337!</p>
<p>And because this post is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">1337</a>, here&#39;s an obligatory picture of people wielding swords:</p>

<cite>Yagami Kazuma and Kannagi Ayano from <a href="http://pc.webnt.jp/stigma/">Kaze no Stigma</a>. They both look really angry for some reason: nice colours though!</cite></p>
