<p><em>This issue has been resolved by the folks at Ourmedia. It did turn out to be a technical problem. I would like to thank them for their quick reply and action, I appreciate it.</em></p>
<p>Back in early 2005 when I started recording the <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">Rubenerd Show</a>, I discovered through an early show from <a href="http://itconversations.com/">IT Conversations</a> a website called <a href="http://ourmedia.org/">Ourmedia</a> created by <a href="http://www.jdlasica.com/">JD Lasica</a> and <a href="http://marc.blogs.it/">Marc Canter</a>. Essentially it was a service for free and independent media that you could upload your material onto with the guarantee that it would stay there.</p>
<p>All in all Rubenerd Shows 014 to 066 were uploaded to Ourmedia and were accessible from my generously provided profile page at <a href="http://ourmedia.org/user/38566/">http://ourmedia.org/user/38566/</a>. In doing so I was able to tag shows, group them together and share them with other people in the system and through external links. I made friends. I discovered other people and materials. It was lots of fun. Unfortunately when I realised that I was going to do many more Rubenerd Shows than I had originally anticipated, I decided to revert back to my own servers because I just didn&#39;t feel right using so much of their bandwidth, and it would only increase as I uploaded more stuff.</p>
<p>With the <a href="http://theovernightscape.com/">Overnightscape</a> <a href="http://onsug.com/archives/category/rampler">Rampler</a> spinoff show in full swing, I thought I had finally figured out a  less selfish way of using Ourmedia by uploading material I had recorded raw for others to listen to, but more importantly to resample and edit as people see fit in the spirit of <a href="http://creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> and the <a href="http://artlibre.org/licence/lal/en/">Free Art Licence</a>.</p>

<cite>Ourmedia saying Rubenerd doesn&#39;t exist</cite></p>
<p>Well here we are three years later from when I registered, and I&#39;ve learned the hard way never to trust third parties again with my content! My profile page now redirects to a search page. I was given no warning whatsoever, and the page that replaced mine doesn&#39;t even reference me in any way. Doing a search on Ourmedia for <em>&quot;Ruben Schade&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;Rubenerd&quot;</em> return no results.</p>
<p>The creepy thing is part of the reason I stopped using it was because I felt uncomfortable having so much of my content on a server I didn&#39;t control. Ourmedia had so much potential, and I had a great way to use it. I&#39;m hoping this is a technical glitch and not a deletion!</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>I just checked, and I can still access my <a href="http://ourmedia.org/user/38566/blog/">Ourmedia Blog</a>, but when you click the Rubenerd producer link, you are redirected to the empty search page. Perhaps this is a technical glitch? It&#39;s strange because as far as I can tell no other user has been affected, I can navigate hundreds of profiles without a problem.</p>
<p><a href="http://ourmedia.org/user/38566/links">My page listing the content I&#39;ve uploaded</a> is also available, but none of the links work.</p>
