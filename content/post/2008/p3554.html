<p>For a period of time in 2004 to 2006 I was the proud owner of a (then new) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G5">Power Mac G5</a> desktop that could effortlessly breeze through any task I gave it, and a cute little old 12&quot; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBook_G3#iBook_G3_Dual_USB_.2812.1-inch_and_14.1-inch.29">iBook G3</a> that was hopelessly underpowered but was perfect for taking to school for note taking, web browsing and for importing photos from cameras and the like. When I ran into money troubles I had to give up the G5 tower, opting instead to buy an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Pro#Discrete-construction_MacBook_Pro">original generation Core Duo MacBook Pro</a> as it&#39;s replacement a few months later. I figured I could replace both the portable iBook and the muscular G5 with one machine. Pure, unfiltered genius!</p>
<p>While we&#39;ve both had some issues with each other over the years as many couples do, this MacBook Pro has performed amazingly well in this dual role. We&#39;ve had a productive and fruitful partnership :-).</p>
<p>Since 2006 though I feel as if I&#39;ve made significant changes to how I work, and I&#39;m staring to long for the days when I had a killer machine and a lightweight one.</p>
<p>Even just a few months ago I would lug my MacBook Pro around everywhere without thinking twice; now I&#39;ve relegated my email, Twitter and light note taking duties entirely to my iPhone. My tiny magnesium <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1119/">Armada M300</a> or my iBook G3 (both from 2002) could also fill this role really nicely, no worries.</p>
<p>As for my current Core Duo MacBook Pro, being 32 bit I&#39;ve been hitting the RAM ceiling more and more these days and for some major video editing and project compiling it&#39;s <strong>really</strong> showing its age: the current crop of Core 2 Duo machines can run laps around it. If I had the money (<em>and that is a <strong>VERY BIG IF!</strong></em>), I&#39;d love to grab a new 17 inch MacBook Pro. It would be my primary machine but would serve much less than a laptop and more as a portable desktop replacement that would sit on the table here most of the time but that I could easily pack up and take with me as I switch from Singapore to Adelaide and back again, and again and again.</p>
<p>I&#39;d better start saving. Does the Red Cross <em>buy</em> blood now?</p>
