<p>Welcome to your second grilled cheese sandwich observation lesson. If you missed our first lesson, feel free to <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1284/">refer back to it</a> before proceeding. And as usual, feel free to take notes.</p>
<p>As far as I know this is <strong><em>not</em></strong> a grilled cheese sandwich, and quite frankly it concerns me that you think it is. Please seek counseling.</p>
