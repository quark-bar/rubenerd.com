<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I may have spoken prematurely: they may still be supporting FOTF after all. Bummer. Will be keeping an eye on this.</p></blockquote>
<p>After no doubt responding to a deluge of complaints from a lion&#39;s share of the Singaporean blogging community, <a href="http://dbs.com.sg/">DBS Bank</a> seems to have backtracked on their pledge to automatically donate funds to the ultra-conservative Focus on the Family organisation whenever customers use their DBS credit cards at selected shopping centres this holiday season. If you browse to the exact page I referenced in my <a href="//rubenerd.com/p3324/">first post on the subject</a>, you&#39;ll notice that any references to FOTF have been removed from their <a href="http://dbs.com.sg/sg/personal/cards/promotions/xmas2008/">Christmas 2008 promotion</a>.</p>
<p>I suspect DBS wanted to show some goodwill, but didn&#39;t realise what dark motives the organisation they decided to support really has. At least that&#39;s what I would like to think.</p>
<p>Regardless though, this is fantastic news and I suspect a real boon for the majority of DBS Bank&#39;s customers. I graciously applaud DBS&#39;s decision and have decided to keep my POSB and DBS accounts. I will advise my family and friends in Singapore that it is safe to use their DBS cards after all.</p>
<p>Xie xie! :)</p>
