<blockquote><strong>Afterword:</strong> After posting this entry thinking nobody would really read it, I received comments from five fantastic people who have all made me rethink this issue from the ground up… not to mention make me wish I had spent more time on this post in the first place!</p>
<p>You can read my gigantic reponse along with these comments (surprisingly!) <strong><a href="//rubenerd.com/p1100/#comments">in the comments section</a></strong>. Thank everyone for your help and feedback, you've all really helped a lot.</p>

<p>It seems there&#39;s a growing number of people who aren&#39;t impressed with the term <em>podcast</em> for one reason or another. From what I&#39;ve been able to gather, these are the most common reasons why (feel free to post a comment below to add to the list):</p>
<dl>
<dt style="font-weight:bold">Techy reasons</dt>
<dd>
<ul style="margin:0px; padding:0px;">
<li>It implies you need an Apple iPod to listen to them</li>
<li>They’re not <em>&quot;casting&quot;</em> because XML is a client <em>pull</em> system, not a server <em>push</em> system!</li>
<li>You can’t immediately figure out what it is when hearing the term the first time</li>
<li>It’s a techy, short sighted term with no longevity</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt style="font-weight:bold;">The &quot;don’t want to be associated with these&quot; reasons</dt>
<dd>
<ul style="margin:0px; padding:0px;">
<li>It describes horrible shows like Dawn and Drew</li>
<li>Podcasts have become too commercial</li>
<li><strong>Antonym to above</strong>: podcasts are amateur and silly, nobody takes them seriously and therefore they have no business potential</li>
<li>The whole field is dominated by a few large egos</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I really don&#39;t agree with some of these points, and I&#39;m honestly apathetic with regards to most of the others, I&#39;m just playing devil&#39;s advocate here.</p>

<p>In response to this, a veritable splattering of adhoc words combined to create podcast-free alternative names have been created:</p>
<ul>
<li>Frank Edward Nora coined the term <a href="http://newtimeradio.com/">New Time Radio</a> even before podcasting took off and he continues to use it as an alternative</li>
<li>Jimbob Kloss from Whole Wheat Radio refers to them as <a href="http://www.wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Audio_magazines">audio magazines</a>, very catchy!</li>
<li>Leo Laporte infamously decided to refer to them as <a href="http://twit.tv/2006/09/22/a_cast_by_any_other_name">netcasts</a>, which other than the iPod mixup really doen’t solve any of the tech issues at all!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m sure a quick Google search would reveal even more such terms.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the <a href="//rubenerd.comshow.com/">Rubenerd Show</a>. I&#39;ve decided I&#39;m going to distance myself from this issue once and for all by calling these shows <em>exactly what they are</em>:</p>
<div style="font-size:30px; padding:10px 0; text-align:center;">INTERNET RADIO SHOWS</div>
<p>That said, I&#39;ll probably keep using the term <em>podcast</em> interchangably with it though, it&#39;s the accepted term that everyone seems to have settled on and agreed to, and I&#39;m fed up with explaining other new terms to people. Perhaps with time the accepted term will change, in which case I&#39;ll change too. After all, language is an evolving beast that changes as we do, right?</p>
