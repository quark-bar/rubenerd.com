<p>Check out this advertisement that I saw on a website in March! 579 Singapore Dollars is a pretty good deal!</p>

<p>Wait a minute, it&#39;s <em>US Dollars</em>. They could tell I had a Singaporean IP address so they thought they&#39;d do some misleading advertising?</p>
<p>Wait a minute, it&#39;s a Dell.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, it&#39;s a <em>Vostro</em>! I reiterate <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenerd/statuses/609324022">from my Twitter post in January</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Which marketing genius came up with the name &#8220;Dell Vostro&#8221;? Sounds like a disease of the brainstem.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Never mind, I don&#39;t want it for 579 Singapore Dollars. Or US Dollars. Or whatever the currency is. I need a cup of coffee!</p>
