<p>One of my interests aside from computing is studying architecture and ocean liners from the early decades of the 20th century. I don&#39;t know why, but I find Art Deco and Neo Gothic design fascinating, and the concept of the &quot;ocean liner&quot; which has literally all but dissapeared in the age of jet airliners and Star Trek inspired teleportation (uh, yeah!). More than you needed to know I&#39;m sure!</p>
<p>Anyway from a break from programming somehow I got onto the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/qm2-schem.htm">Global Security Organisation</a> website which has detailed listings of registard tonnage and ships of different countries, including a graphical comparison of Cunard&#39;s latest flagship <em>RMS Queen Mary 2</em> with the Titanic which everyone knows about. I knew this ship was big, but I had no idea she was <em>that</em> large!</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing that the waterline level is roughly even on each of them too. I wouldn&#39;t have thought the use of stabalisers and being made of lighter and stronger materials would be enough too keep that huge thing upright!</p>
