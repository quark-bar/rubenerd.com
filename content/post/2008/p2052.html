<p>When I wake up in the morning… love<br />
and the sun light hurts my eyes</p>
<p>And something without warning… love<br />
bears heavy on my mind.<br />
Then I look at you<br />
and the world’s alright with me</p>
<p>Just one look at you and I know it’s gonna be…</p>
<p>A lovely daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay<br />
A lovely daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay</p>
<p>When the day that lies ahead of me,<br />
seems impossible to face<br />
And someone else instead of me,<br />
always seems to know the way<br />
Then I look at you,<br />
and the world’s alright with me</p>
<p>Just one look at you and I know it’s gonna be…</p>
<p>A lovely daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay<br />
A lovely daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay</p>
<p>When the day that lies ahead of me,<br />
seems impossible to face</p>
<p>A lovely daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay<br />
A lovely daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay
</p></blockquote>
<p>And people say I&#39;m weird. Sheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh.</p>
