<p>For my university studies and to keep up to date with what&#39;s happening in the Linux world (given I&#39;m a <a href="http://freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> guy mostly) I decided to dual boot my new desktop machine with <a href="http://debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 Etch</a>. In the past I&#39;d always used <a href="http://slackware.com/">Slackware</a> to fill this role, but I figured I&#39;d just try something new.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> &quot;Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 Etch&quot; just doesnâ€™t roll off the tongue as well as &quot;Slackware Linux 12&quot; or &quot;FreeBSD 7.0 Release&quot;. A ridiculously pointless observation, but one that I believe deserves recognition. And it would look just fab printed on a shirt.</p></blockquote>
<p>Within a few minutes of starting the initial install, I got the following error:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/2342122931/" title="Debian Etch failure by rubenerd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2282/2342122931_5faca6bb80.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Debian Etch failure" /></a></p>
<p>No common CD-ROM drive was detected? Are they serious?</p>
<p>Using the exact same optical drive I&#39;ve been able to install the latest versions of FreeBSD, <a href="http://netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a>, <a href="http://openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> and Slackware Linux, not to mention a creaky old version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2000">Windows 2000</a> and even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2#The_.22Warp.22_years">IBM OS/2 Warp</a>! And yet Debian GNU/Linux cannot even detect the drive after the initial boot phase?</p>
<p>I took it to be a sign to keep using Slackware for my Linux partitions. It&#39;s a shame, I was looking forward to seeing why people seem to love <code>apt-get</code> so much; I guess it&#39;s back to my FreeBSD desktop with the ports collection, and Slackware Linux with <a href="http://pkgsrc.se/">pkgsrc</a>. Not that I&#39;m complaining, it&#39;s still my favourite distribution!</p>
