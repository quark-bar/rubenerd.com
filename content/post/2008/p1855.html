<cite>Phone reception in canola fields isn&#39;t as good as you would expect.</cite></p>
<p>On a more serious note this evening folks. Now that my mum has moved on, I feel as though my primary motivation to succeed in studies and work &#8211; to care for her and give her everything she deserved &#8211; is gone too. She never hurt anyone, was such a nice person, and deserved so much more. I know it sound cheesy, but it was the most powerful motivation to succeed in the world.</p>
<p>Now that a year has almost past, I feel as though my progress in life is slowing down and I have little to no purpose or direction whatsoever. I&#39;m studying and working, but what for? I&#39;m terrified of my dreams, and my idle thoughts. I&#39;m an introvert, and society tells me that&#39;s not a good thing. I&#39;m not another lame emo person, I&#39;m just scared of where I am now, and where I&#39;m going, and am questioning my relevance on this planet. I don&#39;t know how else to explain it, but I&#39;m sure others understand.</p>
<p>I know most people didn&#39;t live their childhoods by looking after and out for a parent instead of the other way around, so I know it is possible to have a sense of worth and importance without it, and it&#39;s certainly not a conscious decision on my own part to think little of my abilities and purpose, but it still doesn&#39;t change the fact that I do.</p>
<p>Is it possible to have a midlife crisis when you&#39;re 22?</p>
