<cite>The best CNET blog you may or may not be reading</cite></p>
<p>Given I&#39;ve been unabashedly brown nosing and sucking up to tech writers of late, I figure doing it again won&#39;t sink me any further. Besides, talking about interesting people in a positive way is such a refreshing thing to do after sadly discussing all the nonsense going on around the world right now. I could get used to doing this!</p>
<p>I am well and truly addicted to a ton of <a href="http://news.cnet.com/">CNET News</a> and <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/">ZDNet Australia</a> material; I am subscribed to no less than 12 of their feeds. The real gems aren&#39;t in their general homepage feeds though, but rather in the individual feeds of some of their writers, some of which I hope to talk about more in the future.</p>
<p>My favourite CNET writer by far though is <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8300-13556_3-61.html?authorId=9787475">Gordon Haff</a> who writes the <a style="font-weight:bold" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13556_3-10113230-61.html">Pervasive Datacenter</a> blog, buried an unceremonious 32 links down on CNET&#39;s <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8302-13503_3-0.html">News and Tech Blogs page</a>. He discusses enterprise systems as well as free and open source software on the desktop and server, alongside some well thought out opinion pieces and some general how-tos he&#39;s picked up (in other words, the exact material I&#39;d be talking about right here on my blog if I stayed focused rather than deviating into an assortment of other topics all the time!).</p>
<p>If you have a feed reader set up and ready to go, you can <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8300-13556_3-61.xml">subscribe to his RSS feed here</a>. He&#39;s also provided links for <a href="http://www.google.com/ig/add?feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.cnet.com%2F8300-13556_3-61.xml">Google Reader</a> and <a href="http://add.my.yahoo.com/rss?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.cnet.com%2F8300-13556_3-61.xml">My Yahoo!</a>.</p>
