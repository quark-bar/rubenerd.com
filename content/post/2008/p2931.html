<p>For those of us who were disappointed that the <a href="http://efa.org.au">Electronic Frontiers Australia</a> chairman <a href="http://defendingscoundrels.com/">Dale Clapperton&#39;s</a> recent <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/p2511/">breakfast television appearance</a> was valuable but too short, yesterday he appeared on <a href="http://www.triplem.com.au/brisbane/shows/thespoonman/">The Spoonman on Triple M</a> and was able to go into much more detail and discuss the real dangers of the federal government&#39;s plan to filter and censor the internet, especially poignant given our recent salute to those who died protecting freedoms on <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/p2808/">Remembrance Day</a>.</p>
<p>Candidly, we really need someone like Dale in charge of communications and the internet in this country and not Senator Conroy.</p>
<p>There&#39;s an <strong><a href="http://blog.nocleanfeed.com/2008/11/mmms-spoonman-on-filtering.html">audio link to the show on the latest post</a></strong> of the No Internet Censorship for Australia blog.  The transcript of part one of the show with Dale Clapperton is available from <strong><a href="http://viv.id.au/blog/?p=2580">Hoyden About Town</a></strong>.</p>
