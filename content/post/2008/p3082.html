<p>Given it&#39;s just another manic Monday over here (and in short order in the rest of the world) I figured I&#39;d post another 10 Rubenerd Fun Facts to help us all get through it a little easier. As I&#39;ve mentioned previously, all these facts are irrefutable and 110% true.</p>
<p>If you missed them, feel free to refer to the <a href="//rubenerd.com/p2978/">first Rubenerd Fun Facts post</a> and my post where I ecstatically reported my purchase of <a href="//rubenerd.com/p2962/">David Letterman&#39;s Late Show Fun Facts</a> book. And as usual, feel free to take notes.</p>
