<p>Our phone line at our house in Adelaide is getting the phone line connected on Monday, and ADSL connected the day after, assuming all goes well. I won&#39;t have to live for the half an hour or so a day I can use the internet at WiFi hotspots. It&#39;s going to be tough getting used to slow, &quot;capped&quot; internet plans that cost a fortune again though, unlimited downloads in Singapore have really spoilt me.</p>
<p>And because I dislike dry posts that don&#39;t contain any images, for your convenience I have enclosed a photograph of an off-road wheel chair. I&#39;m hoping <a href="http://www.ikea.com.au/">IKEA</a> starts stocking the office chair version of these soon, the canister wheels on my old office chair in my room were totaled when I drag-raced that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_959">Porsche 959 Turbo</a> down <a href="http://www.mtloftysummit.com/">Mt Lofty</a>. For what it&#39;s worth, I did manage to come second despite not actually staying on the road for very long. The lack of a steering wheel on my chair gave the 959 an unfair advantage I think, I just used a <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com.au/">broom handle with a rubber stopper</a> on the end of it.</p>

<blockquote><p>For a wheelchair that can go anywhere, look no further than the Tank Chair. This custom off-road chair &#8220;conquers streams, mud, snow, sand, gravel &#8212; allowing you to get back to nature &#8212; and can also climb up and down stairs&#8221;. It features motors built by NPC Robotics.</p></blockquote>
