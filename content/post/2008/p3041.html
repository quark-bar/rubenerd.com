<p>In my previous post (<em><a href="http://rubenerd.com/p3036/">On Adelaide Airport, Embraer E-Jets</a></em>) I almost forgot to mention the best thing about Adelaide Airport, shown above. Internode of course is one of Australia&#39;s largest ISPs and is based right here.</p>
<p>Which leads to the inevitable question: is it sad to have your life completely dependent on a computer network? Is it healthy? Should I be concerned? Should others be concerned? Can you get a brain ethernet implant or something? Perhaps I shouldn&#39;t be asking these questions!</p>
