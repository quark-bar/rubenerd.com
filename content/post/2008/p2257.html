<blockquote><p>At Bernie Lewis home loans, we’re standing by to help, including Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
<p>Because that’s what being available seven days a week, means to us.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, generally a five day working week plus Saturday and Sunday means seven days to us too. I guess it&#39;s just their own way in their advertising of showing that as a real estate finance broker they know their arithmetic. Alienates less people that listing the first three thousand digits of Euler&#39;s number.</p>
<p>What I want to know is, do they claim to be open all month, including the first week? Because that&#39;s what being open four weeks means to me!</p>
