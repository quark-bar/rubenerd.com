<p>I got quite a shock this afternoon when going through my server records. For the month of October 2008 I was getting hundreds of hits from <a href="http://elgato.com/">Elgato.com</a>, but I couldn&#39;t figure out why. As it turns out, <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/p1575/">my review of the Elgato EyeTV</a> digital TV tuner stick was featured on <a href="http://elgato.com/elgato/int/mainmenu/news/media-coverage/media-coverage-archive.en.html">Elgato&#39;s Media Coverage page</a> alongside the likes of the <strong>The Age</strong> (an Australian newspaper), <strong>MacLife</strong>, <strong>MacWorld</strong> and <strong>PC Magazine</strong>!</p>
<p>This could be the highest profile mention of my blog and logo since I linked to it myself (ahem) on Whole Wheat Radio. This has made my weekend :-)</p>
