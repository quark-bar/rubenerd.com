<p>Having received payment for my latest one off project today, I celebrated by going down to Wheelock Place and splurging on a Starbucks Venti <a href="http://www.starbucks.com.sg/promotions/index.html">Dulce de Leche</a> from next door and buying some computer books I&#39;ve been dying to get. I&#39;m a wild guy you see.</p>

<cite>Happiness is a stack of new interesting computer books!</cite></p>
<p>I find that I learn new skills much faster if I&#39;m given examples and real world applications of technologies rather than just the usual &quot;an array is a collection of objects yada yada&quot; theory. The O&#39;Reilly Cookbooks are absolutely fantastic for this, what irritates me is that I only just discovered them recently when I had to learn Python in a hurry for an assignment. I learned more from that one book than many hours sifting through tutorial pages and the dry slides from the uni.</p>

Perhaps a little over my head right now, but we&#39;ll be looking at the Linux kernel at some point so this could be an interesting side study for comparison.</p>
<p>From the blurbs:</p>

<p>And now I&#39;m off to bed. 00:07, that&#39;s pretty early for me!</p>
