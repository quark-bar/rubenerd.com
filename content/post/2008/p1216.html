<p>Before I go any further, I’d like to warn you that this post about using FreeBSD to assign an address to a Western Digital MyBook drive is unnecessarily verbose. See, I could have just as easily said &quot;this post is long&quot;.</p>
<p>Writing about theoretical uses for software is one thing, but figuring out how to apply software to a problem practically, and actually getting it work, is one of the greatest feelings in the world alongside  writing a fantastic piece of software yourself to solve a problem. It makes me feel useful and gives me a rush quite unlike anything else.</p>

<p>Case in point, my sister and I had a problem in our new house in Adelaide. Before I left Singapore, I bought a gigabit ethernet <a href="http://www.westerndigital.com/en/products/products.asp?driveid=347">Western Digital MyBook 1GB World Edition</a> NAS drive and loaded it up with all our media: movies, shows, music, podcasts, BSD disk images, ebooks. By using a simple network drive, we spared ourselves having to bring a separate computer down with us.</p>
<p>Our makeshift home network consists of each of our laptops and the aformentioned network drive which are all connected through short Cat-6 ethernet cables to a <a href="http://www.dlink.com.au/products.aspx?sec=1&#038;sub1=14&#038;sub2=24&#038;pid=139">5 port gigabit Ethernet switch</a>. To compensate for the lack of a router, I assigned my sister’s MacBook and my MacBook Pro static IP addresses and I knew the network drive could also be assigned one. Very cool.</p>

<p>Now here’s the kicker: for some reason in their infinite wisdom Western Digital decided not to ship the MyBook with a default IP address. This means it <strong>requires</strong> a DHCP server (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCP">Wikipedia link</a>) to initally provide it with an address. I realised that without a router with a built in DHCP server, this network drive wouldn’t get an address, and therefore there’d be no way for me to log into it to assign it a static IP! Catch 22, chicken and the egg, a Bruce Schneier fact, call it what you will.</p>
<p>So within a few minutes I had configured a home network with two laptops and an inaccessible, address-less network drive. It seemed not having a router with a built in DHCP server would make this setup impossible. A quick Perl script determined that indeed only the two laptops were in our subdomain range:</p>
<pre>#!/usr/bin/env perl -w

for ($i = 1; $i &lt; 255; $i++) {
  system "ping -a -c 2 192.168.1.$i";
}

print &quot;Western Digital engineers love DHCP it seemsn&quot;
</pre>
<p>At this point I had to make a tough decision. To access our media network drive I could either be patient and wait a week until we got our new broadband modem with a built in router, or I could be impatient. Grilled cheese sandwich. Grilled cheese sandwich?</p>
<p>I decided to do the latter and give it what it wanted: a DHCP server! In place of a router, I would configure a one-time use FreeBSD virtual machine with a software DHCP server which would assign the address to the network drive, so I could log into it remotely and assign it a static IP.</p>

<p>After setting up a generic VMware Fusion virtual machine on my MacBook Pro, I mounted a FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE ISO I had on already had on my hard drive and installed it with all the default options. I skipped configuring everything in the system installer except than the network card. I declined to use DHCP when it asked, and assigned it a static IP.</p>
<p>After rebooting the VM, I logged in as root and installed the <code><a href="http://freshports.org/net/isc-dhcp3-server/">isc-dhcp3-server</a></code> package from ports.</p>
<p> I didn’t bother adding anything fancy to the <code>/usr/local/etc/dhcpd.conf</code> other than defining the pool of addresses and required options:</p>
<pre>option domain-name "chuckpeddle";
option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;

default-lease-time 3600;
max-lease-time 86400;
ddns-update-style none;

subnet 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
  range 192.168.1.120 192.168.1.129;
}</pre>
<p>Next, to check what addresses our makeshift DHCP server has assigned, I created the default <code>dhcpd.leases</code> file:</p>
<pre># touch /var/db/dhcpd.leases</pre>
<p>Finally, I enabled the dhcpd daemon in <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> and told it what card I wanted FreeBSD to listen for DHCP requests on. On VMware Fusion 1.1.3, the network card in FreeBSD is <code>le0</code>, but you can always check to make sure by using <code>ifconfig -a</code></p>
<pre>
dhcpd_enable="YES"
dhcpd_ifaces="le0"
</pre>
<p>The moment of truth had arrived! I turned off my Western Digital MyBook NAS drive, rebooted the FreeBSD virtual machine, then turned the network drive back on again. After a minute of waiting, <strong>sure enough</strong> the <code>/var/db/dhcpd.leases</code> file reported that it had assigned an address…</p>
<pre>lease 192.168.1.129 {
  starts 6 2008/08/02 14:37:12;
  ends 6 2008/08/02 15:37:12;
  binding state active;
  next binding state free;
  […]
  client-hostname "RubenerdNAS";
}</pre>
<p>… and automagically the Finder on my MacBook Pro reported it had found a new samba share (with it’s irreverent sense of humour)! My network drive had been resurrected from the dead!</p>

<p>Finally, after all of that I was able to go to my web browser and log into the damned network drive’s configuration page and change the IP address to a static one.</p>
<p>I still can’t help but wonder why Western Digital decided not to include a default address.</p>

<p>And now if you’d excuse me, I’m off to watch an episode of <a href="http://crankygeeks.com/">Cranky Geeks</a>. From my network drive. PHEW!</p>
