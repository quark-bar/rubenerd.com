<p>In one of the recent <a href="http://www.wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Audio_magazines">audio magazines</a> over on Whole Wheat Radio I heard Jimbob discussing how he didn&#39;t know why people use <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>, <a href="http://digg.com/">Digg</a> or other popularity link sharing sites because when he wants to let people see what he&#39;s reading all he has to do is add the site to his Google Shared weblog thingy.</p>
<p>I totally agree with what he says about popularity based link and news sites. I really dislike Digg, reddit, Chuck Norris News and the like for reasons I could spend a whole week explaining. It could be because I&#39;m a proud <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> guy and have used them as one of my main news sources for a long time ;).</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> Perhaps I distrust popularity-based sites because I never was popular myself. I may have just discovered something here!</p>
<p>I also just noticed that this weblog entry has the internal id of <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1111/">1111</a>. I could have created another useless Rubenerd Blog milestone post, but I chose not to. Aren’t you relieved?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.delicious.panes.png"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.delicious.panes.thumb.png" alt="So many links, so little time…" style="height:315px; width:500px" /></a><br />
<cite>So many links, so little time…</cite></p>
<p>For this reason, I don&#39;t use del.icio.us as a silly &quot;site ranking&quot; or &quot;social standing&quot; system, but merely as a simple online bookmark repository, which for my needs has advantages over using the little Bookmarks menu in my browser:</p>
<ul>
<li>All my bookmarks are in the same place and are easier to manage</li>
<li>Every computer I use has the same bookmarks, so no worries over syncronising multiple lists</li>
<li>Works as an online backup system for links that survives for years</li>
<li>The ability to export my links as an OPML file and import them into another site or even back into my browser in the future if I decide to switch</li>
<li><em>And on the side</em>, I can show people sites that I find interesting and useful</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, there are advantages to using a Bloglines Blog or Google Reader&#39;s Shared Items features to show people what you&#39;re reading when said material is in the form of a weblog, podcast or other RSS or Atom syndicated material, but for one-off web pages that you just want to keep for later del.icio.us fits the bill quite nicely.</p>
