<p>I can recite the names of over a dozen American presidential candidates. Not because I&#39;m that interested in American politics, but because <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenerd/">I&#39;ve been added by them on Twitter</a> more times than I can count!</p>
<p>Political jokes aside, I&#39;ve been added now by so many Twitter bots, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one. The thing that bugs me most about it though is the fact this is happening despite the location parameter that&#39;s on my profile: I&#39;ve said I&#39;m in <strong>Singapore</strong>! How hard would it be for a person writing these bots to push their favoured political candidates to ignore people who aren&#39;t living in the United States? Unless they just don&#39;t care and are just using the shotgun approach. Insert witty pun joke about gun control here.</p>

<cite>Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in Sydney attempting to bring up with George W. Bush the issue of American presidential candidates spamming Australians on Twitter, with seemingly little success.</cite></p>
<p>Now that I&#39;m using <a href="http://twhirl.com/">Twhirl</a> as my desktop Twitter aggregator on my Mac (which shows private messages) I&#39;m thinking of just creating a smart email folder that any Twitter messages get marked as read and filtered into. When I have to sort through thirty or so messages a day from Mark Huckabee, Ron Paul, John McCain and Chris Dodd I think it&#39;s stopped being funny.</p>
<p>Actually nah, it&#39;s still pretty funny :).</p>
