<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/china.google.png" style="height:480px; width:253px; float:right; margin: 0 0 10px 20px" alt="" /> My fabulous father is currently on assignment at a few plants in China, and I got an email from him this morning. From a local cafe he&#39;s currently able to access all the stuff hosted on the <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">Rubenerd Show</a> domain (including the blog you&#39;re reading now) as well as my <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenerd">Twitter feed</a>.</p>
<p>In a way I&#39;m relieved, but in a way I&#39;m disappointed. Obviously they don&#39;t consider me enough of a threat to their Great Firewall nor to their squeaky clean media. I&#39;m obviously not doing as much as I thought!</p>
<p>On the whole my dad really likes mainland China and the Chinese people, not to mention their food (I&#39;m jealous!) but as I think most of us do he has some real issues with their government. It&#39;s a shame when pundits label an entire race of people evil when it&#39;s just their government they disagree with. Perhaps I think this way because I&#39;ve lived outside my country of birth for so long and get to see Asian opinions of Australia and the West from the outside myself… we&#39;re not exactly angels ourselves in many ways!</p>
<p>And herein ends my potentially sensitive post!</p>
