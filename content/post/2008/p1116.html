<p>On <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1108/">April fools day</a> I had noticed many people on Twitter were saying how they hated news stores and blog posts that were blatantly fabricated in a vein attempt to be funny. As I never like to irritate people,  especially with fake blog entries, I tried my hand at posting a <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1108/">fake blog entry review of Windows Vista</a>. Dave Wares and Sharon in Singapore saw right through me, but I did get one serious post!</p>
<p>Anyway to make amends and restitution for that post that made me feel downright ill after reading, I thought I&#39;d post a screenshot and a brief summary of the only remaining Windows version and machine that I do actually still use: <strong><em>Windows 2000 Professional</em></strong> in a <a href="//rubenerd.com/just-bought-vmware-fusion/">virtual machine on my MacBook Pro!</a></p>
<p><a href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.w2k.vm.png"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.w2k.vm.thumb.png" alt="Windows 2000 Professional with SP4 and RU1 in a VMware Fusion virtual machine on OS X Leopard" style="height:340px; width:500px" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately as resilient as the <a href="http://winehq.org/">Wine compatibility layer</a> is becoming, there are some Windows applications that just don&#39;t like being run on anything other than Windows. Surprisinly a lot of this stuff I get comes from my uni (argh), sometimes they&#39;re small utilities that only run on Windowsâ€¦ and then there&#39;s Solitaire.</p>
<p>The advantage of running Windows 2000 instead of XP (or heaven forbid the Vista trainwreck!) in a virtual machine is that you can reserve a tiny sliver of RAM for it and only 1 CPU core and it will still perform very, very well. This is especially useful when you&#39;re on a laptop: running XP or Vista alongside Mac OS X on battery power is not very fun or pratical!</p>
<p>Another consideration with Windows that makes 2000 useful is the commonly known fact that <a href="http://discuss.fogcreek.com/joelonsoftware/default.asp?cmd=show&#038;ixPost=153877">Windows installations degrade in performance over time</a> to the point where it&#39;s just better to reformat your machine and reinstall Windows. With a Windows 2000 virtual machine file, the entire operating system is contained in a disk image thats only a few hundred megabytes. Compared to 1 or 2 gigabytes for Windows XP or the ridiculously bloated size of a Windows Vista install, it means it&#39;s a cinch to backup a fresh install of 2000 and restore it whenever you want.</p>

<cite>Even Windows2000-tan admits Firefox-tan is better!</cite></p>
<p>As someone who grew up using various flavours of Windows from 3.x to XP before I made the final switch to Mac OS X, FreeBSD and Linux, I say without reserve that the Windows 2000 interface <strong>is still the best that Microsoft came up with</strong>. Luna on Windows XP looked childish and the Vista interface can cause serious eye damage for a laundry list of reasons.</p>
<p>And the final reason why Windows 2000 is more bearable than XP or Vista? No product activation! That&#39;s right, as a legitimate licence holder I&#39;m not treated like a criminal every time I have to restore an image! It&#39;s so refreshing!</p>
<p>In my next post I&#39;ll be listing some of the software I use to make Windows 2000 more bearable and feel more like a real OS, such virtual desktops, snapping windows, SSH clients and whatnot, if you&#39;re forced to use a flavour of Windows at some point.</p>
