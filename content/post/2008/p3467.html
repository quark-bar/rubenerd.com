<p>It is a stunningly gorgeous afternoon here in Mawson Lakes in Adelaide, Australia. I do admit sheepishly to liking overcast days but even I can appreciate the beauty of a blue sky with a few cirrus clouds and a warm but not hot 24 degrees (75 Fahrenheit) At the risk of sounding even more cheesy than I already have done here, I&#39;ve been walking around the shops and the park just for the sake of being out in this weather. I&#39;m sitting at the <a href="http://www.theboatdeck.com.au/">Boatdeck Cafe</a> across from the lake now having a coffee and looking out the window, iPhone in hand of course.</p>
<p>While we&#39;re on the subject, perhaps one of the things I like the most about Singapore is the weather; I know there are tons of horror stories about how stinking hot it is over there and how humid it is, but its the kind of place where you only need one wardrobe, where you don&#39;t ever shivver (unless your in frigid air conditioning!), where you can hop out of bed and have a shower without being scared of leaving a warm bed for the cold, where you can comfortably go for evening and late night walks and still wear light clothes. I guess I was acclimatised to such weather having lived there my whole life, but there you go.</p>
<p>I started this post with the intention of talking about living problems, but as usual a digression on my part morphed into two gigantic paragraphs. And as usual, I&#39;m thinking of leaving it at that because my digression was more interesting than what I was going to talk about anyway.</p>
<p>Singapore and Australia are two of the most beautiful places on Earth, and I&#39;m so pleased I&#39;m spending my life living there. Now I just need some sort of wormhole between Singapore and Perth and Adelaide built I&#39;ll be happy.</p>

<p>If you galactic construction workers are listening, my dad would also like some other wormholes connecting Singapore to Ubud (the art, food and cultural precinct of Bali) and Singapore to Canada as well. He loves Montreal and Toronto, but would also like a wormhole directly to one of their national parks.</p>
<p>This would work wonders for me of course because then I could get an exit aperture somewhere along the said wormhole from Singapore to Canada that drops me off in Seoul/Incheon, then Kyoto, and further along to Talkeetna and to Denali. My dad wouldn&#39;t be able to exit the last two apertures because he&#39;s flagged on a US warning list now for his business trips to Iran, but that&#39;s the beauty of the wormhole system: he wouldn&#39;t need to! Not too hard to implement right? Genius!</p>
<p>I&#39;m in a good mood today and thinking positively about the world, only happens when I wake up around 5% of the time, so I&#39;m going to take advantage of it! That&#39;s right I&#39;m getting up from this table to order an Ã©clair. Sometimes I&#39;m so wild and unpredictable I scare even myself!</p>
