<p>For those who don&#39;t use <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, the online microblog and simple social networking site, whenever someone starts following your messages because they think you&#39;re interesting, you receive an email from Twitter letting you know. Checking who <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenerd/">my new </a><a href="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd/followers">followers</a> are has become an unexpectedly happy part of my generally dull morning routine.</p>
<p>Despite my love for Twitter, one feature has been missing the entire time: a notification when a person breaks off and stops following you; arguably I think these notifications would be even more interesting to watch simply so that I could establish my own <em>&quot;revulsion&quot;</em> rate as it were!</p>
<p>Enter <a href="http://useqwitter.com/">Qwitter</a>. Once you&#39;ve signed up to their service they notify you whenever a person loses interest in you and stops following your messages.</p>
<p>For example, since signing up I&#39;ve been notified that <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/mariancall/">Marian Call</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/shaunmartin/">Shaun Martin</a></strong> have stopped following me. I&#39;m still following you guys if you change your mindsâ€¦ :-(</p>
<p><strong>2008.10.22 UPDATE</strong>: <a href="http://twitter.com/jotoole4">Jotoole4</a> is no longer following me on Twitter either.</p>
