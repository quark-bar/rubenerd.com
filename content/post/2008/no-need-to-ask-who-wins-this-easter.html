<p><em>Pun intended of course!</em> I always look forward to important days of the year for two principal reasons: we get days off work and studies, and the major web portals and search engines put up decorations. Come on, admit it, you feel the exact same way.</p>

<p>This year, <a href="http://ask.com/">Ask.com</a> definitely has the best Easter decorations for a search engine. Very cute.</p>
<p>On a sadder note, this was the first Easter holiday I had without my mum around; I get the feeling I&#39;ll be framing a lot of celebrations this year with that mentality. At least it gets me a break from people who say you can&#39;t be an Atheist and celebrate religious holidays in a secular way :-).</p>
