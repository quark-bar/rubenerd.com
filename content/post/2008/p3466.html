<cite>Rest in peace.</cite></p>
<p>This afternoon my sister accidently knocked one of my 1TB external hard drives onto the hard concrete floor of our temporary house here in Adelaide (the drive I <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1216/">talked about in a post back in August</a>). The drive is making some very scary noises and none of the indicator lights are working. I&#39;m ready to call this a write off. Absolute catastrophic disaster.</p>
<p>I have backups of all the data except for some raw audio files for some of the latest Rubenerd Shows, which means I can&#39;t go back and recompress them at higher bitrates at a later date. For what it&#39;s worth, if she had knocked any of my drives onto the floor, I am somewhat relieved that it was this one.</p>
<p>One of my concerns is how I&#39;m going to afford to urgently buy a new one so I can have backups of my other drives again. Say if Murphy&#39;s Law was to take effect and one of my other drives were to fail between now and when I get a replacement for this drive, I would lose months and months of work and study material. It would be catastrophic.</p>
<p>The other concern is that I do have backups of all this stuff, but the backups are in ultra compressed <a href="//rubenerd.com/rzip-is-absolutely-incredible/">Rzip format</a> to save space. The problem is, I don&#39;t have enough drive space amongst my other external hard drives or internally in this laptop to decompress them, at least I don&#39;t think I do. I have a long night ahead of me frantically rearranging files and deleting things in the hopes I can scrape up enough space to decompress these files.</p>
<p>I&#39;m giving some serious consideration to buying a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc_recordable">Blu Ray burner</a> to backup static data, then using hard drives as regular backups. Blu Ray discs are far too clumsy and slow to use for day-to-day operations, but they might be invaluable for archival of material such as old Rubenerd Shows or camcorder videos. Having this data backed up on hard drives is a bit silly if I&#39;m not changing them.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll also be rearranging my stuff on this table and stringing the cables off hooks underneath so that this kind of accident can&#39;t happen again.</p>
<p>So much for my <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1216/">really good mood I had</a> less than a few hours ago. :&#39;-(</p>
