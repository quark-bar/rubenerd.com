<p>If you&#39;re like any reasonable person who&#39;s genuinely scared of the idea of Microsoft purchasing Yahoo, show everyone your position <strong><a href="http://www.cafepress.com/boo_hoo">by buying some Boohoo paraphernalia</a></strong>!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cafepress.com/boo_hoo"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/boohoo.shirt.jpg" alt="Boohoo shirt!" style="height:240px; width:240px" /></a></p>
<p>If I actually had some spare cash <a href="//rubenerd.com/on-low-profile-pci-cards-and-microsoft-tax/">after buying a new motherboard</a> which <a href="//rubenerd.com/faulty-intel-dq35jo-motherboard-fun/">ended up being faulty anyway</a> I&#39;d grab myself a <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/boo_hoo.224966080">mug</a> and a <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/boo_hoo.224960176">golf shirt</a>. If I didn&#39;t buy the golf shirt, I&#39;d probably have enough money to play a round of golf. Hah, not in Singapore! And if I didn&#39;t buy the mug, I&#39;d probably have enough money for a Starbucks Caramel Macchiato. In Singapore. I just realised the photo I uploaded was the white shirt, not the polo shirt. Wait, golf  shirt. Now I&#39;m confused. Boohoo! Don&#39;t you hate paragraphs full of disjointed sentences? I do. Boohoo!</p>
