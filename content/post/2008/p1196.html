<p>Mindlessly navigating the intertubes this evening to try to bring myself out of a deep blue funk, I came across an interesting front page news story on CNET&#39;s always aptly named <a href="http://news.cnet.com/">News.com</a> site:</p>
<p><a href="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/screenie.cnetnews.macbroken.png"><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/screenie.cnetnews.macbroken.thumb.png" alt="CNET News.com showing story on the Mac Classic" style="height:327px; width:520px" /></a></p>
<p>Clicking on it as of 22:18 Singapore Standard Time though returns a classic 404 &quot;The page you&#39;ve requested cannot be found.&quot; error.</p>
<p><a href="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/screenie.cnetnews.macbroken2.png"><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/screenie.cnetnews.macbroken2.thumb.png" alt="CNET News.com showing story on the Mac Classic" style="height:327px; width:520px" /></a></p>
<p>Is this error just the result of a small slip up by one of the CNET employees, or is this a gentle ironic snub against the Macintosh computer?</p>
<p>Either this is some sort of a conspiracy, or it&#39;s some sort of conspiracy. I&#39;m also entertaining the notion as a secondary idea that in fact this is not what it appears, but is in fact some sort of conspiracy.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The light grey text underneath the Mac story reporting the time since it was posted is now saying <strong>3 hours, 34 minutes</strong> with no change. Damn it, I want to see the inside of the Mac Classic!</p>
<p>Iâ€™m beginning to entertain the notion that this is some sort of conspiracy.</p></blockquote>
