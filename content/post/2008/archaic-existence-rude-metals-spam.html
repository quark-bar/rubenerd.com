<cite>Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam…</cite></p>
<p>For a long time in this weblog&#39;s formative years <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/media/spam/">I used to post</a> some of the more funny, interesting or ridiculous spam messages I got either here, in email or from carrier pigeons shoved through my window. I figured I was getting all this material all the time, why not use it for something?</p>
<p>Anyway after an extended period of time where I received nothing but the usual penis enlarging advice, fake watches and bogus lotteries, I received a real gem (pun intended) in my comment moderation queue. It&#39;s… <strong>1703</strong> words long!</p>
<p>If I posted the entire message it would easily triple the length of this page (and it&#39;s already long enough as it is) so just to give you an idea here&#39;s a <em>brief</em> snippet:</p>
<blockquote><p>

<p>Obviously by padding their spam URLs with natural language, they&#39;re attempting to bypass spam filters. Still, I didn&#39;t know that <em>metals were toughened by rude peoples</em>. Is that anything like Rude… box?</p>

<p>If it is, I&#39;d rather not have anything to do with it!</p>
