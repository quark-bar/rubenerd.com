<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> The <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Whole Wheat Radio wiki</a> is back online again.</p></blockquote>

<p>With the <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1147/">Whole Wheat Radio outage</a> in effect I decided to create some mockup pages outlining some ideas over on my university intranet&#39;s [sic] MediaWiki installation, but after some vocal opposition I decided to whip up a temporary WWR wiki testbed over at <a href="//rubenerd.com/projects/wwr">//rubenerd.com/projects/wwr</a>. Feel free to mess around there with WWR related whatnot while the <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">mothership</a> is offline and you have a Sunday morning to kill as I do right now!</p>
<p>If you&#39;re using a wiki under similar circumstances and you don&#39;t need or want anonymous edits compared to a bigger, more collaborative effort like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">Wikipedia</a>, all it takes is appending one line to your <code>./LocalSettings.php</code> file:</p>
<pre>
# Block edits by anonymous users
$wgGroupPermissions['*']['edit'] = false;
</pre>
<p>I know, I know… that was actually TWO lines, but the point is only the last line actually invokes the functionality described, the first is just a comment… which you should always include. Okay, okay I see your point.</p>
