<p>What ever happened to the different images that Dave Winer would put on the top of <em>Scripting News</em> each year? Check out his <a href="http://www.scripting.com/2004/01.html">archive for 2004</a> for example, then look at his <a href="http://scripting.com">current site</a>. It looked so much better before!</p>
