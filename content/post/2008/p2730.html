<cite>Spaces in action on my (non-brick!) MacBook Pro</cite></p>
<p>Given I&#39;m also a desktop FreeBSD user, one of the features I was desperately anxious to use with Mac OS X Leopard was the &quot;Spaces&quot; tool. As with virtual desktops on Unix-like workstations, when you enable Spaces you get access to a slew of virtual desktops which gives you much more screen real estate on the same display which is especially useful for laptops. Suffice to say, I cannot live without it!</p>
<p>As is typical with Apple software though, when they implemented this common feature (well, common on everything except Windows!) they included a few other useful features that set it apart from the competition. What&#39;s curious though is that Spaces isn&#39;t enabled at all by default on new Leopard installations, and I know several recent converts who didn&#39;t even know it existed. Perhaps Apple assume this feature is for more advanced users, which is a shame because I think it actually makes multitasking computers much easier to use.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/icon.spaces.png" alt="Spaces icon" style="height:256px; width:256px;" /></p>
<p>To enable spaces you want to open <em>System Preferences</em> on the Apple menu, click the <em>Expose &amp; Spaces</em> icon under <em>Personal</em>, click the <em>Spaces</em> tab and check <em>Enable Spaces</em>. Once you&#39;ve done this, a spaces icon will appear on your menubar and you&#39;re ready to go.</p>
<p>While the menubar icon is a useful way to change desktops, it is much clumsier than using dedicated keyboard shortcuts, so the first thing I always do is change the <em>To Switch Between Spaces</em> list box option to <em>^ Arrow Keys</em> so you can cycle through them by just pressing <code>[Ctrl]</code> and <code>[&#x2192;/&#x2190;]</code> for example.</p>

<cite>Assigning applications to their own spaces</cite></p>
<p>The above commands are the ones most people use, and are similar to what is available with the virtual desktops on Unix-like workstations. What makes Apple&#39;s implementation infinitely sweeter though is the ability to assign applications you generally have open all the time to their own &quot;space&quot; by default. This means when you open your commonly used application such as iTunes or a Twitter client for example, it will automatically open in the space you assigned it, NOT the space you&#39;re currently working in. I find this much easier and smoother than having one desktop and constantly minimising or hiding windows only to bring them back.</p>
<p>For example, I have my virtual desktops, sorry &quot;spaces&quot;, configured so iTunes is always open on space 2, <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a> is always open on space 4, and my stacks of Terminal windows are on Space 3. This means I can have my web browser and Finder windows open on the primary Space 1 which is where much of my work gets done. It&#39;s a fantastic way to multitask; I can&#39;t imagine going back to an OS that has you minimise every window you still want access to but not right at that moment! It&#39;s also a great way to compartmentalise what you do, so you know music related stuff is in one place, Twitter is in another, and so on. There&#39;s no more fumbing around thousands of open windows at once.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/Trashman.jpg" style="height:196px; width:200px; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px;" alt="The Trashmen" /> Once you get the hang of using applications in their own space it becomes second nature, yet I know of very few people who use it at all. If you have Leopard I really encourage you to try using it; it is a HUGE step up from minimising or hiding windows. If you&#39;re unfamiliar, don&#39;t feel as though you don&#39;t have to start with trillions of virtual desktops, heck even just having two makes live so much easier. You can always add more once you become more comfortable using them.</p>
<p>Now if you would exuse me, I&#39;m off to hit <code>[Ctrl]</code> <code>[&#x2192;]</code> to change the currently playing song. I&#39;ve had the <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/rubenerd/library/music/The+Trashmen">Trashmen</a> playing the same three minute song <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/rubenerd/library/music/The+Trashmen">28 times now</a> and it&#39;s getting somewhat repetitive. The bird is the word. The bird bird bird. The bird is the word. Don&#39;t you know about the bird? Everybody knows that the bird is the word!</p>
