<cite>Now would be a great time visit Alaska, because Sarah Palin isn&#39;t there!</cite></p>
<p>Well look at that, it appears among the young voters the stunt was supposed to enthrall and energise in the first place, John McCain&#39;s choice of Sarah Palin as his vice presidential running mate has appeared to have backfired.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,24540023-912,00.html">According to an article on the Adelaide Now website</a> (the online version of our local newspaper), a Harvard University survey of 2400 people aged 18 to 24 found that while 25% claimed the decision would make them more likely to vote for John McCain, a whopping 40% claimed the decision made them less likely. That&#39;s right, for every person who was swayed to vote by the decision, it backfired on two.</p>
<p>By comparison, Barack Obama&#39;s selection of Joe Biden marginally increased support for his ticket.</p>
<p>My generation has been getting a bum rap for a long time now for our disorderly conduct, self centred nature and lack of respect for our eldersâ€¦ you know, all the charges the generation before last labelled our parents with too. It&#39;s good to see that in the sea of silliness that is politics there are some people within my generation&#39;s ranks at least who posses a certain degree of inaccurately-named common sense.</p>
<p>I hate to admit it, but this story gave me a genuine case of schadenfreude! John McCain isn&#39;t exactly a great choice, but Sarah Palin is a joke, plain and simple. And before you say that I&#39;m a joke for saying it, I admit I&#39;m <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/10/13/2388893.htm?section=entertainment">shamelessly copying Salman Rushdie&#39;s description</a>.</p>
