<cite>Don&#39;t hurt me, I have no idea… (I love using this picture for when I&#39;m confused!)</cite></p>
<p>After several false starts and month long delays, I have reset my Google Reader account and am now attempting to figure out how to use it properly. Some random points:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve subscribed to the two dozen sites I’ve regularly read, and have updated my public shared items page. That much I know how to do</li>
<li>The think that is confusing me though is how to add <em>&quot;friends&quot;</em> to Google Reader. On the left hand side there is a link called <em>&quot;Friends’ Shared Items&quot;</em> but it only lets you add people who are using Gmail.</li>
<li>I have subscribed to several people’s shared items in Google Reader, but I’ve been told others can’t access mine because my starred/shared items are <em>&quot;protected&quot;</em>. I can read their notes just fine.</li>
<li>I have added the <em>&quot;Note In Reader&quot;</em> to my browser’s bookmark bar, looks as though you can share any page now not just a story you read in a feed you’re subscribed to.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/09454950261221562208">My shared items can be found here</a>. If you can figure out how to add me as a friend, have at it!</li>
</ul>
<p>My head hurts. I&#39;m going to bed!</p>
