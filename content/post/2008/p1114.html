<p>Big and silly happy birthday wishes going out to my little sister and <a href="//rubenerd.comshow.com/">Rubenerd Show</a> Computer Game Reviewer <a href="http://schade.sg/elke/">Elke Schade</a> who turns 19 today. She&#39;s three years younger than me, and somehow more matureâ€¦ speaking of which I used the most embarrassing photo I could find :-D</p>
<p>She&#39;s not as cool <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1099/">as those of us born in March</a>, but she wasn&#39;t too far off. We can&#39;t all be perfect I guess :-)</p>
