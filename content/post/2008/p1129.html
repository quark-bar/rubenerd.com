<p>One of the more pleasurable things in life is when you can get on your high horse and let the rest of the world know why they&#39;re wrong, and you&#39;re right. Or maybe that only applies to conversations about music. Sorry <a href="http://schade.sg/elke">Elke</a>, comparing <em>Akon</em> to <em>The Rat Pack</em> is like comparing <em>Barry Manilow</em> to <em><a href="http://www.joannehook.com/contents.html">Jo Anne Hook</a></em>. Wait, Jo Anne Hook is a painter. Never mind.</p>
<p>My gripe today is with people who use images in HTML on websites without defining their dimensions! You&#39;ve probably seen pages at one point that seem to rearrange themselves as material moves around to make way for images that are loading. By defining the sizes of images <em>in advance</em>, browsers know how much visual space to allocate them as it draws the page.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Without declared dimensions</dt>
<dd><code>&lt;img src=&quot;image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;description&quot; /&gt;</code></dd>
<dt>Using HTML dimensions</dt>
<dd><code>&lt;img src=&quot;image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;description&quot;<br /> width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;</code></dd>
<dt>Using inline CSS</dt>
<dd><code>&lt;img src=&quot;image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;desccription&quot; <br />style=&quot;width:320px; height:240px;&quot; /&gt;</code></dd>
<dt>Using an external style sheet</dt>
<dd>Same as latter, but using an external style sheet linked with an <code>id</code> statement for individual images, or more pratically using <code>class</code> for many images on a page with the same dimensions.</dd>

<p>Without this information, the browser is forced to render the page as it would look without the image until it has reached it; this is <em>especially</em> noticeable on slower internet connections and on mobile phones. It also does nothing to help the sanity of people who are halfway through reading a paragraph and suddenly have the text disappear as it&#39;s pushed away by an image that has started loading!</p>
<p>As far as I know from my own experience, <a href="http://www.typosphere.org/">Typo</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and <a href="http://mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</a> conveniently specify image sizes <em>automagically</em> on images you upload and insert, and I assume most other content management systems do too… save for <a href="http://www.blosxom.com/">Blosxom</a> of course! Wow Blosxom, the first weblog publishing system I ever used, that brings back memories!</p>
<p>Save the world: specify image dimensions!</p>
