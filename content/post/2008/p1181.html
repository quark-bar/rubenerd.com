<p>Salamat datang ke Rubenerd Blog p1181!</p>
<p>Well here I am back in KL again typing away in at the <a href="http://www.starbucks.com.my">Starbucks</a> in <a href="http://www.suriaklcc.com.my">KLCC</a>. Don&#39;t let my archival Flickr photo above fool you though, it&#39;s been raining the whole time I&#39;ve been here! In the tropics a light shower is a good thing though in my opinion, the clouds block some of the sunlight and make the temperature a bit cooler, especially in the evening after a day of rain.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve met up with a friend of mine for some semi-official business regarding semi-official business and it went surprisingly well, we&#39;ve hammered out some plans. With all the talk about email, then instant messaging, then blog comments, then micro blogging on services such as <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenerd/">Twitter</a>, it&#39;s still so much simpler and faster organising things <em>in person</em>. I always cringe whenever my dad says that the internet is amazing because you could work literally anywhere on Earth now and do a job through it; while I&#39;m sure it&#39;s possible and I know lots of people who do work like that, I couldn&#39;t imagine giving up on human to human contact for 100% of a business. It would be downright maddening!</p>
<p>I&#39;m here with my sister and we&#39;ll be back in Singapore late this week.</p>
