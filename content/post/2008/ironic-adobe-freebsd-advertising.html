<p>While reading a <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2008/02/26/whats-new-in-freebsd-70.html">fascinating interview</a> with senior contributors about the improvements in <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/releases/7.0R/relnotes.html">FreeBSD 7.0</a> at the <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/bsd/">OnLamp BSD Dev Centre</a>, I couldn&#39;t help but notice a certain problem with the page:</p>
<p><a href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.adobe.irony.png"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.adobe.irony.thumb.png" alt="OnLamp BSD Dev Centre article on FreeBSD 7.0" style="height:355px; width:500px;" /></a></p>
<p>Can you see it? I&#39;ll give you a hint: it starts with an &quot;A&quot; and ends in a &quot;dobe&quot;! Yes, Adobe is advertising their Flex framework, on a website dedicated to an <strong>operating system they refuse to support!</strong></p>
<p>Just for more fun, if you click on their advertisement on your trustworthy FreeBSD box as I did, you&#39;re told you need to download Adobe Flash. Clicking on that link takes you to a page where they tell you that <em>&quot;We are unable to locate a Web player that matches your platform and browser&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>Little hint Adobe, don&#39;t advertise your products to people who can&#39;t use them, even if they wanted to.</p>
