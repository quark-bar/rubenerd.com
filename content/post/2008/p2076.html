<p>That poor Sarah Palin just can&#39;t catch a break on television it seems, even with all her lipstick, bridges to nowhere, Russia sightings and Joe Sixpacks! The tragic hilarity of her campaign has been a topic of conversation even on the streets of Adelaide thousands of kilometers away: I&#39;ve heard her name mentioned by people walking around over a dozen times and news reporters have mentioned her in almost every bulletin in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Even NEWStopia, the ridiculously hilarious satirical news programme on SBS mentioned her this week.</p>
<blockquote><p>
If John F Kennedy had an airport named after him, does that mean if elected Sarah Palin would have one named after her as well? They could call it theâ€¦ Palindrome! HA!

<p>Perhaps the best image though I&#39;ve seen was one that passed through one of the feeds I monitor in Google Reader. If Palin really is looking out for Joe Sixpack, and she insists on calling Obama&#39;s vice presidential nominee Joe, then have at it!</p>
