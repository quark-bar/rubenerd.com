<p>In light of Barack Obama&#39;s historic <a href="//rubenerd.com/p2651/">presidential election victory</a>, it&#39;s easy to forget other elections have been going on around the world recently, such as in New Zealand. Given my interest in <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/">Whole Wheat Radio</a>, the fact I bumped into a couple of people from Alaska in one particular coffee shop in Singapore quite regularly, the fact my dad is interested in Canada next door (thought I&#39;d throw that in), and the fact our neighbours across the street in our rented house in Australia are from Alaska, I&#39;ve also been watching the <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Alaska,_2008">Alaskan State Senate elections</a>. Whew, that was a long sentence.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t pretend to know the details and inner workings of Alaskan politics, but I know enough about incumbent (or should I say <em>&quot;incompetent&quot;</em>) Ted Stevens to know that if he was reelected it would be a crying shame. According to Wikipedia, if he did win he would also be the first convicted felon to be elected to the United States senate.</p>
<p>According to Republican pollster David Dittman in a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/">Huffington Post</a> article (can we trust him?), it looks as though Democrat Mark Begich <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/11/13/stevens-pollster-race-is_n_143660.html">will take the senate seat</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Alaska-based GOP pollster David Dittman, who worked for Sen. Ted Stevens during this year’s primary race, believes Democratic challenger Mark Begich is all but certain to expand his current razor-thin lead and snatch the seat.</p>
<p>&quot;I don’t think Stevens can come back,&quot; Dittman said, noting that he thinks the remaining trove of uncounted ballots will help Begich &#8220;increase his lead.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>After trying to find other sources of information on this from sites ranging from <a href="http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/11/alaska_senate_race_tilts_to_de.html">Swamp Politics</a> to Mark Crispin Miller’s <a href="http://markcrispinmiller.com/2008/11/begich-takes-800-vote-lead.html"> News From Underground</a>, they all seem to be pointing to one <a href="http://www.adn.com/elections/senate/story/587414.html">Alaskan Daily News article</a>:</p>

Begich takes lead in latest vote count<br />
SENATE RACE: Anchorage mayor swings from 3,000-vote deficit to 814-vote advantage.<br />

<p>Mark Begich made a dramatic comeback Wednesday to overtake 40-year incumbent Ted Stevens for the lead in Alaska’s U.S. Senate race.</p>
<p>Begich, who was losing after election night, now leads Stevens by 814 votes — 132,196 to 131,382 — with the state still to count roughly 40,000 more ballots over the next week.</p>
<p>The state Division of Elections tallied about 60,000 absentee, early and questioned ballots from around the state on Wednesday. The ballots broke heavily in the Democrat’s favor, erasing the 3,000-vote lead the Republican Stevens held after election night Nov. 4.

<p>Here&#39;s hoping Alaska makes the right choice, just as the United States on the whole did last week. I&#39;m being pessimistic in advance again, but I&#39;d love to have that overturned.</p>
