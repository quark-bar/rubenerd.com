<p>If you&#39;ve got lots of studying to do and you&#39;d rather not be distracted, don&#39;t make your way over to <a href="http://www.justsayhi.com/">JustSayHi.com</a>, and definitely <em>don&#39;t</em> do any of their addictive quizzes!</p>
<p>Try them out for yourself, and post a comment here if you do well at them, I&#39;d be fascinated to see how people with actual lives do on them! I really should have done better in these myself, guess I hadn&#39;t had enough coffee first :-).</p>

<p>Not impressed with my result, they didn’t ask any questions about how few girlfriends/boyfriends you’ve had, or how much coffee you drink, or how many shirts with UNIX commands on them you have. I would have kicked arse with those!</p>

<p>This is probably an accurate result! As much as I really, really love Apple computers and other devices, I’m not completely addicted to them. Well, almost!</p>

<p>Dang, if only they didn’t have questions about social networks, the protocol questions were easy! </p>
