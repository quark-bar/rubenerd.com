<blockquote><p>This post is going to be part of a series on Xfce, originally posted on my university blog. Iâ€™m republishing them here in the hopes that others might find them useful or interesting. Cheers!</p></blockquote>
<p>You may have noticed a few weeks ago <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p1174/">I announced</a> that I was moving my primary machine over to <a href="http://gnome.org/">GNOME</a> from <a href="http://kde.org/">KDE</a>, mostly because the applications I use most heavily on <a href="http://freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> and <a href="http://debian.org/">GNU/Linux</a> are all <a href="http://gtk.org">GTK+</a> based and it seemed silly to run them in a Qt system. I&#39;m a sucker for eye candy and visual consistency.</p>
<p>Well here I am now typing this on my newly reinstalled FreeBSD, Xfce desktop and it&#39;s running great.</p>
<p><a href="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/screenie.xfce.forest.png"><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/screenie.xfce.forest.thumb.png" alt="My FreeBSD Xfce 4.4.2 desktop!" style="height:313px; width:500px" /></a></p>
<p>You can be forgiven if you&#39;re new to the world of Linux, BSD and X11 in general if you&#39;ve never heard of Xfce; it certainty has been given far less publicity than the heavyweights GNOME and KDE despite it <a href="http://www.linux.com/articles/21045">actually being born around the same time</a>. Unlike GNOME and KDE which strive to be the ultimate desktops with all the bells and whistles, Xfce is designed to be lightweight and fast while still being a usable and complete desktop environment out of the box (as it were). This means unlike vanilla window managers such as <a href="http://rubenerd.com/mikuru-fluxbox-with-rox-filer-on-freebsd/">Fluxbox</a> it also includes a file manager, desktop background and icon support, graphical configuration, panels and so forth. A full list of included goodies is maintained on the <a href="http://www.xfce.org/projects/">Xfce projects site</a>.</p>
<p>The real kicker for me is that as with GNOME, Xfce uses GTK+, meaning all my most used applications such as <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/">Gnumeric</a>, <a href="http://www.abisource.com/">Abiword</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a>, <a href="http://gimp.org/">The Gimp</a>, <a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>, <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/">Thunderbird</a> and the X11 version of <a href="http://vim.org/">VIM</a> all look really slick and match the rest of the system. I&#39;m a sucker for eye candy and visual consistency. Wait, I already said that.</p>
<p>In the coming days I&#39;ll be posting many more entries about my experiences with Xfce including how I&#39;ve customised and used it and some other tidbits I&#39;ve picked up along the way. Stay tuned :-).</p>
