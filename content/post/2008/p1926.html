<p><a href="http://twitter.com/theandykaufman">The Andy Kaufman</a>, the self professed living comedian who supposedly faked his death sometime between 1912 and 2041 has a <a href="http://www.andykaufmanlives.com/questions">series of questions</a> on his website, surprisingly titled <a href="http://www.andykaufmanlives.com/">AndyKaufmanLives.com</a>.</p>
<p>It took me less than 5 minutes to finish it with what I 110% guarantee are all the SUPERIOR as well as CORRECT answers that were all figured out after months of laborious research. Now it&#39;s just a matter of claiming my prize. Prize is spelt with a <em style="text-transform:uppercase">&quot;z&quot;</em> right? To help me explain the salience in my answers (salience?), I&#39;m going to employ some folks from Code Geass. The people from Clannad were getting fed up with my ramblings.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong>I believe it’s related to Santa Clause, Christ and grilled cheese sandwiches as part of a mission to expose covered briefcases that walk away from 70s era bubble walls. Slovakia is on the damned moon people, wake up from your coffee and smell the astroturf! It’s not hard to glance, pretend, expose or sauté mushrooms, all you need is a beginning, a middle and an end-faced bromide concentrate that doesn’t exist, but wishes it did. Damn it wishes it did. Like Baked Alberta. Wait, that was the wrong state.</p>
<p>I could be wrong though, I mean, there’s a first time for everything right?</p></blockquote>
