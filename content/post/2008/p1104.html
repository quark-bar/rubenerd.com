<p>Big shout out to everyone at <a href="http://wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and the <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/">Wikimedia Foundation</a> for reaching <a href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Press_releases/10M_articles">10 million articles</a>! The record breaking entry was an article on English artist <a href="http://hu.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Hilliard">Nicholas Hilliard</a> written in Hungarian. Hungarian of course being the language native to a country called Hungary. Sometimes I surprise even myself.</p>

<p>I wonder what ol&#39; Nick <strong><em>who died in 1619</em></strong> would think about being the 10 millionth article in a collaborative online encyclopaedia powered by electronic computers connected through a globally spanning networkâ€¦ makes you think.</p>
