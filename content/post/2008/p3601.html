<p>We&#39;ll be leaving Adelaide for Singapore for the Christmas holidays and for the first few months of 2009 first thing tomorrow morning. At the last minute our flight was cancelled so we&#39;re flying via Bali, landing at Changi Airport around midnight. I&#39;m going to miss the Boatdeck Cafe, my Aussie friends, cooler weather, the wide open spaces, open debates on television, fantastic food; but I am looking forward to seeing my Singapore friends, eating roti prata and drinking teh tarik at 3am, the guys at the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf at Forum and the Starbucks at Millennia Walk and Suntec City, computers at Funan Centre and Sim Lim Square, the pretty night lightsâ€¦ and spending evenings with my dad talking and laughing at Max Brenners.</p>
<p>See you on the other side!</p>
