<p>This report didn&#39;t take be by surprise at all, but is still interesting. <a href="http://www.smartcompany.com.au/Free-Articles/Trends/20081008-Australians-love-Obama.html">According to Reader&#39;s Digest Australia</a>, Barack Obama completely tramples John McCain:</p>
<blockquote><p>Though Americans are the only voters who matter in next month’s US presidential election, the rest of the world definitely has an opinion. A new Reader’s Digest poll shows an overwhelming majority of Australians want Barack Obama as the next president of the United States.</p>
<p>Over 75% of Australians said they would vote for Obama if they could, while only 10% say they would vote for Republican candidate John McCain.</p>
<p>The poll, which surveyed residents in over 15 countries including Brazil, Canada, Finland, Germany and Mexico, found the majority of respondents want Obama as president. He is most popular in the Netherlands, where 90% of those surveyed want the Illinois senator as president.</p>
<p>A whopping 85% of Australians say they are paying attention to the US election, while nearly 25% say they have a high level of interest.</p>
<p>But they won’t be moving any time soon; 71% of Australians say they don’t want to live in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>This despite these… <em>stupid</em> comments by our former Prime Minister who supported George W. Bush:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/02/11/obama.comment/">CANBERRA, Australia (CNN)</a> &#8212; Australia’s conservative Prime Minister John Howard said Sunday that victory for Democratic Sen. Barack Obama and his party in next year’s presidential election would be a boon for terrorists.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were running al Qaeda in Iraq, I would put a circle around March 2008, and pray, as many times as possible, for a victory not only for Obama, but also for the Democrats,&#8221; Howard said, speaking on &#8220;Sunday,&#8221; a TV show on Australia’s Nine Network.
