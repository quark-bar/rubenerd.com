<cite>Garfield has the right idea…</cite></p>
<p>After several weeks of blissfully normal sleep patterns, I&#39;ve fallen back into a serious rut when it comes to being able to sleep properly, if at all. It seems that for at least one week every month I have to have sleep troubles, as if it&#39;s part of some devious lunar plot. During this designated week, even though I get up at roughly the regular time, I lie in bed wide awake as I watch the clock tick past 01:00, then 02:00, then 03:00, then 04:00…</p>
<p>Both my parents and my grandmother on my mum&#39;s side have admitted to having serious sleeping problems, but as convenient an excuse it would be for me, I just can&#39;t see genetics as playing a part in this. I definitely need to start doing some inward focused analysis… if that makes any sense.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to make sense at 3am when you can&#39;t sleep so instead of talking myself, I thought I&#39;d use the power of Google Reader to look into the subject of sleep. Isn&#39;t science wonderful?</p>
<p>The first article is from Reuters (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE4B090G20081201?feedType=RSS">Insomnia drug helps jet-lag, shift-work troubles</a>) which coincidently <a href="http://twitter.com/jerrynovak">Jerry Novak on Twitter</a> forwarded to me after seeing my early morning tweets yesterday. It discusses a new treatment possibly being developed for people suffering from sleep trouble. I resolved never to take any sleeping pills simply because I don&#39;t want to develop a nasty dependence, but I might be keeping an eye on this:</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) &#8211; An insomnia drug that helps the body produce more of the sleep hormone melatonin may improve sleep for jet-lagged travelers and shift workers, researchers reported on Monday.</p>
<p>Maryland-based Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. reported on two studies of its drug tasimelteon, also known as VEC-162, that showed it helped patients sleep longer and more deeply than a placebo.</p>
<p>They said that people with so-called circadian rhythm disorders could be helped. These disorders are common causes of insomnia that affect millions of people […]</p></blockquote>
<p>Another recently published article about an unrelated study from the Australian ABC (<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/12/03/2436139.htm">New sleep drug brings hope for shift workers</a>) also shows some promising new developments happening here in Australia:</p>
<blockquote><p>A study into sleep disorders shows a new drug can help people affected by jet lag or shift work.</p>
<p>The Monash University research says the drug tasimelteon can shift the rhythm of melatonin levels in the body.</p>
<p>Melatonin is a marker of the internal biological clock and helps regulate circadian rhythms.</p>
<p>Sleep disorder expert Dr Shantha Rajaratnam says the drug could help patients fall asleep even when they are out of their normal time zone.</p></blockquote>
<p>And finally we fly to Britain for this unconventional BBC Health report (<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7760186.stm">Pop tunes used to calm babies</a>) on how toddlers are being helped to sleep not with lullabies, but with pop songs!</p>
<blockquote><p>Rocking a baby to sleep has been given a whole new meaning as some mothers ditch traditional lullabies for popular pop and rock tunes.</p>
<p>Songs such as Robbie Williams’ Angels and Oasis anthem Wonderwall proved popular in the poll of 2,000 mothers.</p>
<p>The survey found nearly two-thirds thought pop ballads could be better for getting babies to sleep than lullabies like Rock-a-Bye Baby. </p></blockquote>
<p>According to the BBC, the top five most commonly sung songs for kids are Patience by Take That; Angels by Robbie Williams; I Kissed a Girl by Kate Perry; You&#39;re Beautiful by James Blunt and Love Me Tender by Elvis Presley. I can definitely see exactly how all these songs would be calming.</p>

<p>And funnily enough, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angels_(Robbie_Williams_song)">Angels</a> is one of my favourite Robbie Williams songs; it&#39;s got some gorgeous lyrics. Perhaps I need to load up the old iPhone, park it next to the bed and do some musical loops. After I regulate my melatonin and shell out a fortune for some experimental American sleeping drugs of course. Then again, perhaps a glass of cold water and a pleasant stroll around the block and back will suffice.</p>
<p>Do you reckon I&#39;ll ever find an angel? Oh dear, perhaps it&#39;s time I tried sleeping again. G&#39;night everyone.</p>
