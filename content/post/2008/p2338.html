<p>I&#39;m sitting at the <a href="http://www.gloriajeanscoffees.com.au/">Gloria Jean&#39;s</a> coffee shop at the open-air <a href="http://www.harbourtown.com.au/">Harbourtown Shopping Centre</a> waiting for my sister and  taking advantage of a little used feature of my blog: automatic publishing of emails that are sent to a hidden email address the blogging software monitors. Let&#39;s see if it works!</p>
<p>I&#39;m using this feature because this time I didn&#39;t lug my MacBook Pro with me, I&#39;m typing this on my iPhone 3G. I have to be honest, while my eyes are getting used to less screen real estate and having to hold the device in question as I type, my shoulders and back much prefer this arrangement!</p>
<p>As I&#39;ve elaborated numerous times on the <a href="//rubenerd.com/show/">Rubenerd Show</a> and even more times on <a href="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd/">Twitter</a>, I am perfectly comfortable using the iPhone&#39;s touch screen keyboard. In fact now I&#39;ve had this iPhone for over a month now, I&#39;m faster on this virtual keyboard than I ever was on the physical QWERTY keypads on my <a href="http://www.nokia-asia.com/A4415314">Nokia e61</a> or my <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/support/tungstenw/">Tungsten W</a>. Because I&#39;m just tapping the surface rather than pressing physical buttons, my thumbs are just flying.</p>
<p>What I also really appreciate about the iPhone keyboard is it&#39;s excellent error correction and punctuation fixing. What this means is I can type lowercase &quot;ive&quot; and it will automatically change it to &quot;I&#39;ve&quot;. I use this feature constantly, it means I can rapidly type a sentence and the phone fixes it all up.</p>
<p>I&#39;m just going to come out and say it, I love this phone. In an up and coming post I&#39;m going to demonstrate a real world application of all the features this phone hasâ€¦ by recounting a recent trip where I literally was able to get around with just this device. Without sounding too cheesy, this device has given me a degree of mobility I&#39;ve never had before. Even ignoring the iPod music features, I have maps, GPS, the web browser, text messaging and Twitter &#8211; all in a device that is 1000% easier and nicer to use than an N95 or any other &quot;navigation smart phone&quot; I&#39;ve ever tried. I cannot possibly imagine my life without this phone now, despite spending the first 22 years of my life without one.</p>
