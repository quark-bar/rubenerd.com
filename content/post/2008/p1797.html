<p>While rearranging my Dashboard widgets on my MacBook Pro this morning, I accidently stumbled upon  a feature in the Weather widget which upon later investigation has already been well documented. At least I felt like an electronic archaeologist for a few minutes!</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t tried this out already though, give it a shot:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fire up your Dashboard, usually with the <code>F12</code> key</li>
<li>Drag a new Weather widget from the widget bar onto the Dashboard</li>
<li>Hold down the <code>Command/Apple</code> and <code>Alt/Option</code> keys</li>
</ol>
<p>You now have a widget with the weather set to <em>&quot;Nowhere&quot;</em>, and by clicking the picture in the top centre you can change the weather conditions. It was cold and raining before in Rubenerd Nowhere, now it&#39;s snowing!</p>
