<cite>Sarah Palin answering questions regarding her domestic policy experience</cite></p>
<p>Despite this blog&#39;s stated purpose of relaying interesting information and how-tos with regards to <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/free-and-open-source/bsd/">BSD</a> and <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/apple/mac-os-x/">Mac OS X</a>, the elections in the United States are just too interesting to pass up. A little too interesting… I&#39;m expecting Fox to jump out at any minute and claim Sarah Palin is actually part of a new reality TV series planned by their writers and producers, along the lines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackass_(TV_series)">Jackass</a>.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s news though is just sad. Despite claiming Barack Obama pals around with terrorists, she dodged a question when asked whether people who bomb abortion clinics are terrorists. Pardon my French, but what tripe. From the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/10/25/2401056.htm">Australian ABC</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Asked by NBC television presenter Brian Williams whether an abortion clinic bomber was a terrorist, Governor Palin heaved a sigh and, at first, circumvented the question. […]</p>
<p>Attacks on doctors who practice abortion and on family planning clinics in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s left several people dead and scores wounded.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact this women is even taken seriously by some people is nothing short of being blood chillingly scary. In the last few days I&#39;ve even seen a few bumper stickers on cars in Adelaide that read <em>&quot;Don&#39;t let your American friends vote for McCain and Palin&quot;</em>.</p>
