<p>So I was typing up a post on the MacBook FireWire Debacle when I noticed with the aide of a dotted red line that I misspelled the word &quot;obsolescence&quot;. Upon control-clicking the word to see suggested alternative spellings, I was told I should try the option above. Say what?!</p>
<p>Now as a dreadfully shy computer nerd who tends to sit in coffee shops with his laptop when he&#39;s not at work or studying, it&#39;s very hard for me to ask this because I have no experience with receiving such things, and it is really late at night… but is my MacBook Pro hitting on me?</p>
