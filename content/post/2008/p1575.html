<cite>The mighty little EyeTV</cite></p>
<p>For some reason I&#39;ve had really bad luck with computer hardware over the last few years. Faulty external hard drives literally burning out the internal FireWire port on my MacBook Pro, D-Link routers failing more times than I can count on one hand, new batteries barely holding a charge, ExpressCards that only work when they want to, not being able to use a brand new headset… I was starting to think electronic gremlins had it in for me.</p>
<p>I belabor all this to put in context the thrill I felt today when I went to the NextByte Apple store in Rundle Mall, bought myself a USB <a href="http://www.elgato.com/elgato/int/mainmenu/products/tuner/DTT/product1.en.html">EyeTV Digital TV tuner</a>, plugged it into my terrestrial antenna, and it <em>worked</em> the instant I plugged it in! They&#39;ve definitely come a long way from the first TV tuner card I bought back in 2002 that plugged into a PCI slot on my desktop and was more temperamental than I am without coffee!</p>

<cite>An example of a HD signal compared to the resolution of my MBP. The show is Q &amp; A, a fascinating political debate show on ABC1. They really need a show like this back in Singapore!</cite></p>
<p>For those who haven&#39;t seen this device before, the USB EyeTV Digital TV Tuner is a small device barely larger than a regular USB memory key but with a coaxial cable plug on the other side which you plug the cable leading to your antenna into. I bought the most basic version for AUS$120.00 that comes bundled with a small desktop antenna, a USB extention cable for those using a MacBook Air, and the EyeTV software that lets you view shows, make recordings and skip advertisements.</p>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/icon.eyetv.png"  alt="EyeTV icon" style="height:192px; width:192px; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px" /> There are many different models with different capabilities; there are dual signal switching versions which will pick the best signal out of two inputs in realtime (useful for in cars I&#39;ve been told) and there&#39;s even a so-called Deluxe version which comes with a fancier annena and other goodies. Both of these also let you record a channel which watching another, but I didn&#39;t feel I really needed this, or that the extra cost justified it.</p>
<p>After dragging the <code>EyeTV.app</code> application over to my <code>/Applications</code> folder and launching it for the first time I was presented with a setup wizard that told me to plug the antenna into the EyeTV device, then plug the device itself into the Mac. Then it was simply a matter of scanning for the digital versions of all the free-to-air Aussie channels, and then I was watching them. The whole process took less than 10 minutes!</p>

<p>When I bought the EyeTV tuner I knew I&#39;d be plugging it into the terrestrial antenna, so I went to <a href="http://dicksmith.com.au/">Dick Smith</a> (for my American readers, it&#39;s basically like Radio Shack) at the Myer Centre in Rundle Mall and purchased a shielded coaxial cable for $12. I thought I&#39;d humour myself by plugging in the bundled antenna and trying it out first, but it couldn&#39;t find any channels at all. Plugged into the wall, I got perfect, 100% reception and distortian free images for all the digital versions of the free to air Aussie networks, including all the High Definition channels. Very nice!</p>
<p>The picture quality is ridiculously good! While the regular digital TV pictures come through and take up a sizable part of my MacBook Pro&#39;s 1440&#215;900 resolution screen, the high definition versions take up almost the entire screen! Of course you can make them full screen which I&#39;m sure would work great with an external second monitor, but for me I just get a kick out of watching Huey&#39;s Cooking Adventures on my Mac desktop!</p>
<p><a href="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/screenie.eyetv.huey.png"><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/screenie.eyetv.huey.jpg" alt="Huey's Cooking Adventures!" style="height:291px; width:500px;" /></a><br />
<cite>One of the shows I really missed when I lived in Singapore was Huey&#39;s Cooking Adventures! Go Huey!!!</cite></p>
<p>Recording shows is also a snap. As I said before the basic version that I bought doesn&#39;t have the capability of viewing other channels while you&#39;re recording, but the recordings it generates are indistinguishable from the original! Unfortunately the output is a <code>.eyetv</code> file which has to be played in the EyeTV application, but you can easily export to QuickTime or even sizes for your iPod.</p>
<p>The only thing that I don&#39;t like about the EyeTV software itself is that it uses the American Month/Day/Year format instead of the International Day/Month/Year format. I can tell that 08/29/2008 actually means 29/08/2008 because there isn&#39;t a 29th month, but I&#39;m worried it might get a bit ambiguous and confusing when it comes to 02/03/2010 or something similar!</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> For what it’s worth, on my sites and on my computers I always use Year.Month.Day to clear up all ambiguity, and so that the computer can sort them properly!</p></blockquote>
<p>I was going to discuss the different high definition channels that the EyeTV can pick up in Adelaide and what has changed since 2005 when I was hear last, but I&#39;ve decided to leave that for another post. I&#39;ll add the URL here once I&#39;ve finished it.</p>
<p>The final verdict? TV tuners have come a long way! If you have a modern Mac with at least a G5 or Intel processor and want a quick, easy and affordable way to watch terrestrial TV channels, absolutely look no further! Aside from the date problem and the proprietary recording format which you need to convert from, it&#39;s perfect! Four and a half stars :-).</p>
