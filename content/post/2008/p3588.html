<p>In Australia and New Zealand we have something which most of the world does not, though in this case it&#39;s not something to be proud of. Our internet service providers have this fabulous system that serve their customers needs first: bandwidth shaping.</p>
<p>For those lucky enough not to have to put up with this system, bandwidth shaping is a system that restricts how much data you can download (and in some cases upload) per month. And it doesn&#39;t come cheap; for a measly 40GB per month here in Adelaide my sister and I pay just over AU$100. Comparing this to our home connection in Singapore where (according to our router) we download hundreds of gigabytes of data a month for less than SG$80, it&#39;s rather pathetic.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> It also doesn’t exactly make a technical person such as myself who has lived overseas and has experienced proper internet want to return to Australia to start a tech related business. Australia is a beautiful place with really good food and an enviable lifestyle, but if I can’t get internet I can rely on, it’s just not a viable option :(</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyway in anticipation of going back to Singapore over the holidays, my sister and I have been celebrating by burning through a months worth of quota in less than a week. We&#39;ll be out of the country during most of our next 40GB allocated month, so we figure we&#39;ll take advantage of it. We&#39;re both very wild people you see.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been torrenting all the disc images for the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">latest beta versions of FreeBSD</a>, <a href="http://slackware.com/getslack/">Slackware</a> and <a href="http://netbsd.org/releases/index.html#formal">NetBSD</a>; I&#39;ve been compiling huge ports such as <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME 2.22</a> from source; I&#39;ve been downloading the H264 video versions of <a href="http://www.crankygeeks.com/">Cranky Geeks</a>, I&#39;ve been listening to the high quality versions of internet radio… the list just goes on and on!</p>

<p>We must be doing something right, because we just got this email from Internode (our ISP). Sorry guys, but we paid a ridiculous sum of money for 40 gigabytes, and by golly we&#39;re gonna download 40 gigabytes!</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Internode customer,</p>
<p>This is an automated message […] We have sent this message in order to assist you to manage your account usage. Your current downloads for the account […] have exceeded 70% of your download allowance this month. At the time this message was generated, you had downloaded 29630 Mb. Your monthly download allowance is currently 40000 Mb.</p>
<p>No excess usage fees are incurred on this plan; however your download rate will be reduced if you exceed 100% of your download quota before your next rollover date. You do not need to take any action, however if you exceed 90% of your monthly quota we’ll send you another email as a reminder. Once you’ve used 100% of your quota, we will apply &#8216;shaping’ which will reduce the speed of your service until your next rollover date. After 3,000 Mbytes of shaped traffic, additional access constraints may be applied. You have the option of:</p>
<ul>
<li>reducing your downloads (eg by disabling peer to peer filesharing or other high download services); or</li>
<li>purchasing additional data blocks for an instant quota upgrade; or</li>
<li>upgrading to a plan with a higher monthly quota (though this only takes effect at your next rollover date)</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for using Internode!</p></blockquote>
