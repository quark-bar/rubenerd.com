<cite>Perth Skyline, Western Australia</cite></p>
<p>Because my sister, dad and I couldn&#39;t get a direct flight between Singapore and Adelaide, we had to go via Perth. Given none of us had ever really spent much time there, we took the opportunity to stay a few nights and have a look around.</p>
<p>For those outside Australia, Perth is the capital of the aptly-named state of Western Australia with a population of just under 2 million, and according to Wikipedia it&#39;s one of the world&#39;s most isolated cities. Conventiently it&#39;s in the same timezone as Singapore!</p>
<p>You can see some of the photos I&#39;ve managed to upload as I sit at this internet cafe over on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/sets/72157606345986105/">Back in Australia 2008</a> Flickr gallery.</p>
