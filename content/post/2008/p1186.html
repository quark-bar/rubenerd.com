<p>Despite WordPress assigning this post as <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/p1186/">p1186</a>, this is in fact the 767th post! Yes, it&#39;s time for another one of our <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">really hated</span> loved Useless Rubenerd Blog milestones!</p>
<p>Given the fact I&#39;m in the 700+ range of posts, there are some posts which have the same number as famous Boeing airliners. Being a huge fan of commercial aviation, I figured I&#39;d create some small posts about these planes. I missed the boat on the 707/720 and 727 (no, I&#39;m sorry the 717 was the MD-95!) but I did do posts on the <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/p1155/">737</a>, <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/p1166/">747</a> and <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/p1177/ ">757</a></p>

<cite>This is clearly the wrong picture</cite></p>
<p>The Boeing 767 airliner was first introduced by Boeing (no joke) in 1978 and began flying with airlines in 1982. It was designed for short to medium range travel with a twin jet configuration and a range of 9,400 to 12,200 km&#39;s and the ability to carry 181 to 375 passengers. The capacity could be increased for a nominal fee by bolting deck chairs on the wings; surprisingly no airline took up Boeing on the offer. Unlike most competing airframes for that market segment from the time period, the 767 was designed with a widebody, dual isle configuration.</p>
<p>A defining feature of the 767 was its common cockpit and avionics design with the 757, meaning a pilot trained to fly one could learn and be certified to fly the other in a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>Demand for the 767 peaked in 1997, when the 767-400ER was introduced and implemented by a number of American airlines to replace their aging Lockheed L-1011s and Douglass DC-10 trijets, not to be confused with <a href="http://www.ubergizmo.com/15/archives/2007/09/amd_tricore_drama.html">AMD tricore desktop processors</a> or <a href="http://www.memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Tricorder">Star Trek tricorders</a>. Demand has especially fallen recently as plans for the direct replacement 787 Dreamliner have been made. Today most customers are purchasing airframes for use as cargo freighters; the 767 derived KC-767 aerial refueling platforms have also been purchased in large numbers by the Italian, Japanese and American governments.</p>
