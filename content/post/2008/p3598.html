<p>Sorry for the downright awful heading, it was the best I could come up with having not slept for 48 hours. You know how it is.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been telling friends stranded in lifeboats with their <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p3533/">exported data</a> after the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p3524/">sinking of Pownce</a> (all three of them!) to grab themselves a <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter account</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd">add me</a> and join in the never ending fun conversations. Unfortunately as far as I know Twitter doesn&#39;t include an option to import previous messages you might have exported from Pownce. If it were me I wouldn&#39;t mind, I talk far too much anyway… this is an undisputed fact. Why even these last two sentences have been completely superfluous and unnecessary. Make that the last three sentences.</p>
<p>An alternative is the alternative rich microblogging site <a href="http://soup.io/">Soup.io</a> which has created an import feature specifically for former Powncers. <a href="http://updates.soup.io/show/9066526">From their Updates account</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last week, Pownce surprisingly gave their users two weeks notice – they’re shutting down the service on December 15 after having being acquired by SixApart.<br />
We’ve built this migration tool to offer abandoned Powncers a new home. We even added another post type to be able to properly import everything.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their easy to remember <a href="http://www.soup.io/pownce">http://www.soup.io/pownce</a> page has the importer. As far as I can tell, you don&#39;t even need to be logged in or have an account at all, pretty nice. They&#39;re also <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/soup">accepting feedback</a>.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://rubenerd.soup.io/">created a Soup.io account</a>, but as of yet I haven&#39;t used it for anything. I absolutely applaud them though for bucking the trend with Web 8.0 businesses or whatever version they&#39;re up to yet by using a name that&#39;s <strong>SPELLED PROPERLY</strong>. Even in 1997 I was worried about the name &quot;Rubenerd&quot; being a concatenation of Ruben and Nerd, but at least that&#39;s not just misspelled for the sake of being misspelled.</p>
<p>See I think that&#39;s why Pownce failed, <em>&quot;Powncers&quot;</em> just doesn&#39;t sound as cute as <em>&quot;Twitterers&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;Tweeters&quot;</em>. If you&#39;re a Soup user, does that make you <em>&quot;Souper duper?&quot;</em>. I think I&#39;ll soup now. <strong>STOP NOW</strong>, I meant to say I think I&#39;ll stop now. Pownce.</p>
