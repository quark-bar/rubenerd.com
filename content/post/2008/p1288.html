<p>Quite often I find myself using a particular application for a long time, and only realising that something I&#39;m doing can be done a lot simpler, or even automatically. A quick smack on the head with the palm of my hand and a few shots of espresso is generally called for, followed by implementing the previously unused feature.</p>
<p>In this case it&#39;s a feature of the improved and vastly more usable new Terminal.app bundled with Mac OS X Leopard. In earlier versions of OS X I used <a href="http://materm.sourceforge.net/">mrxvt</a> in <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/">X11</a> for most of my shell goodness; a less elegant alternative to <a href="http://iterm.sourceforge.net/">iTerm</a> but one which I found more reliable. Unlike previous Terminal.app versions, mrxvt had a tabbed interface, and exited automatically whenever the process you were working on finished cleanly. I knew Terminal.app in Leopard had the former feature but not the latterâ€¦ despite it being right under my nose the whole time.</p>

<p>To get the Leopard Terminal.app to automatically close its window when the process you&#39;re working on finishes cleanly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hit <code>[Command]</code>+<code>[,]</code> to bring up the Preferences screen</li>
<li>Click <code>Settings</code>, then click the theme you want to change.</li>
<li>Click <code>Shell</code> and choose <code>Close if the shell exited cleanly</code> from the <code>When the shell exits:</code> listbox.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now whenever a process you&#39;ve initiated finishes, or if you type <code>exit</code> in your shell, the window closes automatically. When you have tens of tabs open at once, this saves a LOT of time!</p>
