<p>For those of you who are also using the <a href="http://userstyles.org/styles/12673">&quot;Google Reader (12/05/2008) Tweaks&quot;</a> Greasemonkey script that makes <a href="//rubenerd.com/p3580/">Google Reader usable again</a>, you may have noticed Google tweaked the interface just enough to break it. It&#39;s as if the Reader folks want you to like the new interface regardless! I hope they don&#39;t make this a habit.</p>
<p>Fortunately <a href="http://userstyles.org/users/2945">trashrockx</a> has updated the script to remove Blazing White again. Uninstall your current version and update if this has affected you. Don&#39;t worry about the date in the name of the script still referring to the 5th of this month, it is an updated script.</p>
<p>Clearly from looking above I have a lot of reading ahead of me. And I&#39;m supposed to be spending this weekend and next week moving gigabytes of accumulated files. Let&#39;s see what Atuu says about Wal-Mart first though. We don&#39;t have Wal-Mart in Australia or Singapore, what are they? Do they sell pre fabricated house sidings and stuff? Walls? And I was under the impression there were only a limited number of walls you could fabricate depending on what materials they&#39;re made out of.</p>
