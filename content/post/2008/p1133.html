<p>If you&#39;re in Singapore and are bored one afternoon, get yourself some thrills by going to the <a href="http://www.apple.com.sg/">Apple website</a> and attempt to <a href="http://www.apple.com.sg/iwork/trial/">download a trial copy</a> of <a href="http://www.apple.com.sg/iwork/">iWork 2008</a>. Not only will each virtual disk image you download fail, but they&#39;ll all <em>silently</em> fail at different times and after a different amount of data has been transferred!</p>

<cite>So many failed iWork downloads, so little time</cite></p>
<p>I should fire up Numbers in iWork and create a bar chart comparing the different sizes of each of these failed downloads. Oh, waitâ€¦</p>
