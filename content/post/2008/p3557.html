<p>It&#39;s been just over a week since we&#39;ve had another Rubenerd Fun Facts post… so here are another ten fresh Rubenerd Fun Facts! As I&#39;ve mentioned previously, all these facts are irrefutable and 110% true.</p>
<p>If you missed them, feel free to refer to the previous Rubenerd Fun Facts posts (<a href="//rubenerd.com/p2978/">part one</a>, <a href="//rubenerd.com/p3082/">part two</a>) and my post where I ecstatically reported my purchase of <a href="//rubenerd.com/p2962/">David Letterman&#39;s Late Show Fun Facts</a> book. And as usual, feel free to take notes.</p>
