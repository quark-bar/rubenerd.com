<p>It&#39;s time for another of our beloved, quirky and highly useless <a href="http://rubenerd.com/">Rubenerd Blog</a> milestonesâ€¦ this is post number 800! And by sheer coincidence, not only does this post contain the number eight, but it&#39;s also Singapore&#39;s national day.</p>
<p>Well okay, I&#39;m a few days late, but better late then never right? :-)</p>
