<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE, 20:16:</strong> Jim talked about this issue on his latest <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Audio_magazines">audio magazine</a> and posted a comment below. As Jean Luc Picard would say: &quot;stand down red alert!&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the great things about <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Whole Wheat Radio</a>, the internet radio station and collaborative wiki for independent artists and just damn nice music, is that you can listen to it anywhere where you have a stable internet connection! Unfortunately, recently it seems to have issues with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless@SG">Wireless@SG</a>, Singapore&#39;s free island-wide WiFi service. When I was at Starbucks yesterday evening at 23:30 having a well deserved Chai Latte (I figure it&#39;s not good drinking coffee at that time of day!) I got the following error message:</p>
<p><img src="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.wwrerror.png" alt="Whole Wheat Radio IP address error" style="height:238px; width:500px" /></p>
<p>I was very used to seeing this message both at home and in public WiFi hotspots when I lived in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia in 2006, but this was the first time I&#39;d seen it here. I assume it was because in Malaysia the broadband provider TMnet shoehorns many customers onto the one IP address in places and uses some form of NAT system, and perhaps Wireless@SG in Singapore is doing a similar thing.</p>
<p>One thing I have noticed about Wireless@SG is the number of IP addresses you&#39;re served at any given time. Sometimes I can be sitting at a Starbucks, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf, San Francisco Coffee or Dome for several hours at a time (coffee shops are so much nicer to study and work in than a study hall, and they&#39;re a nice change from sitting at home all day) and I&#39;ve noticed my MacBook Pro will be served 20 or so new addresses in that time period. In that case, I certainly can&#39;t blame WWR for blocking me, I&#39;m sure from their end such activity looks pretty sus.</p>
<p>I guess just like my detailed documentation on Whole Wheat Radio audio players for Linux and FreeBSD, this information would probably not be useful to most people, but just letting potential Singaporean listeners know that it&#39;s not their fault, or WWR&#39;s fault, it&#39;s the WiFi system. Perhaps WWR here is best listened to at home.</p>
