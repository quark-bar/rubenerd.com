<p>So, I was doing a Google search to compare Windows anti-virus tools, and across this site called LockerGnome. Aside from being a site for what I can only assume are incacerated mythical creatures, I now know I’m a crook.</p>
<blockquote><p>You have been blocked from entering this site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh.</p>
<blockquote><p>You have attempted an Authors Table attack on this site.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*BUZZER* Sorry, you lucked out. Your consolation prize is a free course on security fundamentals from the University of Wikipedia.</p>
<blockquote><p>All of the following information has been gathered to assist the webmaster should this need to be report [sic] to local or federal [sic] officers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, I’m starting to see the issue. LockerGnome has such flagrant disregard for their users, they’ve emplyed the use of a crappy security suite written by people who can’t even write proper English. Nice job, guys.</p>
<p>The good news is I’ll never see this again, because it’ll now be on my block list. Good riddance.</p>
