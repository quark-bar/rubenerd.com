<p>For about a year now my MacBook Pro exhibited horrible grinding, rattling sounds on the right hand side of the unit, just below the power button. After doing a bit of research I realised that I had a damaged fan (Apple unit number 922-7194), and while I could have tried lubricating the existing one, I decided to play it safe and just buy a replacement. <a href="http://www.pbparts.com/shop.php//9227194.html">PBParts.com</a> had the best overall price for the unit and international shipping to Australia, and had the unit to me in less than 2 weeks with economy mail.</p>
<p>Rather than take photos as I usually do for such projects, I decided to edit together a crappy little video showing what I did, and so you could hear the difference yourself! I just can&#39;t believe how whisper quiet this MacBook Pro is again, I literally cannot hear it unless I turn off every other appliance and peripheral in the room!</p>
<p>Apologies to my readers on BSD, alas because my current host&#39;s bandwidth quota is almost used up, I&#39;ve had to  uploaded the video on YouTube.</p>
