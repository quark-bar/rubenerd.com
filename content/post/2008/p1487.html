<p>I just walked outside our house in <a href="http://www.mawsonlakes.com.au/">Mawson Lakes</a> in Northern Adelaide (Australia) and took a photo of the newly built Mawson Lakes Interchange train station (00:47 Central Australian Time). They spared no expense in lighting it up, the blue lights are a nice touch! Forgive the bad camera angle, the moment I took this shot the batteries died.</p>

<p>Now if they&#39;d just finish building the houses around us so we&#39;re not woken up by jackhammers every morning we&#39;ll be in business.</p>
