<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/finger_key.jpg" alt="Yubikey" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px;" />After listening to a recent episode of <a href="http://twit.tv/sn/">Security Now</a> I&#39;ve gone ahead and purchased myself a <a href="http://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey/">Yubikey</a>!</p>
<p>The Yubikey is a phenomenal new device that&#39;s smaller than most memory keys that when plugged into a USB port and the loan button on the case is pressed, a one time password is generated and entered. It does this on any HID enabled operating system including my beloved Mac OS X and FreeBSD without extra drivers because it shows itself as a <em>regular USB keyboard</em>. It&#39;s so beautifully simple!</p>
<p>The best part is that the <a href="http://www.yubico.com/developers/api/">API</a> is open and accessible from a number of different programming languages such as Ruby, PHP and Python (not sure about Perl just yet).</p>
<p>In the coming weeks I&#39;m going to try to implement my Yubikey into my Ruby CMS. I&#39;m really excited!</p>
