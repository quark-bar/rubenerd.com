<p>Most of the time when I find a useful website I post it on my del.icio.us account and leave it at that. This site was so good though I figure its worth its own post.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org">Evolt Browser Archive</a> on the <a href="http://evolt.org/">Evolt.org</a> web designer network site is simply amazing; Adrian Roselli and a slew of contributors have created the most comprehensive online archive of older web browsers of any site I&#39;ve ever seen. The potential for site designers (and nostalgic 90s web surfers) is huge; from this one site you could download virtually every older browser and test your designs and site functions in them.</p>

<p>Aside from the regular Internet Explorers and Firefoxes, they also have such gems as <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/?ibrowse/">iBrowse</a> for the Commodore Amiga, classic <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/?netpositive/">NetPositive</a> for BeOS, <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/?worldwideweb/">WorldWideWeb</a> by Tim Berners-Lee and the long since dead <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/?neoplanet/">NeoPlanet</a>, the browser I used for a while when I was in primary school! They&#39;re not limited to graphical browsers either; <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/?links/">Links</a> and <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/?lynx/">Lynx</a> both have a huge number of versions available.</p>
<p>My only gripe would be that their emphasis seems to be on proprietary and older browsers; <a href="http://konqueror.kde.org/">Konqueror</a>, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/epiphany/">Epiphany</a> and my lovable speedy <a href="http://www.dillo.org/">Dillo</a> (that didn&#39;t sound right) aren&#39;t archived at all. The latest versions of these browsers are easily installed with your Unix-like system&#39;s package manager though I guess.</p>
<p>I pass this site on to you simply because it has made my life much easier, and if you&#39;re a designer I&#39;m sure it would make your life easier too. Now if you&#39;d excuse me, I&#39;m off to install Netscape Navigator Gold 2.0 on my Windows 95 virtual machine.</p>
