<p>It seems I unwittingly irked a fan of Bill O&#39;Reilly and Fox News on my Flickr profile earlier this year without realising it! It all started with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/1294327989/">this photo I uploaded in November 2007 </a> along with the following caption.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Quote from the cable TV magazine:</p>
<p>&#8220;With his irreverent sensibilities, veteran journalist Nill O’Reilly breaks through the spin and rhetoric of news events to reach the crux of the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>They called him &#8220;NILL&#8221;! That can’t possibly be a typo!</p>
<p>Also ironic that the article next to his is &#8220;The Sacred Balance&#8221; which details global warming, something which I’m sure Nillo denies is happening :)
</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/1294327989/" title="Singapore magazine misspells Bill O'Reilly! by rubenerd, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1294/1294327989_1c478240c7_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Singapore magazine misspells Bill O'Reilly!" /></a></p>
<p>I thought the addition of the smiley face at the end of the sentence and the general jovial tone of the comment was fairly obvious, but a fellow Flickr user by the name of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nickcarchidi/">nicksmultiverse</a> had other ideas:</p>
<blockquote><p>No actually see, your statement right there is wrong. They may have misspelled Bill’s name, but you are a fool for &#8220;assuming&#8221; that he doesn’t think Global Warming is happening.</p>
<p>Maybe if you lefty loons listened for a change, watched his show, instead of this &#8220;assuming&#8221; and believing by &#8220;word of mouth&#8221; you would get your facts straight. Bill DOES believe in Global Warming, but he’s on the fence like most of us. (Us, the people who believe it is naturally occurring) Hence, the planets own heating and cooling and Human activity.</p>
<p>Wise up!</p></blockquote>
<p>I tried to come up with a witty line to put here, but one isn&#39;t coming to me right now. Grilled cheese sandwiches.</p>
<blockquote><p>You may be right sir, or you <a href="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1070">may be wrong</a>, or you may be <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200803040011">very wrong</a>. The point though is that I think you misunderstood the tone of my comment; I’m willing to chalk up your response to this. You should also make sure you’re not assuming anything about me (<em>&quot;lefty loon&quot;</em>) or other people (<em>&quot;on the fence like most of us&quot;</em>) when you’re arguing against assumptions in the first place.</p>
<p>Bill O’Reilly has been caught out numerous times distorting facts and lying. You should attempt to <em>&quot;wise up&quot;</em> to this sir before you start crassly instructing others to do so. And please try to be less rude in your comments; when we keep discussion civil we can have far more fruitful conversations. Cheers :).</p></blockquote>
