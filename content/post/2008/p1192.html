<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Power is back on again! I’ve lived in Singapore on and off (pun intended) for over a decade, and this is only the second blackout I can remember having here (failures from blown fuses in our crappy switch box don’t count!).</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a power failure all along the Stevens Road area (Stevens, Balmoral, Draycott). The security guards at our apartment building say that power will be back in 1-2 hours. Not sure how they know this, but I&#39;m sitting at a Starbucks using the internet right now while I wait.</p>
<p>Power failures suck harder than my Vax… the appliance not the computer! Well, neither would work without power.</p>
