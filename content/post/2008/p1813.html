<p>Yesterday during one of my much enjoyed and looked forward to weekend coffee breaks with my MacBook Pro at the <a href="http://theboatdeck.com/">Boatdeck Cafe</a> in Mawson Lakes, I posted a verbose, long winded, fun and largely ridiculous post discussing ways in which bloggers can help to maintain a regular post schedule.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> I’m still holding out that if I mention the name of their establishment in almost every post I make, they’ll eventually start sponsoring this blog and my podcast. Flawless logic right? If they can’t afford to pay me, I’d just as happily accept a few free cups a day. Whatya say guys?</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/9rules.png" alt="9rules leaf logo" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px; height:113px; width:97px" />What I wasn&#39;t expecting was a comment from none other than Mike Rundle not of our beloved <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1687/">Rundle Mall</a> I discussed a few weeks ago, but of the selective <a href="http://9rules.com">9rules</a> blog community in the States. Who would have thunk it?</p>
<p>As it turns out, he was responding to an off the cuff remark I made under the &quot;Caching Solution&quot; heading:</p>
<blockquote><p>To appear as though you’re more reliable to website alliances like 9rules that value regularity over quality, people write several posts a day, but release them over a period of days.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mike was quick to correct my misapprehension:</p>
<blockquote><p>
At 9rules we value over quality over quantity any day of the week, and especially when we’re looking at blogs that want to join. If somebody split entries up over a few days just to look like they’re posting more frequently then we’d see right through that.</p>
<p>We’d much rather see a 9r member post great articles once a week or so then lesser quality articles every few days.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As someone who:</p>
<ul>
<li>discusses his primary interest in computer software and lifestyle on his blog</li>
<li>posts only on a semi-regular basis</li>
<li>does it just as a hobby</li>
<li>enjoys grilled cheese sandwiches</li>
<li>isn’t even living in the same country as the time zone reported on the site half the time</li>
<li>posts as many multifarious, random posts as on-topic posts</li>
</ul>
<p>… I would certainly never quality for 9rules or any other such site. It doesn&#39;t bother me though because I&#39;m clearly not what they&#39;re looking for. Besides, it works both ways: I&#39;m certainly not changing what I like to do to conform to another system!</p>
<p>I did appreciate Mike&#39;s comment though and replied with a comment that looks quite like this one. Word for word almost, it&#39;s uncanny.</p>
<blockquote><p>Thanks for your comment Mike.</p>
<p>Rest assured I was mentioning your site very much tongue in cheek! That said, lets just say I know that on the basis of regularity (to say nothing of quality, and only talking about specific subjects) I certainly wouldn’t qualify, and I was making light of it.</p>
<p>I guess being a member of the &quot;Ruben Schade&quot; blogging network is enough work as is, right? :-)</p></blockquote>
<p>You can find 9rules (surprising thought it may seem) at <a href="http://9rules.com/">http://9rules.com/</a>. For what it&#39;s worth, I did manage to find <a href="http://architectures.danlockton.co.uk">Dan Lockton&#39;s</a> fascinating sustainable architecture website through them, even if he&#39;s no longer a member.</p>
