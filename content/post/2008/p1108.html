<p>With all my talk on <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/open-source/bsd/">FreeBSD</a> and <a href="//rubenerd.com/category/apple/mac-os-x/">Mac OS X</a>, as well as my generally unfavorable attitude to Microsoft&#39;s operating systems, I decided today to finally install Windows Vista on my primary desktop to do a more in depth review and to see if Service Pack 1 has fixed some of the more irritating problems.</p>
<p>This morning with my paycheck I marched down to <a href="http://www.bestdenki.com.sg/">Best Denki</a> at <a href="http://www.ngeeanncity.com.sg/">Ngee Ann City</a> and purchased a copy of <em>Windows Vista Home Premium</em>. I figured there was no point getting the <em>Ultimate</em> version seeing as I don&#39;t really play many computer games, and the Ultimate Extras offerings <a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20070227/vista-ultimate-extras-sham/">have been less than stellar</a>. I bought the upgrade version because I already had a copy Windows XP Home Edition already from 2002; the one I had for less than a week before I wiped my machine and reinstalled Windows 2000 Professional.</p>
<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/PartitionMagic-8.jpg" alt="PowerQuest PartitionMagic" style="height:200px; width:165px; margin: 0 20px 10px 0; float:left;" /> Beforehand I used my trusty older copy of <em>PartitionMagic 8.0</em> (the last version released by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerQuest">PowerQuest</a> before they were bought out and destroyed by Symantec) to resize my FreeBSD partition down by 64GiB to allow space for Vista to install. FreeBSD really doesn&#39;t like sharing hard disk space with other operating systems, so it&#39;s usually a good idea to have it installed first before you start installing Windows, or Linux for that matter.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t post any screenshots of the installation given that it didn&#39;t have an OS on it to do so (for obvious reasons!), but not having the kludgy DOS screen like messages was certainly a fresh and welcome change from previous versions of Windows; no doubt the FreeBSD <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/books/handbook/using-sysinstall.html">sysinstall</a> folks could learn something from it. It detected all of my hardware flawlessly, including a troublesome 64-in-one card reader that even my MacBook Pro with Leopard had difficulty with.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes of finishing the install, activating online and adjusting the resolution to fit my widescreen 1680&#215;1050 Samsung display, I was firing up Internet Explorer to download <a href="http://firefox.com/">Mozilla Firefox</a>, <a href="http://gimp.org/">The Gimp</a>, <a href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> and <a href="http://openoffice.org/">OpenOffice.org</a>. I still find it thrilling that Windows has such a fantastic assortment of powerful, capable, reliable and high calibre Free and Open Source software available for it that&#39;s completely unmatched on any other platform.</p>

<cite>My fresh Vista desktop, with Mozilla Firefox installed in the Quick Launch bar</cite></p>
<p>As excruciatingly painful as it is for me to admit this; using Vista for a few hours, checking out the new Windows Explorer, the new layout of the Start Menu and the Control Panelâ€¦ I must begrudgingly say that I&#39;m enjoying the experience (pun intended!) more than I thought. The new Aero interface is quite pretty and leaves <a href="http://kde.org/announcements/4.0/desktop.php">KDE 4.0&#39;s</a> and <a href="http://www.compiz-fusion.org/">Compiz Fusion&#39;s</a> graphical effects in the dust; Mac OS X Leopard still looks better but it just uses so many system resources in comparison to Vista&#39;s visual effects I figure it&#39;s just not worth it.</p>
<p>Because this isn&#39;t a laptop I can&#39;t comment on Vista&#39;s battery life or wireless connectivity capabilities, but from a desktop perspective it&#39;s pretty good. I&#39;d be hesitant to say I&#39;m ready to give up FreeBSD on all my desktops, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll keep Vista around on this primary machine.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more screenshots and compatibility reports.</p>
