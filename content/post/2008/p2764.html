<p>As I said in my previous post about <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p2595/">running NetBSD&#39;s pkgsrc on Mac OS X</a>, I hurriedly created a couple of desktop backgrounds for a fellow student and MacBook Pro user a few months ago who has since moved her entire machine over to NetBSD. It should have probably just stayed on my anime and show blog but I figure it&#39;s tech enough to put here.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> While I dabbled in Red Hat Linux 5.x at the time, NetBSD was the first Unix-like operating system I really used. I personally have since moved over to FreeBSD on my desktops, but NetBSD still holds a special place with me. And I am still an avid user of pkgsrc!</p></blockquote>
<p>The orange flower is a photo I took from my <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/sets/72157607804492568/">wildflower photoset around Mawson Lakes</a> here in Adelaide, Mai Tokiha is the protagonist from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_HiME">My-HiME anime series</a> which I have yet to watch but he thinks is trippy, and the logo is of course from the <a href="http://netbsd.org/">NetBSD Project</a>. This was one of the only combinations of orange things I could find on such short notice; had her presentation been a few weeks later I could have probably created something a bit better!</p>
<p>The resolution is 1440&#215;900, but if you&#39;re a NetBSD desktop user, or a pkgsrc on Mac OS X (or Slackware, or Draco Linux, orâ€¦) user on a MacBook it would scale down just fine on 1280&#215;800 too.</p>
