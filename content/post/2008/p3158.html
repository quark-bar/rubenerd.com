<p>I love clouds, and taking photos of clouds because no two skies are ever the same. Some have said it&#39;s a silly thing to do, but having my hobbies labelled as silly hasn&#39;t stopped me in the past and that&#39;s not going to change any time soon!</p>
<p>I never used to upload my cloud photos on my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/">Flickr gallery</a> because I figured most people wouldn&#39;t be interested in such images, but I&#39;ve caved in and started an <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/sets/72157609925168980/">I Heart Clouds</a> gallery. Here are the two I took earlier this afternoon in Adelaide:</p>
