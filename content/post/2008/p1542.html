<blockquote><p>Someone to care for, To be there for;<br />
I have James Woods!</p>
<p>Someone to do for, Mortal through for;<br />
You have James Woods!</p>
<p>Someone to share, Joy and despair with;<br />
Whichever betides you;<br />
Life becomes a chore, Unless you’re living for…</p>
<p>Someone to tend to, Be a friend to;<br />
I have James Woods!</p>
<p>Someone to strive for, Do or die for;<br />
You have James Woods!</p>
<p>It’s true, We two,<br />
Have a likewise point of view;</p>
<p>‘Coz James Woods has you,<br />
And I have James Woods… too!</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#39;ve had your fill of James Woods, may I suggest you build a <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1325/">barbecue pit instead</a>.</p>
