<p>It&#39;s been just under a fortnight now since my sister, dad and I came back from our Sydney trip. Obviously the main reason for going was for <a href="http://rubenerd.com/debra-schade-mummys-funeral/">mummy&#39;s funeral</a>, but we tried to do other things while we were there too.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve taken stacks of photos and haven&#39;t really organised any of them very well but I&#39;m taking some time tomorrow to filter through them and get some up here and on my Flickr profile. I could shoehorn all of them onto one post, but for your sanity and mine I&#39;ll be splitting them up.</p>

<cite>I hate posts without any pictures. Here&#39;s a photo I took of the legendary Oak and Hungry Jacks rest stop sign on the highway between Sydney and Taree.</cite></p>
<p>I&#39;ll also be doing another <a href="http://rubenerdshow.com/">Rubenerd Show</a> early this week, not sure if I should talk about mum or whether I&#39;ve already said enough here. Either way, I have some cool stories and funny stuff to share, as I hope I always do! Cheers.</p>
