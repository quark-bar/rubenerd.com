<p>I&#39;m sorry, I just couldn&#39;t help myself posting a screenshot of this Finder window this afternoon. Could you imagine transferring that much data through USB 2.0? Yuk!</p>
<p>I guess their argument would be that I&#39;m a MacBook Pro user and not the target market for the MacBook. It&#39;s a shame because I&#39;ve always wanted to return to a <a href="http://www.apple.com/sg/macpro/">souped up desktop</a> and a <a href="http://www.apple.com/sg/macbook/">smaller, more lightweight notebook computer</a> combo again at some point, just like I used to have with my PowerMac G5 and my <a href="//rubenerd.com/my-beautiful-ibook-is-working-again/">iBook G3</a>.</p>
<p>I think I&#39;ll be sticking with <a href="http://www.apple.com/sg/macbookpro/">MacBook Pros</a> now. Well look at that, their tactic worked!</p>
