<p>For those interested, my fabulous sister Elke has not only started using <a href="http://twitter.com/elkeee">Twitter</a> again, but she has <a href="http://lettuth.wordpress.com/">started a weblog of her own</a> over on WordPress.com. The embarrasing thing is she&#39;s doing a better job than I am already.</p>
<p>You can find her at <strong><a href="http://lettuth.wordpress.com/">http://lettuth.wordpress.com/</a></strong>. The name was inspired by her favourite image from <a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/2008/05/13/funny-pictures-ah-hath-ah-lethuth/">I Can Has Cheezburger</a>. I&#39;ve been told that site has images of cats, or weasels, or other furry animals having serious intellectual discussions.</p>
