<p>For those who follow the developments over on <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Whole Wheat Radio</a>, the queen of the airwaves <a href="http://esthergolton.com/">Esther Golton</a> has just arrived back from her latest musical tour!</p>

<p>I know I speak for all the wheaties, wheatheads and wheatypeoples when I say it&#39;s good to have you back, and we&#39;re all looking forward to hearing your voice again from time to time on the morning shows with Jim. Cheers from Singapore!</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know about Whole Wheat Radio, it&#39;s an online radio station produced in Talkeetna Alaska, in the States. They play only independent music, and have a thriving listener community which I&#39;m proud to be a part of. You can rate songs you hear, you can edit their wiki pages and if you listen in for long enough you might hear Jim and Esther speaking live :).</p>
