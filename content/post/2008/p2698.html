<cite>The gorgeous herrie audio player with Whole Wheaty goodness</cite></p>
<p>If you had read my previous post on internet streaming (<em><a href="//rubenerd.com/p2602/">Even more woes with streaming internet audio</a></em>) you would know that I&#39;ve been having difficulties listening to streaming internet audio. You could even say I&#39;ve been having woes with it.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the scenario: I could not listen to the <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/">Whole Wheat Radio</a> audio streams at home on my MacBook Pro, however if I took said computer to any of the net cafes in the city, I could. As I surmised in the aforementioned post, I figured it must have therefore been an issue with either our router or our ISP.</p>
<p>It turns out that in fact I am capable of listening to Whole Wheat Radio at home by using their high quality audio feed. I had always stuck to the low and medium fidelity feeds in the past because ISPs in Australia have download caps (yuk!), and a 20GiB monthly allowance disappears faster than you can say <em>&quot;Oh Wow, Obama Is President!&quot;</em> I assume this is because of the different software in play (ha!) on this stream compared to the others.</p>
<p>All I had to do was disconnect our router and plug our ADSL modem directly into our cute little ethernet switch, then manually assign IP addresses and DNS servers to our laptops. I assume then that this must have been an issue with this router.</p>
<p>So as you can see in the screenshot above, I can now play Whole Wheat Radio at home again! The software pictured is <a href="http://herrie.info/">herrie</a>, a very lightweight and easy to use terminal based audio player that uses a fraction of the system resources of QuickTime or iTunes on Mac; and Exaile or Amarok on Unix-like systems… perfect for tuning into an audio feed. I hope to do a review of it alongside the player it replaced called <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Moc">MOC</a> which replaced <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Cmus">Cmus</a>. I&#39;m passionate about finding the right software for the right job, and I&#39;m not a believer in sacrificing a user experience just so you can use two features of one application instead of using two applications.</p>
<p>Look out Jim, another random media player listening to your media again and confusing the What&#39;s Playing page… he doesn&#39;t look too impressed.</p>
