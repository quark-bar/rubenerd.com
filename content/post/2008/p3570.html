<p>Another day goes by, another group of people have a negative opinion of the Great Australian Firewall that Senator Conroy is so desperate to implement. It&#39;s got to the stage where even the American Slashdot website has an article almost every other day about it.</p>
<p>This afternoon, chief operating officer Greg Winn of Australia&#39;s largest telco Telstra has compared attempts to filter the internet to boiling the ocean. <a href="http://www.australianit.news.com.au/story/0,24897,24755150-15306,00.html">According to the IT section of the Australian newspaper</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My view on that is that’s like trying to boil the ocean … to think that you’re going to be able to centrally filter everything, I think that’s a pipe dream,&#8221; Mr Winn told reporters and analysts yesterday.</p>
<p>Child protection agencies have welcomed the Government’s move to filter the internet but civil libetarians, ISPs and the technical community have rallied against it for various reasons.</p>
<p>Mr Winn agreed with broad comments from the ISP community that internet filtering would make surfing the web a slower process.</p>
<p>&#8220;The one thing I do know is that once you start filtering, then you’re going to add latency no matter what,&#8221; he said.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And it seems when asked, Senator Conroy babbled on incessantly in Parliament in a typical attempt to avoid the question. This would be hilarious if it weren&#39;t so tragic.</p>
<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Communications Minister Stephen Conroy came under fire this week for failing to reveal details of the trial.</p>
<p>During question time on Wednesday Senator Conroy was asked how many participants would ISPs have to enlist for the live trials to be credible.</p>
<p>South Australian Liberal MP Cory Bernardi also asked if the results of the trials would be independently verified.</p>
<p>Senator Conroy couldn’t provide answers to both questions within the two-minute timeframe provided. </p></blockquote>
