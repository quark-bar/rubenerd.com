<p>In October 2007 <a href="http://rubenerd.com/africans-are-genetically-inferior-codswhallop/">I wrote a brief post</a> on James Watson&#39;s assertion that Africans suffer from economic and social problems because they&#39;re somehow genetically inferior. I believe I used the term <em>&quot;codswhallop&quot;</em>. Well this afternoon I received an email telling me someone else had commented on it.</p>
<blockquote><p>
Black Africans are inferior because of their forefathers who disrespected God.</p>
<p><cite>~ Pavel</cite>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I was going to reply with a video of myself rolling on the floor roaring with laughter, but I didn&#39;t have time to encode and upload the media to YouTube, so I let the ever so eloquent Stewie Griffin from Family Guy do the talking for me.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hilarious! Makes me sad I don’t have much time to talk to you.</p>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/Family_Guy_Stewie_Chat_Total_Idiot_Black_Shirt.jpg" alt="" style="display:inline; height:320px; width:320px;" /></p></blockquote>
<p>I continue to defend comment systems on internet media against the growing public backlash because I still receive (and read) far more constructive, useful, entertaining and friendly replies than I do negative ones. And besides, the negative ones have such ripe comedic value.</p>
