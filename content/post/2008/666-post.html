<p>It&#39;s come time once again to pay tribute to yet another useless <a href="http://rubenerd.com/">Rubenerd Blog</a> milestone, the posting of the wicked, super evil 666th post!</p>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/screenie.blog666.png" alt="" style="height:102px; width:345px" /></p>
<p>Of course if you were reading this weblog almost one year ago to this day (how very eerie), you would have seen that <a href="http://rubenerd.com/dont-look-now/">I already celebrated</a> what I thought at the time to be the publishing of the 666th post with this very silly graphic from Elfen Lied, one of the scariest anime series&#39; I&#39;d ever seen. Come to think of it I never finished watching it for that very reason.</p>

<p>Anyway I realised in <a href="http://rubenerd.com/1000-rubenerd-musings/">another useless Rubenerd Blog milestone post</a> in November last year that WordPress assigns values to all uploaded media not just weblog entries, meaning that the initial 666th post celebration wasn&#39;t actually the 666th post.</p>
<p>So unlike that impostor post, this one is actually the 666th Rubenerd Blog postâ€¦ even though the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/?p=1064">internal post ID is 1064</a>. Have I confused you yet?</p>
