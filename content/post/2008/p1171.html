<p>I was just browsing Wikipedia with a hot cocoa at 04:30. I happened across a picture of Wichita, a city in Kansas in the US, and in my sleep deprived state I thought I was looking at Adelaide, my home city in Australia:</p>

<cite>Adelaide, SA, Australia</cite></p>
<p>Am I the only one who sees a resemblance? The skylines, the fact they&#39;re both built close to one side of a river, both their convention centres are in the middle of town with white roofs… then to top it off their state flags are blue with circular emblem thingys… it is just me isn&#39;t it.</p>
<p>For fun comparison:</p>

<p><cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide">Adelaide</a></cite> is the fifth most populous city in Australia with a population of 1.1 million in 2006, and is the capital and most populous city of the state of South Australia. It is a coastal city situated on the eastern side of Gulf St. Vincent.</p>
<p>Named in honour of Queen Adelaide, the consort of King William IV, the city was founded in 1836 as the planned capital for the only freely-settled British province in Australia. Colonel William Light designed the city in a grid layout, interspaced by wide boulevards and large public squares, and entirely surrounded by parkland.</p>
<p>Adelaide is known for its many festivals as well as for its wine, arts and sports. As South Australia’s seat of government and commercial centre, Adelaide is the site of many governmental and financial institutions. Most of these are concentrated in the city centre along North Terrace and King William Street.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well they may look the same, but they sound somewhat different!</p>

<p><cite><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita%2C_Kansas">Wichita</a></cite>, also known as the Air Capital of the World, is the largest city in the U.S. state of Kansas, as well as a major aircraft manufacturing hub and cultural center. In July of 2006, CNN/Money and Money magazine ranked Wichita ninth on its list of the 10 best big cities to live in the United States.</p>
<p>The city is home to six major aircraft manufacturing companies and McConnell Air Force Base. Wichita is located in South Central Kansas on the Arkansas River, and is the county seat of Sedgwick County. It is also the home of a National Weather Service Forecast Office which serves portions of central, south-central, and southeast Kansas.</p>
<p>The city’s population was 344,284 at the 2000 census, and it was estimated to be 357,698 in the year 2006, making it the 50th largest in the United States.
