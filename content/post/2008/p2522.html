<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/photo.direstraits.jpg" alt="" style="height:240px; width:242px; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px;" /> I&#39;m a huge fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dire_Straits">Dire Straits</a> and of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Knopfler">Mark Knopfler</a>, not only for their catchy and thought provoking songs but also their &quot;unassuming demeanor&quot;… I had an idea of it, but I needed the phrase from Wikipedia. Isn&#39;t Wikipedia just fantastic. If only it could teach me to create decent blog post headings.</p>
<p>Of all their songs, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Investigations">&quot;Private Investigations&quot;</a> has always been a personal favourite because the lyrics can be so easily adapted to fit so many other occupations and situations, in particular these lines from the second and third versus:</p>
<blockquote><p>
You get to meet all sorts… In this line of work.<br />
Treachery and treason… There’s always an excuse for it.<br />
And when I find the reason… I still can’t get used to it.</p>
<p>And what have you got… At the end of the day?<br />
What have you got… To take away?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Jobs and occupations, relationships and family, school and university studies, <strong><em>POLITICS</em></strong>… makes you think. Or at least it makes me think.</p>
<p>Now we just need Dire Straits to pull off a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_the_Fourth_Chord"> independent album like Status Quo did</a> and we&#39;d be in business.</p>
