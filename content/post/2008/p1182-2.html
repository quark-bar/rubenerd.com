<cite>Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam…</cite></p>
<p>Gmail&#39;s spam filters have really been sliding over the last year. I never used to get any spam at all in the inbox folders, now I get half a dozen a day. Take this hilarious message I got this morning:</p>
<blockquote><p>hayyyyy</p>
<p>I havent been introduced to yous but we know a person in comon who handed me your emaile since I just got to city. They informed me youd be down in hooking up with a gorgeous slap of boooty like mine haha. Neways I will not ever get on my email so don’t want to meetup i shall pass you my pics and show i’m as hot as i claim. msg me up on my Yahoo messenger.</p>
<p>so yes just send me a msg to Y! Messenger: NEWGWENNSN</p>
<p>Do not write back to this emaile since i don’t check it. google Yahoo messenger if you dont have it to download it</p>
<p>Later</p></blockquote>
<p>Sorry darling, I don&#39;t swing that way ;-). Obviously our alleged third party didn&#39;t tell you that abbreviated txt speak pisses me off. I&#39;m intrigued as to how you managed to spell &quot;email&quot; as &quot;emaile&quot; though, I can honestly say I&#39;ve never seen it written like that.</p>
