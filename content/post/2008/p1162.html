<p>I&#39;m in the process of writing up a post on my university intranet blog about how I&#39;m addicted to information and some of the tools I use to help me with it, but I figured this <em>particular feature</em> on <em>this particular service</em> was worthy of its own post. Brace yourself: I&#39;ve finally made the switch from <a href="http://bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a> to <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a>! While I still think Bloglines has a marginally better interface, and the <a href="http://beta.bloglines.com/">Bloglines Beta</a> looks promising, I&#39;m really sold on Google Reader&#39;s Shared Items system.</p>

<p>Shared Items allows you to show people exactly what you&#39;re reading. If you&#39;re reading a particular blog entry, news story or Chuck Norris joke in Google Reader and find it interesting, you can click the Share link in the post&#39;s footer and it magically appears on your Shared Items page which you can give people the link for. It&#39;s really <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/09454950261221562208">very long and ugly</a>, so I created a symlink to make it easier (especially for me!) to remember:</p>
<p><a style="font-weight:bold;"  href="//rubenerd.com/googlereader/">//rubenerd.com/googlereader/</a></p>
<p>One particularly important feature they added recently was the ability to change the style of your Shared Items page. Mine now includes a cute fish tank in the header, very useful.</p>
