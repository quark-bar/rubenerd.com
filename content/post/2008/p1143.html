<p>The <a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a> / Google Mail crew seems to have really been hard at work as of late adding features over the last few months including:</p>
<ul>
<li>AIM support</li>
<li>coloured labels</li>
<li>group chat</li>
<li>new emoticons</li>
<li>free IMAP</li>
<li>view images as a slideshow</li>
<li>increased attachment limit</li>
<li>… <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en/about_whatsnew.html">and lots more stuff</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However <a href="http://konqueror.kde.org/">Konqueror</a> (my favourite browser) is still limited to the basic HTML interface. For now it&#39;s perfectly fine though, I still dislike most AJAX and prefer being served static pages anyway, they&#39;re far more reliable and act in a more predictable way.</p>
<p>I just wish there was a way to remove the <em>&quot;you are a second class citizen on our service that we don&#39;t care as much about&quot;</em> message from the top of the screen…</p>
