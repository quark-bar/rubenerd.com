<p>Being a third culture kid who values cosmopolitan ideals over patriotism, humans over nationalities, cultures over borders, language over legal speak and grilled cheese sandwiches over trousers made out of zucchinis, I am proud to call myself a believer in the <a href="http://www.un.org/aboutun/charter/">Charter of the United Nations</a>!</p>
<p><strong>WE THE PEOPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS DETERMINED</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and</li>
<li>to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and</li>
<li>to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintained, and</li>
<li>to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>AND FOR THESE ENDS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and</li>
<li>to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security, and</li>
<li>to ensure, by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest, and</li>
<li>to employ international machinery for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples,</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>HAVE RESOLVED TO COMBINE OUR EFFORTS TO ACCOMPLISH THESE AIMS</strong></p>
