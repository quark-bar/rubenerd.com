<p>It&#39;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day">Remembrance Day</a> in the Commonwealth and Veterans Day in the United States, the 11th of the 11th, and this morning we all here paused for a minute to commemorate the end of World War I, and all those who lost their lives in that war and subsequent conflicts. <em>&quot;Lest We Forget&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>Today though is especially important given it&#39;s the 90th anniversary of when the guns fell silent on the Western Front. Our PM Kevin Rudd gave a speech, quoted from <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/11/11/2416231.htm">ABC News</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has spoken at a ceremony at Canberra’s War Memorial, paying tribute to Australian diggers who served in the Great War and Australian troops still fighting overseas.</p>
<p>Mr Rudd and Opposition Leader Malcom Turnbull laid wreaths at the ceremony.</p>
<p>In his speech, Mr Rudd spoke of his hope for a new century of peace.</p>
<p>&quot;Wars continue and the innocent continue dying. Must every generation go through war to be reminded why there should be no war?</p>
<p>&quot;We have all endured a most bloody century, but let us resolve afresh at the dawn of the new century… that this might be a truly peaceful century&quot;</p>
<p>Mr Rudd spoke of the 100,000 Australian lives lost in wars overseas, in battles at Gallipoli and Fromelles.</p>
<p>&quot;Today these numbers are mind-numbing, they are horrific in their magnitude&quot;</p>
<p>He also paid tribute to Australian allies and all those who have contributed to shaping Australia.</p>
<p>&quot;Today too we honour our friends and our allies who have been with us in the thick of battle.</p>
<p>&quot;Today we remember those who fell, we honour the contribution they have made to this world.</p>
<p>&quot;We commit ourselves afresh to the great cause of peace, we honour them&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas today I couldn&#39;t attend any dawn services in Adelaide, but I can remember attending every service while I was in Singapore. Many many Australian and British soldiers lost their lives defending Singapore from the Japanese in World War II; many are now buried at the war memorial in Kranji.</p>
<p>It&#39;s now 2008 and we&#39;re still fighting each other. The only two things that have changed are our technology and our justifications. I&#39;d love to be as hopeful as Kevin Rudd that we will have a century of peace, but if the first 8 years of this new century are anything to go by, we haven&#39;t learned our lessons at all.</p>
