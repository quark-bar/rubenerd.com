<cite>That&#39;s a big hot dog! Why did I put this here?</cite></p>
<p><a href="http://elliottback.com/wp/archives/2008/07/31/nsa-true-feelings-meme/">Elliot C. Back clued me onto a NSA test</a> which required people to finish a list of incomplete sentences. Looked like some fun, so here I go:</p>
<ol>
<li>I always wanted to be <strong><em>as artistic as my mum</em></strong></li>
<li>I can’t stop <strong><em>programming, living and drinking coffee</em></strong></li>
<li>If my father would only <strong><em>take me on more of his business trips!</em></strong></li>
<li>People think of me as <strong><em>an introvert who likes coffee</em></strong></li>
<li>I suffer most from <strong><em>a lack of coffee</em></strong></li>
<li>What upsets me most is <strong><em>decaf coffee</em></strong></li>
<li>Most men <strong><em>can’t pick the difference between nail polishes, including me</em></strong></li>
<li>My family treats me like <strong><em>a 24 technical support hotline!</em></strong></li>
<li>My greatest worry is <strong><em>that I worry too much</em></strong></li>
<li>Some members of the opposite sex <strong><em>don’t understand &quot;nerd&quot; is cute</em></strong></li>
<li>Most women <strong><em>are more accepting of bear hugs</em></strong></li>
<li>I regret <strong><em>that my Deutsch still isn’t very strong</em></strong></li>
<li>The main thing in life <strong><em>is coffee, computers and comedy!</em></strong></li>
<li>Secretly <strong><em>I like Barry White music</em></strong></li>
<li>If my mother would only <strong><em>still be alive</em></strong></li>
<li>I don’t like people who <strong><em>assume I paid the Asian girl walking next to me!</em></strong></li>
<li>I wish I could forget the time <strong><em>I fell down two flights of stairs</em></strong></li>
<li>When troubled <strong><em>I watch Japanese television shows</em></strong></li>
<li>It bothers me that I <strong><em>worry too much</em></strong></li>
<li>What angers me most is <strong><em>when people don’t laugh during my standup acts!</em></strong></li>
</ol>
