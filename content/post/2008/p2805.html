<p>Another very eventful day with technology. Today for no reason our home ADSL connection refuses to connect at all. It reaffirms my position on two key things: Australian internet sucks, and ADSL sucks. I&#39;ve never had positive experiences with either!</p>
<p>This is why dear Senator Conroy, I ask for you to stop your fruitless crusade <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/p2421/">to filter and censor the internet</a> which will only end in embarrassing failure for you, and instead work on improving Australia&#39;s aging telecommunications infrastructure like you&#39;re supposed to. Thank you.</p>
