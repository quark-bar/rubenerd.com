<p>Good afternoon everyone, thank you for your time. I would like to address this post to a select few of my friends on my (sadly neglected) Facebook profile.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentleman, you can check under the Info tab on my profile page that I am currently in Adelaide. This is of course bound to change, but you can rest assured that for well over half the year now this is where I am.</p>
<p>I would ask those of you who choose to include me in bulk sent Facebook mail messages for crigeworthy performers such as the Pussycat Dolls in Singapore to please refrain for two principal reasons. One, I hate bands like that, and if you knew me for even five minutes you&#39;d know this. Secondly, I am not in Singapore, so telling me about musicical events (and performers such as the Pussycat Dolls really are pushing the term) that are taking place there is an absolute waste of time.</p>
<p>I trust you will ignore this message.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,<br />
<cite>Ruben Michael Schade the First</cite></p>
