<cite>Photo I took of the Perth skyline a few months ago. The dark building with what looks like a pyramid on top is the headquarters of BankWest.</cite></p>
<p>News is flying around Australia today of the Commonweath Bank&#39;s buying of BankWest, a West Australian bank owned by the British HBOS group. As a result, the expansion of new branches into the eastern states will cease according to an <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/10/08/2385515.htm">ABC News report</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
The chief executive of the Commonwealth Bank, Ralph Norris, has confirmed that the rollout of BankWest branches on the east coast will stop as a result of the $2 billion takeover.</p>
<p>Mr Norris has described BankWest as a leader in the growing Western Australian market and a good investment for CBA shareholders.</p>
<p>Mr Norris says there will be no closures of both Commonwealth or BankWest branches and businesses in Western Australia as a result of the acquisition.</p>
<p>Last year, BankWest launched a program to open 160 branches nationwide, but today Mr Norris said he will review BankWest operations in the east.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would suggest that the branch rollout would cease,&#8221; he said.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Given Australia&#39;s banks are in good shape and the British banks are suffereing as a result of the subprime mortgage crisis, I suspected the buyout was just a result of opportunistic buying. The last line in an ABC News report said it all though:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr Norris says a merged BankWest-CBA will be bigger than the Westpac-St George entity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Aha! This is just a tactic so you can keep calling yourselves number 1 after Westpac buys St George and BankSA! You shrewd, shrewd bankers ;-).</p>
