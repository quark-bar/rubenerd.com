<p>On Saturday the 29th of December 2007 some of our closest friends and dear family from all across Australia congregated at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;time=&#038;date=&#038;ttype=&#038;q=Woronora&#038;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&#038;sspn=99.143026,114.082031&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;ll=-33.979239,151.091537&#038;spn=0.437294,0.445633&#038;t=h&#038;z=11&#038;om=1">Woronora in Sydney, Australia</a> for my mummy&#39;s funeral. It was a beautiful service with lots of flowers, plenty of her favourite music playing and some sweet and heartfelt tributes from Ted and Margaret, my dad Rainer, Sharon, Megan and Lynn.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t think of a single moment in my life where I have cried more or felt so much grief, but I also laughed and remembered all the great times we had together and enjoyed talking to so many people, some of whom I hadn&#39;t seen in over a decade, about mummy and her incredible life.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve already thanked everyone I could see while I was there, but I wanted for the record to make a note of it here. Thank you to everyone who attended, thank you to all the people in my fabulous family for helping to organise the celebration and thank you to all my friends from school and university, to my teachers (well, <strong><em>most</em></strong> of my teachers!) and to everyone here on my website and on Twitter for all your love, help and support during these long, trying 12 years. I couldn&#39;t have done it without you guys.</p>
<p>I love you mummy.</p>
