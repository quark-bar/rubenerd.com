<p>For the longest time I&#39;ve resisted putting a donate button or a tip jar on any of my sites because I feel there are so many more legitimate and worthwhile causes out there that people should be donating money to. While this is still definitely true, I decided this morning to finally give it a small shot, but instead of just asking people for a handout or for huge sums of money, I thought I&#39;d put a bit more thought into it.</p>
<p>So here&#39;s the deal, if you&#39;ve enjoyed reading some of the material I&#39;ve typed up here on this blog whatsit, feel free to click the &quot;Buy Ruben a Coffee :-)&quot; image on the right hand side of any page on the <a href="//rubenerd.com/">Rubenerd Blog</a> site. If you buy me a cup of coffee using PayPal, that&#39;s less money I need to transfer from my bank account to pay online bills such as hosting, which in turn I&#39;ll be able to use to buy myself a cup of coffee instead!</p>
<p>With all the studying and working I&#39;m frantically doing to catch up after taking a longer break than I had originally planned for family reasons, the time I spend on this blog as well as <a href="//rubenerd.comshow.com/">my internet talk radio show</a> is a pleasant distraction and a great thing to do. If I&#39;ve created something that others find interesting and useful, I feel I&#39;ve also managed to at least accomplish something meaningful and worthwhile :-).</p>
<p>If you would like to donate more than AU$4.00, might I suggest <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/">Whole Wheat Radio</a>, the <a href="//rubenerd.com/p1875/">World Food Programme</a> or the <a href="http://www.nccs.com.sg/donation/index.htm">National Cancer Centre of Singapore</a> whom my family are forever indebted to for their service. They deserve money more than I do. Thank you.</p>
