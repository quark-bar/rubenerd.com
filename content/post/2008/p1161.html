<p>Ever wanted your own custom designed neon tube sign?</p>
<p><a href="http://atlanticneon.com/custom%20Neon%20Clocks.htm"><img src="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/atlantic.neon.dont.worry.clock.jpg" alt="Atlantic Neon custom neon clock" style="width:320px; height:286px" /></a></p>
<p>Is it just me, or does that sign look like it was taken right out of a set from Happy Days? No wait, the face looks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro-futurism">retro futuristic</a>. Whatever it is, I want it!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> Wish I had found that image less than 20 minutes ago, it would have perfect for a post on <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/p1160/">NFS time synchronising</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what I&#39;m <em>really</em> interested in is their colour glass wall cubes. Anyone interested in buying me two dozen?</p>

<p>They&#39;re creations of Jake Rosenfield of the <a href="http://atlanticneon.com/">Atlantic Neon Company</a> based in Baltimore, Maryland in the States. He&#39;s also got some <a href="http://atlanticneon.com/About%20Atlantic%20Neon.htm">great photos of his workshop</a> on his site.</p>
