<p><a href="http://wordle.net/">Wordle</a> is a Java web application that intelligently generates gorgeous word clouds from text you provide, sans common English words. It can be an RSS or Atom feed from a website, a generic webpage or even just a slab of text you enter in yourself. It is a brilliant way to visualise what someone has been talking about.</p>
<p>My <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/">RSS feed</a> for the Rubenerd Blog is configured to share the last 40 items, so this is a Wordle for these said items:</p>

<p>If you have never heard of Wordle before, I must warn you against using it. Not only is it terribly addictive but it will take up your entire afternoon. You&#39;ll even start creating Wordles for other people&#39;s sites; this Wordle is for my list of artists from my <a href="wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Category:Rubenerd%27s_music_to_explore">Music to Explore</a> on <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Whole Wheat Radio</a>:</p>
