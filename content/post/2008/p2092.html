<p>Thinking about it now it does seem silly to start a post that merely points people to the comments on a previous post, but to be frank I never knew my post <a href="//rubenerd.com/p2062/">Okay I admit it, I like the USA</a> would generate <a href="//rubenerd.com/p2062/#respond">so many responses</a>. Most warm and positive, some extremely negative!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve attempted to address all the comments, especially with regards to lax regulations, privatisation and world citizenship. Suffice to say I&#39;m glad it&#39;s Saturday evening and I actually have time to do so! Feel free to <a href="//rubenerd.com/p2062/#respond">join in the discussion</a>, and to let me know why I don&#39;t know anything about economics or systems of government.</p>
