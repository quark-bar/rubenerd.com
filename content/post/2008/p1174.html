<blockquote><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> In fact I’m now trialling <a href="http://xfce.org/">Xfce</a> once again for my primary desktop because it satisfies <em>all</em> the criteria I outlined below as well as GNOME does, while being much more light weight.</p>
<p>It’s funny, I’m really only this fickle when it comes to software!</p></blockquote>
<p>With a somewhat heavy heart and conscience I moved my primary desktop from <a href="http://kde.org/">KDE</a> to <a href="http://gnome.org/">GNOME</a> this week.</p>
<p><a href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.gnome.cc.png"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.gnome.cc.thumb.jpg" alt="My GNOME desktop" style="height:313px; width:500px;" /></a><br />
<cite>Yes, that&#39;s CC from Code Geass, the anime series <a href="http://ftanjono.tumblr.com/">Felix</a> and I are watching!</cite></p>
<p>While I think I still prefer KDE as a desktop environment, I think Gnome is more practical for what I do right now. Aside from <a href="http://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a> and <a href="http://ktorrent.org/">Ktorrent</a>, virtually all the applications I use on a daily basis are <em><a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+</a> based</em>, such as <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gnumeric/">Gnumeric</a>, <a href="http://www.abisource.com/">Abiword</a>, <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">The Gimp</a>, <a href="http://www.gnucash.org/">Gnucash</a>, <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/gedit/">gEdit</a>, <a href="http://thunar.xfce.org/index.html">Thunar</a> (from <a href="http://xfce.org/">Xfce</a>, another nice DE), <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/">Thunderbird</a>… I could go on.</p>
<p>It is really nice to have a consistent user interface for the first time, where my applications and the desktop work and look the same. Having used GTK+ applications on KDE and Mac OS X for many, many years, it&#39;s certainly a refreshing experience.</p>
<p><a href="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.gnome.gtkapps.png"><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/screenie.gnome.gtkapps.thumb.jpg" alt="GTK apps running in GNOME" style="height:313px; width:500px;" /></a><br />
<cite>Too many GTK+ apps running in GNOME</cite></p>
<p>On the whole I also prefer the simple design methodology behind a lot of what the GNOME people are doing. Despite Linus Torvald&#39;s <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/usability/2005-December/msg00021.html">vocal opposition</a> to it, I believe working hard to make interfaces simpler is an admiral goal.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve still got KDE 3.5.9 on my Athlon XP desktop, but I guess I could say I&#39;m a GNOME user now. For what it&#39;s worth, this is another reason why I love using free and open source software, if I don&#39;t like a particular user interface or environment, or I choose to use a another one, it is completely in my power to just slot in a different one. It&#39;s fantastic!</p>
