<p>With my birthday in less than a day, my dad gave me his credit card to buy some music from CDBaby with the <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Whole Wheat Radio</a> affiliate links. I didn&#39;t have to pay for the CDs, he gets to give me something I like without having to work too hard, we both win. Plus it makes at least a small dent in my <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/wiki/index.php/Category:Rubenerd's_music_to_explore">music to explore list</a>!</p>

<p>The best thing about buying from CDBaby though is the email receipt they send you afterwards :-).</p>
<blockquote><p>
Ruben &#8211;<br />
Thanks for your order with CD Baby!</p>
<p>Your CDs have been gently taken from our CD Baby shelves with sterilized contamination-free gloves and placed onto a satin pillow.</p>
<p>A team of 50 employees inspected your CDs and polished them to make sure they were in the best possible condition before mailing.</p>
<p>Our packing specialist from Japan lit a candle and a hush fell over the crowd as he put your CDs into the finest gold-lined box that money can buy.</p>
<p>We all had a wonderful celebration afterwards and the whole party marched down the street to the post office where the entire town of Portland waved &#8220;Bon Voyage!&#8221; to your package, on its way to you, in our private CD Baby jet on this day, Monday, March 24th.</p>
<p>I hope you had a wonderful time shopping at CD Baby.  We sure did. Your picture is on our wall as &#8220;Customer of the Year.&#8221;  We’re all exhausted but can’t wait for you to come back to CDBABY.COM!!</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you, thank you!</p>
<p>Sigh…<br />
Derek Sivers, president, CD Baby
