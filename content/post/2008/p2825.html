<p>For the remainder of this week I&#39;ll be using an image of poppies for my blog and show header backgrounds to <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p2808/">remember the 90th anniversary of the end of World War I</a>, and to remember those who have died in that war and subsequent wars, and for those they left behind.</p>
