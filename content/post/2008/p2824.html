<p>It&#39;s been an eventful few weeks in Adelaide. A few weeks ago it was a bomb scare in a bank in the CBD, now I&#39;ve just received a text message from my sister that there&#39;s a severe gas leak on North Terrace: there are ambulances, fire trucks and police cars swarming everywhere!</p>
<p>UPDATE: It was discussed on Seven&#39;s 6pm news a few minutes ago, I recorded it and <a href="http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=9JCp-vpSNyU">uploaded the video on YouTube</a>:</p>

<p>And other Australians sometimes accuse Adelaide of being the <em>&quot;boring&quot;</em> state capital… can you believe it?</p>
