<p>One of the great things about being a regular <a href="http://twitter.com/Rubenerd">Twitter user</a> is that you&#39;re exposed to so many great ideas from such a diverse group of people which you can use to form your own theories and as a basis for deep thought and philosophy.</p>

<blockquote><p>Just watched a guy using pro level cam equipment pointing his flash backwards blinding all the people behind him everytime he took pics.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pure genius! Now if you&#39;d excuse me, I&#39;m off to purchase a professional flash rig.</p>
