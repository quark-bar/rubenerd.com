<p>Instead of a not so stylish Designed for Windows sticker I&#39;ve been looking for a Powered by FreeBSD or Powered by BSD or Daemon Powered or something to that nature to put next to the Intel Inside sticker on my new built PC.</p>
<p>If you can&#39;t wait for the FreeBSD Mall beastie sticker to arrive, there are quite a lot of good little graphics floating around that you could theoretically print onto photo sticker paper :)</p>

<p>No prizes for guessing my favourite one!</p>
