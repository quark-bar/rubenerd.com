<p>My attempts to play streaming online audio on this internet connection continue to fail. This afternoon I received an error in herrie (via pkgsrc) though that I hadn&#39;t seen before when I tried playing the low fidelity <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/">Whole Wheat Radio</a> audio stream. MOC (via MacPorts) gave a similar error. QuickTime and iTunes blankety refuse to play.</p>
<p>I&#39;m really starting to think this a problem with either our router or even at the ISP end. I&#39;ll go to Internode on Wednesday.</p>
