<blockquote><p><strong>WARNING:</strong> I didn’t make any of these facts up, these are all true facts that I’m submitting as part of my application to become a Singaporean and/or Australian overseas representative of the American Federal Bureau of Miscellaneous Information.</p></blockquote>
<p>In light of my recent purchase of <a href="//rubenerd.com/p2962/">David Letterman&#39;s Late Show Fun Facts</a>, I&#39;ve been inspired to relay some Fun Facts of my own. I&#39;m nothing compared to Dave and his writers, but the one advantage I do have is being able to use hyperlinks to point people to relevant information. Think of this as a knockoff HyperCard version of the magnificently written Late Show Fun Facts.</p>
<p>Here are 10 Rubenerd Fun Facts to get us started. This could turn into a series (I can hear <a style="text-decoration:line-through;" href="http://intoyourhead.com/">Neil</a> <a href="http://intoyourhead.com/">Neil</a> groaning!).</p>
