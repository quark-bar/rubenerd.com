<cite>The Pownce export notice on the Settings page</cite></p>
<p>Last week I talked about the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p3524/">closure of Pownce</a>, my <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p3540/">last message on Pownce</a>, and the fact I had used the new <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p3533/">export feature on Pownce</a>. I&#39;m only two sentences into this post and I&#39;ve used the word Pownce three times. No wait, four times. Including the title, five times. Wait, I forgot the image above: seven times. Pownce.</p>
<p>This afternoon I finally received my long awaited and highly anticipated email letting me know my data was exported and ready for download.</p>
<blockquote><p>Your export files are complete.</p>
<p>You may download your files at:<br />
<a href="http://pownce.com/settings/export/">http://pownce.com/settings/export/</a></p>
<p>Please stop by as soon as possible to pick up your files. Once Pownce is closed, on December 15, these files will no longer be available.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />

<p>There&#39;s just one problem; upon clicking the aforementioned link and logging in, I&#39;m presented with the alien error page instead!</p>

<p>I guess they&#39;re dealing with a lot of traffic this afternoon, or morning, or whatever time it is. I don&#39;t understand time zones. I mean I understand them, I&#39;ve just never been able to wrap my head around how someone on one side of the planet can be experiencing a completely different time of day to myself. It makes sense without making any sense if that makes any more sense.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still trying to decide what I&#39;ll use my exported Pownce file for. Could you imagine if all the hundreds of Pownce messages were imported into this blog, one message per post? What a deliciously disastrous and utterly unusable idea :). I guess I could create a sub category to contain them, and have them not appear in any RSS feeds except for that category feed.</p>
