<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/yuki.mouse.gif" alt="Say what?" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px; width:240px; height:360px;" /> To make life easier I&#39;m changing a lot of the plumbing behind the Show, my blog and my consulting and uni notes blogs over the next few weeks to integrate them, so I only have one site to maintain instead of four. With all the stuff going on in my life right now, keeping all this stuff up to date and seperate is not really workable!</p>
<p>So therefore vis a vis ergo wysiwyg I&#39;ll be archiving and closing the forum soon :-(. If you&#39;d like to post comments about a show (or absolutely any damned thing you want!) please click the <em>Post Comment</em> link at the bottom of the latest show. If you&#39;ve had an approved comment once before it should automatically be posted without the waiting period.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for your listenership! Listenership <em>is</em> a word right?</p>
