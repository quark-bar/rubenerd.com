<p>After the many troubles I encountered with running <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>, Windows XP and <a href="http://apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X Leopard</a> in a triple boot configuration on my venerable Core Duo MacBook Pro (<a href="//rubenerd.com/p2377/">Brief flirtation with FreeBSD on my MacBook Pro is over</a>) I thought while I had some time this afternoon I&#39;d try using <a href="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD</a> instead.</p>
<p>The preliminary result? The experiment was a success! I have <a href="http://netbsd.org/releases/formal-4/NetBSD-4.0.1.html">NetBSD 4.0.1</a> booting beautifully alongside Windows XP and Mac OS X Leopard without any of the problems FreeBSD 7.0 seemed to have, such as the persistent and downright bizarre several minute long stalling boot times for the system and for Xorg.</p>
<p>As I&#39;ve said before, NetBSD was the first Unix-like system I really took seriously after only toying around with Red Hat Linux in the late 1990s. I moved all my non-Mac machines over to FreeBSD due to FreeBSD&#39;s better graphics support and its generally higher levels of use which translates into more online documentation and such, but I&#39;ve always had a soft spot for NetBSD.</p>
<p>I feel as though I&#39;m reacquainting myself with an old friend, plus all my experimenting with pkgsrc on Mac OS X (<a href="//rubenerd.com/p2595/">Notes on using NetBSDâ€™s pkgsrc on Mac OS X</a>) means I already know the ins and out of package management on it too. Stay tuned for further developments.</p>
