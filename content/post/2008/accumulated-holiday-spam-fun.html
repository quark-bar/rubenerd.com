<p>It&#39;s amazing how much work, studies and other assorted whatnot accumulates when you disconnect yourself <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internets">from the internets</a> &#91;sic&#93;.</p>
<p>Case in point: silly, unauthorised, supposed erection assisting or lottery winning, mismatched, bulk emails! When I returned <a href="//rubenerd.com/debra-schade-mummys-funeral/">from my family&#39;s trip to Sydney for mummy&#39;s funeral</a>, this was the screen I was welcomed with:</p>

<p>The problem is, I used to be able to just hit the Clear button with Akismet, but lately it&#39;s been generating so many false positives I have to comb through the pages to make sure legitimate comments haven&#39;t been filtered out by accident. Of course I usually check comments every day so combing through a few dozen is no problem, but letting it accumulate like this is a real nightmare!</p>
<p>So just to let people know, if you&#39;ve posted a comment and it hasn&#39;t been approved yet, you can understand why it might take a while.</p>

<p>I used to be under the impression that spambots just posted to everything they could get their hands on, but it seems they&#39;re drawn to certain articles. Some of them clearly don&#39;t make sense, especially the ones which attempt to hijack articles <strong><em>where I&#39;ve talked about spam!</em></strong></p>
<p>So just for interest&#39;s sake (hope Mr. Interest is okay with me using him in this example) here are a microscopic selection of posts which seem to attract the most spam messages, <strong><em>with the titles copied verbatim</em></strong>.</p>
