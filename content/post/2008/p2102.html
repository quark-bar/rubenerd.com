<cite>Photo of mine <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd/sets/72157607804492568/">from Flickr</a> of the Mawson Lakes river</cite></p>
<p>From <a href="http://twitter.com/jerrynovak/">Jerry Novak&#39;s</a> Twitter feed:</p>
<blockquote><p>I finally figured out the only reason to be alive is to enjoy it.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good enough reason for me :-).</p>
<p>Jerry is so far the only Overnightscapean I&#39;ve met in person, when he visited Singapore last year. Well, that&#39;s if you don&#39;t count Felix Tanjono who I went to high school with in Singapore! I think it&#39;s safe to say certain similar tragic events in both our lives around the same time brought us together as brothers, even if I&#39;ve only met him in person a few times.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, if there were more people like Jerry the world would be a damned better place.</p>
