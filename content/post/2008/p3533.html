<cite>The Pownce export notice on the Settings page</cite></p>
<p>Shortly after I blogged about the demise of Pownce (<a href="http://rubenerd.com/p3524">Goodbye Pownce, I Hardly Used Ya</a>), I received an email in my inbox (as opposed to receiving an email in my dishwasher) from the Pownce folk that they&#39;re shutting down. I already knew about this obviously, but what I didn&#39;t know was that they were kind enough to offer an export feature so our data won&#39;t become dust in the wind when they finally go offline:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are sad to announce that Pownce is shutting down on December 15, 2008. As of today, Pownce will no longer be accepting new users or new pro accounts.</p>
<p>To help with your transition, we have built an export tool so you can save your content. You can find the export tool at Settings > Export. Please export your content by December 15, 2008, as the site will not be accessible after this date.</p>
<p>Please visit our new home to find out more:<br />

<p>Our thanks go out to everyone who contributed to the Pownce community,</p>
<p>The Pownce Crew
</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not as clear cut as they say; unlike <a href="http://delicious.com/rubenerd/">del.icio.us</a> which takes a few hours to generate an exported file, Pownce claims it will take several days to process. Still, once it&#39;s done they will send you an email along with a file which you can use to import into Movable Type, as well as a generic XML file which should be easy enough to import into most other blogging applications.</p>
<p>As I said previously, other than a handful of messages my Pownce posts were just automatic duplicates of posts I was sending to Twitter from my desktop client. Still, the electronic archaeologist in me likes the idea of having a backed up archive of my Pownce account for posterity once it goes offline. Who knows, perhaps my grandchildren will be doing a school report on Kevin Rose at some point in the distant future and I&#39;ll be able to provide them with material from the short lived, mythical Pownce site. Yes, you&#39;d better believe it.</p>
