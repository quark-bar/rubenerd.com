<p>While I&#39;m having a quick break from this work assignment (yes I even work on Sundays for clients, aren&#39;t I dedicated?) I thought I&#39;d post some camera phone photos I took last Wednesday.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/rubenerd">my Flickr page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A gigantic tree fell across Stevens Rd, a major dual carrigeway in Singapore. They had to close the whole side leading away from Orchard!</p></blockquote>

<p>It really was catastrophic, there were cars jammed all down Scotts Road, detour routes were being set up as I walked past, police cars with sirens flying around. I&#39;m not sure if anyone was injured, from where I was walking on the other side of the road I couldn&#39;t see any crushed cars or ambulances which was a relief.</p>
<p>Walking a little further down Stevens Road, I noticed a huge queue of parked public buses that just kept going and going in both lanes.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I like Singapore is that there are so many trees lining all the streets, even right in the centre of the city with huge buildings. I guess these kinds of accidents are inevitable though.</p>
