<p>For a high school assignment back in 2003 I had to demonstrate competency in a spreadsheet application by entering data and creating several charts, or to use the exact language from the assignment sheet: &quot;You must demonstrate competency in a spreadsheet application by entering data and creating several charts&quot;. I used the amount of rewritable computer data capacity I had on hand as my data.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ASIDE:</strong> Before I started using Macs as my primary machines I used Office 97 on my Windows machines. Even in 2003, I saw no compelling reason to use anything newer than Excel 97!</p></blockquote>
<p>Well here we are in 2008 and by chance while I was pouring through my backups trying to find an old text file, I found that old Excel spreadsheet file and was absolutely flabbergasted (is that a word?) by the hard disk sizes! So to put things into perspective I decided to quickly open the file in Gnumeric and add data from my recent drives, and just for fun the data from some of our older machines (I didn&#39;t bother with my dad&#39;s AT or anything older!).</p>
<p><em>File sizes are shown in the hard disk manufacturer&#39;s advertised sizes which assume 1 kilobyte = 1000 bytes</em></p>

<p>And what would these four capacities look like in comparison to each other if they were put into a fun but fairly useless graph?</p>
