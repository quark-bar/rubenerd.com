<p>Looking at my site statistics I&#39;ve discovered that this humble weblog&#39;s <a href="//rubenerd.com.com/feed">web feed</a> has close to 4x the number of unique IP address hits than the <a href="//rubenerd.comshow.com/">Rubenerd Show&#39;s</a> <a href="//rubenerd.comshow.com/feed/">podcast feed</a>. That has really taken me by surprise! And here I was thinking that the Show was the only thing keeping this site interesting, and all the boring stuff would go on the Blog. Perhaps I need to adjust my priorities!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also broken my previous record for bandwidth used, this domain has crunched through 14.3 gigs in one week! That&#39;s probably loose change for most people, but for me it&#39;s a big deal! (<em>Obviously today&#39;s stats are much lower because the day is only half over, but you get the idea</em>).</p>

<p>The countries table surprised me even more! The percentage of people from the States has increased even further, and France is now number 3 with almost twice as many as Singaporeans! Now obviously these stats aren&#39;t 100% reliable given some people&#39;s usage of proxies, onion routing and whatnot, but it&#39;s still fascinating!</p>

<p>What I&#39;m entertaining as some sort of conspiracy though above all else: punching all these numbers into Gnumeric and creating a rough doughnut chart, rotating it 270 degrees and adding the right colour for the main segment creates an image that looks suspiciously like the logo for the late <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_International">Commodore Business Machines</a> corporation:</p>
<p><img src="//rubenerd.com/files/uploads/2008.04.stats.graph.png" alt="" style="width:320px; height:249px;" /></p>
<p>Which then brings up the inevitable question: is a part of a doughnut chart called a segment like a pie chart? Or would it be a bite? Or a byte? Or a Homer Simpson?</p>
