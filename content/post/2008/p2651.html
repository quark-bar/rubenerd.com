<p>I can tell just form reading Twitter and watching video from around the world, that the United States has made the right decision for themselves and for the world. People around the world are celebrating this event. I can see people&#39;s opinions of the US changing almost instantly.</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking forward to this new United States. Let&#39;s heal these wounds and get the world back on track again.</p>
