<blockquote><p>I’ve turned the big Two Two<br />
Just don’t expect me to wear one!</p>
<p>Hey come on, it’s the only time in my life when I’ll be able to say that!</p>

<p>Thank you to all the fabulous people who have emailed me and <a href="http://twitter.com/rubenerd/">Twittered</a> birthday wishes!</p>
<p>I also want to wish Frank Edward Nora&#39;s baby <a href="http://theovernightscape.com/">The Overnightscape</a> a happy birthday too, which happens to fall on this exact same day… synchronicity! If you didn&#39;t read about it, <a href="//rubenerd.com/frank-edward-noras-electronic-makeover/">he overhauled its logo</a> recently too in celebration!</p>
