<p>I was sharing this idea with my father in a series of text messages this morning, and I found it so insightful, constructive and useful I figured I&#39;d share it with all you fine folks this morning. If <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/">SBS</a> are looking for another topic for their <a href="http://news.sbs.com.au/insight/">Insight debate forum programme</a>, they need not look any further.</p>
