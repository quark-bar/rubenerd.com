<p>As I&#39;ve explained before, because of the way WordPress handles elements the ID of a post doesn&#39;t correspond with the number of the post. For example, this post has an ID of <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p2431/">2431</a> despite it being the 912nd post. You can see the disparity by looking at the header of this site itself and seeing the post count in brackets next to the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/archive/">All Posts</a> link.</p>
<p>What I didn&#39;t expect was that given this post is 912, the <a href="http://rubenerd.com/p2421/">previous post</a> was 911. In said post I was talking about ominous and overarching internet censorship in Australia that would put us in the same league as China, North Korea and Iran. Coincidence? Synchronicity? Chuck Peddle?</p>
<p>I am my <a href="http://rainorshine.tumblr.com/">father&#39;s</a> son though: when I think of 911 this is still the first thing that comes to mind.</p>
