Forgive me, I mistyped it in the previous sentence too. I&#39;d be a great comedian if I could form and deliver cohesive jokes.</p>
<p>Upon entering this incorrect information and hitting <code>Return</code>, I was presented not with a page discussing a healthier alternative to beef and other four letter meats (the singular version of which also being a culinary four letter word), but rather an information page on a specific region of Nepal.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prok">Prok</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_Development_Committee">Village Development Committee</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorkha_District">Gorkha District</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandaki_Zone">Gandaki Zone</a> of northern-central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal">Nepal</a>. At the time of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Nepal_census">1991 Nepal census</a> it had a population of 739 and had 219 houses in the village.</p>
<p><cite>&quot;<a href="http://www.digitalhimalaya.com/collections/nepalcensus/form.php?selection=1">Nepal Census 2001</a>&quot;. Nepalâ€™s Village Development Committees. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Himalaya">Digital Himalaya</a>. Retrieved on 2008-08-31.</cite></p></blockquote>
<p>Living in Singapore for so long I always wanted to fly a few short hours to Nepal and just explore; I had more than one conversation with my mum about going there and to Kashmir if ever the fighting there were to calm down at some point in the latter.</p>
<p>And as for referencing pork and Prok in a post which could easily have been explained only in one line instead of six paragraphs, on my blog which is supposed to be about software and the intertubes? I say: you&#39;re welcome. Thank you, and goodnight.</p>
