<blockquote><p>I’m so sorry, hugs from Elke and I. I’ve read what you posted on this site about your mum over the years, she sounded like a upstanding, warm, beautiful and very special person.</p>
<p>Having just lost our mummy recently we know probably the last thing you want to read is sad words, so all we’ll say is that we know you’ve damn well done your mum proud. Have a safe and speedy journey to Ohio, we’ll all keep the Wheaty fires burning until you get back.</p>
<p>Peace and love to you and your family James.</p>
<p>Love Ruben and Elke</p></blockquote>
