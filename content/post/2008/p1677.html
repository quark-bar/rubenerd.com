<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/uploads/200px-BentoXVI-30-10052007.jpg" alt="Pope Benedict XVI during visit to São Paulo, Brazil" style="height:266px; width:200px; float:right; margin:0 0 10px 20px;" /> Does anyone else find the Pope slightly disingenuous <a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/world/pope-paris-money-power-not-only-values">when he espouses</a> the virtues of living for things other than money and power when he is in a position of great power and is the head of an organisation that doesn&#39;t pay taxes?</p>
<p>I got two quite different responses on Twitter, and I replied in two different ways!</p>
<blockquote><p>
And who would they pay taxes to, based on which laws? But there is some irony there, given the treasures held by the Church.<br />

<p>They would pay taxes on their income to the government, just like everyone else does.<br />

<blockquote><p>
Of course religions should pay taxes. I have no idea why the don’t. I wonder what the rationale is?<br />

<p>I think the problem is we both expect them to be rational and make sense right? :-D<br />
