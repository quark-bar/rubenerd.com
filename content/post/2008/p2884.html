<p>Senator Conroy&#39;s decision to implement <a href="http://nocleanfeed.com/">mandatory filers</a> to censor every Australian internet connection is not only a dangerous idea because it will [knowingly] generate false positives, be a threat to free speech and will slow internet access speeds down for everyone, but it will also cost a fortune to install, configure, and maintain, and will also be trivial to bypass to anyone who wants. It&#39;s hard to see how anyone could think this is a good idea, but there you go.</p>
<p>In my own tribute to the veritable waves of cellulose-pulp-based written communications to various local members of parliament across the country, I&#39;ve decided this afternoon to whip up a final letter of my own. I&#39;ve already contacted a few other state and federal ministers, but this is the letter I&#39;ve written for Mr Conroy:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Dear Senator Conroy,</p>
<p>Grow a brain.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Ruben Schade<br />
The Department of Redundancy Department
</p></blockquote>
<p>Funny, my other letters were substantially longer for some reason!</p>
