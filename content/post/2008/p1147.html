<p>Isn&#39;t it oh-so-human-nature to only notice how important something is, or how much it shaped and affected your life, when it&#39;s gone? And isn&#39;t it a shame when some people can&#39;t see it at all?</p>
<p>Case in point for the former, the current outage over at <a href="http://wholewheatradio.org/">Whole Wheat Radio</a> has forced me to temporarily consider other music sources I can listen to over the period of a day in the background while I do studies. It&#39;s a pickle of a dilly.</p>

<p>I tuned into three different terrestrial radio stations: one was playing Fergie (what an insult to ears everywhere!), the second the two DJs were discussing an up and coming concert by a group who can&#39;t sing, and the third was playing a Glenn Miller Orchestra song. At the risk of sounding like an old fart already, take a guess which one I stuck with!</p>
<p>If you&#39;re in Singapore, <a href="http://www.gold90.sg/">Gold 90.5FM</a> is a poor substitute to WWR, but they do play some good stuff. Even if their website sucks harder than an industrial vacuum cleaner! Damn I miss the Wiki.</p>
<p>For some smooth evening chill, also check out <a href="http://www.duddingstonbooks.com/cabaret/">An Evening with Dadaist Cabaret</a>. The shows are long enough to be interesting and full of good stuff, while still being a manageable enough size to fit on an iPod, or whatever other portable audio device you may be using. I&#39;m still waiting for a music wristwatch that&#39;s also a coffee machine. That would be sweet.</p>

<p>For the time being too I&#39;m also listening to my Whole Wheat Radio iTunes playlist which includes all the CDs I&#39;ve got so far from it including Kevin So, Greg Brown, The Philadelphia Jug Band, The Renovators, Guy Clark and hopefully soon Marian Call when the latest parcel arrives! There&#39;s only so many times I can listen to these fine folks mashed up together and on random before it starts to feel like a scaled down WWR though. And what if I want to say hello to Jimbob, Kelli, Atuuschaw, RubenBot5000 (he&#39;s my robot who chats after midnight Singapore time), Sparkit, FlyingTrout and moreâ€¦ damn I feel like some of my family has gone!</p>
<p>Here&#39;s hoping Whole Wheat will be able to get back up soon. Give &#39;em hell Jim!</p>
