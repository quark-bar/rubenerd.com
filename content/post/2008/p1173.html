<p>Despite WordPress assigning this post the ID of <em><a href="//rubenerd.com/p1173/">1173</a></em>, this is post <em>755</em>. It caught my attention because the year 755 was when Zhāng Xuān (張萱) was born, the famous Chinese painter. I remember him really well because of a print we had in our lounge room when I was growing up in Australia, and it just so happens <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Xuan">Wikipedia</a> has a picture of it:</p>
<p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Spring_Outing_of_the_Tang_Court.jpg/500px-Spring_Outing_of_the_Tang_Court.jpg" alt="Spring Outing of the Tang Court" style="width:500px; height:259px" /></p>
<p>Not exactly my cup of tea nowadays, but seeing it was a real nostalgia trip for me.</p>
<p>Does this post count as a <a href="//rubenerd.com/tag/pointless-milestone/">pointless Rubenerd Blog milestone</a>?</p>
