<cite>Mac OS X Leopard Date &amp; Time preference pane showing the Australian Eastern timezone</cite></p>
<p>For those who haven&#39;t installed Mac OS X from scratch before, some of the steps you go through during the process are selecting your country and filling in registration information which optionally includes your address. Despite entering <em>&quot;Adelaide&quot;</em> as my city and <em>&quot;South Australia</em>&quot; as my current state of residence, Mac OS X is still configured to use the Australian Eastern Timezone as shown above.</p>
<p>This has caught me out so many times I can&#39;t count! Fortunately I haven&#39;t missed any classes or meetings as a result of looking at a freshly installed Mac, but the opportunity is still there.</p>
<p>Is it normal for Apple software to just choose the most populated timezone in a country, or to select the timezone where the capital city is located? Why does it ignore the state you enter before?</p>
<p>For some reason I can&#39;t quite understand, I never had this trouble in Singapore.</p>
