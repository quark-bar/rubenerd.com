<p>I&#39;m sure we all knew that <a href="http://kde.org/">KDE</a> stood for the K Desktop Environment, but I also know none of us really knew why the <em>&quot;K&quot;</em> was significant. Just like the first <em>&quot;Q&quot;</em> in the <a href="//rubenerd.com/grilled-cheese-sandwich/">Automated Teller Machine</a> acronym <em>&quot;ATM&quot;</em>, I thought it was chosen because it&#39;s a letter used less often.</p>
<p>Fortunately my primary desktop machine didn&#39;t understand my sarcasm or sense of humour and decided to let me know what it was all about:</p>

<p>So <a href="http://freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> actually played a part in their decision! Well okay it was Unix-like operating systems in general, but good nonetheless right?</p>
