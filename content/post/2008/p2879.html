<p>We had a sweltering 36 degree day (98.something Fahrenheit) yesterday here in Adelaide; and if it wasn&#39;t bad enough even the breezes themselves felt like they were coming out of an oven. Fortunately it&#39;s a much cooler 27 degrees today, though UV is still &quot;extreme&quot;.</p>
<p>For comparison, Singapore generally averages 32 degrees (89.something Fahrenheit) during the day, every day, all year!</p>
