<cite>The Holden Commodore Omega, photo by <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:OSX">User:OSX</a>. Can we afford to have everyone driving such huge cars?</cite></p>
<p>I know I only wrote about this issue last week (<em><a href="//rubenerd.com/p2798/">Reduced profits of auto companies a good thing?</a></em>) but the headlines keep cropping up in Google Reader and I have to expand on my ideas again.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s two articles are about General Motors and their failing bottom line: to put it bluntly they&#39;re simply struggling with sharply reduced demand. Adelaide Now lets us know that Holden (GM&#39;s Australian subsidiary) is <a href="http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,24669781-2682,00.html">cutting back production again</a>. Time magazine asks whether or not <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1858702,00.html">General Motors is worth saving</a>.</p>
<p>As with other car companies, General Motors has a disproportionally greater responsibility over other companies to help us in our global effort to protect our environment, and so far their [lack of] fulfillment of their environmental obligations has been laughable. Due to a loophole in American law which does not impose more stringent fuel efficiency standards on light trucks and SUVs because they&#39;re not &quot;cars&quot;, the Big Three fell asleep behind their corporate wheels and didn&#39;t do anything while companies like Honda and Toyota have worked to improve efficiency and create hybrid technologies. They are certainly a <em>long</em> way from being perfect, but at least they&#39;re driving in the right direction.</p>

<p>I think General Motors should be given financial assistance, but only on the proviso that they wake up and starting taking the environment seriously: such funding should go towards developing more fuel efficient cars and researching alternative fuels, <em>NOT</em> towards restyling the bodywork on their current petrol-guzzlers for a new year range. They should also be supervised, and be encouraged to take seriously some brilliant, practical and unconventional ideas.</p>
<p>Such funding however should also be complimented by <em>much larger</em> government funding grants for the serious construction of public transport; this doesn&#39;t just apply to the United States. And I mean <em>serious</em>. Our planet cannot afford any more cars. It couldn&#39;t afford any more cars 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Only with a concerted and long term plan to improve public transport systems around the world will we see any change. We need to fundamentally rethink the way we get around this planet.</p>
