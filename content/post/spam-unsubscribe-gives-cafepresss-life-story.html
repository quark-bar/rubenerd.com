<p style="font-style:italic">Ruben picks apart the useless spam he receives from the spamming spammers who spam him with their spammingly spammish spam.</p>
<p><img src="http://files.rubenerd.com/uploads/media.logo_hween.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>I just clicked the &quot;unsubscribe&quot; link in one of the billions of spam messages I get from CafePress, and this was the friendly message I received:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have successfully opted out of the email cookie <strong>&quot;Aloha1WelComeV12_V1&quot;</strong> from domain <strong>&quot;info.cafepress.com&quot;</strong>.  This cookie had been unique and was used to help domain <strong>&quot;info.cafepress.com&quot;</strong> learn your interests in the content of these messages. Because you have converted your unique cookie to an  opt-out cookie, your interactions with this email can no longer be associated with you.Important &#8211; If you delete the opt-out cookie from domain <strong>&quot;info.cafepress.com&quot;</strong>, you will need to opt-out  again from domain <strong>&quot;info.cafepress.com&quot;</strong>. Please also note that opting-out from domain <strong>&quot;info.cafepress.com&quot;</strong> does not opt-out an individual person, or even an individual computer, but merely a single instance of a Web browser. Individual Web browsers do not share information with each other.  Therefore, if you are running both Netscape and Internet Explorer, you will need to go through the opt-out procedure for domain <strong>&quot;info.cafepress.com&quot;</strong> with both browsers.</p>

<p>For Pete&#39;s sake, all I wanted to do was unsubscribe to your useless newsletters which I never wanted in the first place, I don&#39;t need a lecture on how your cookie systems work.</p>
<p>Hold on a second… in the message it says &quot;learn your interests in the content of these messages&quot;. What does that mean? Are they keeping track of what I&#39;m clicking so they can target me with more relevent spam? Am I the only one who&#39;s received this message? This is scary stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway I&#39;ve tried to unsubscribe from this junk twice before, lets hope this try will work.</p>
<p><strong>Netscape and Internet Explorer</strong><br />
I am so fed up with seeing only these two browsers ever mentioned on any commercial site. Firefox? Camino? Safari? And who actually uses Netscape anymore?</p>
