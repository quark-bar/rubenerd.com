*Rubenerd* is a weblog, consisting of entries called posts that are sorted in chronological order. You can think of it as a personal journal, but meant to be read by the public:

* The [home page] always contains the ten most recent posts. You can use the pagination links at the bottom to go back and forward in time, but reading that one page is generally sufficient to keep up to date.

* Each post has an arrow alongside its heading on the home page, which links to each post individually. They too have pagination links at the bottom that let you read the next or previous post in the series. For example, [check out this post] about how to identify grilled cheese sandwiches.

* You can use the [archive page] if you're looking for a post on a specific topic, writing location, or year. Choosing one of these categories will give you a list of posts that match.

* If you read a lot of blogs, you can subscribe to them using their RSS feeds. Copy and paste [this feed link] into a blog reader such as Feedly or The Old Reader, and you'll be able to read posts in their entirety there.

* The [omake page] lists other content published on *Rubenerd* that doesn't fit anywhere else.
