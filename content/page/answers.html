<dt style="font-weight:bold">May I write a post advertising something? I'll pay you!</dt>
<dd>As long as I'm allowed to say you paid me, in bold letters. Which probably kills the whole grassrootsâ€“support you're trying to give the appearance of.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">You wrote about that solution, but why didn't you do X?</dt>
<dd>In the words of Merlin Mann, why am I not a potted fern?<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Why would you even want/need to do X?</dt>
<dd>Because I wanted/needed to?</p>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">LOL you used X! Or you're a sucker for thinking Y!</dt>
<dd>And yet you didn't find it pointless/stupid enough to avoid commenting. May I recommend this towel for wiping the egg off your face.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">You could have written that script in one line, or using this trick!</dt>
<dd>And for illustrative purposes, I didn't.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">I have a pedantic nitpick for you.</dt>
<dd>Can't see the forest for the trees? I suppose it's still a nice view.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Don't disparage GamerGate/blah, it's ethics in blah.</dt>
<dd>The second hand embarrasment is just too much. Next question?<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Why did you disable comments?</dt>
<dd>Because the pedants, trolls and spammers long outweighed the nice and constructive people. That said, I do publish comments I get at <a href="mailto:weblog2015@rubenschade.com">weblog2015@rubenschade.com</a> if they're the nice and/or constructive kind.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">I might not agree with everything you write, but thanks for all the fish.</dt>
<dd>Aww, thanks :). There aren't enough people like you.</dd>
