<dt style="font-weight:bold">Why not allow people to post comments?</dt>
<dd>Spam, and because this is my part of the web. You can comment in Twitter and <a href="mailto:weblog2015@rubenschade.com">through email</a>. Better yet, I encourage you to start your own blog, link to my post, and comment away.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">May I pay to write a guest post?</dt>
<dd>I used to say “sure, as long as I write that you that you paid for it”. Funnily enough, unsolicited advertisers dropped pretty fast after that.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">You used software/hardware X, why didn't you do/use Y?</dt>
<dd>In the words of Merlin Mann, why am I not a potted fern?</p>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Why would you even want/need to do X? And related, why use such an old/obscure technology?</dt>
<dd>Yeah, someone solving a problem is just the worst.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">When you said X, why didn't you mention Y?</dt>
<dd>Because it’s intuitively obvious, irrelevent to the broader point, or would just result in further pedantic inquiry. I heard you don’t like seeing the forest for the trees.</p>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">LOL you used X! Or you're a sucker for thinking Y!</dt>
<dd>And yet you didn’t find it pointless/stupid enough to avoid commenting. May I recommend <a href="">this towel</a> for wiping the egg off your face.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">You could have written that script in one line, or using this trick!</dt>
<dd>And for illustrative purposes, I didn’t.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Don't disparage GamerGate/blah, it’s ethics in blah.</dt>
<dd>See Poe’s Law.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Why is your taste in anime/music/movies so terrible?</dt>
<dd>Because it makes you angry.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">Why are you so full of shit?</dt>
<dd>Because I'm not a class act, like you.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-weight:bold">I might not agree with everything you write, but thanks for all the fish.</dt>
<dd>Thanks. The internet needs more people like you.</dd>
