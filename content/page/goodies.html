title: "Goodies"

<p>This area is for projets I'm working on, and stuff that doesn't fit elsewhere. It's named for the Goodies menu on my first Mac, a 1999 Blueberry iMac DV with Mac OS 8.6. You didn't need to know that, but here we are.</p>

<dd>This was the motherboard that powered my first computer, with a 200MHz Pentium MMX CPU and 4GB hard drive. This page discusses how to run this classic hardware in the 2010s, with info about pinouts, drivers, peripherals, and OS compatibility. I'm so happy I can still run this machine even today.<p></p></dd>
