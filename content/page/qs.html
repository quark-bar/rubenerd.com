<p>While I've closed blog comments, I still solicit replies from Twitter and email. Some of the best get published as posts. If you're intending to reply in the form of a question, make sure I haven't answered it here first.</p>

<dl>
<dt style="font-style:italic">Why not allow people to post comments?</dt>
<dd>Spam, and because this is my own little part of the web. I'd encourage you to start your own blog, link to my post, and comment away. Everyone has something interesting to say.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-style:italic">Aren't you just afraid of people calling you out?</dt>
<dd>No.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-style:italic">You used software/hardware X? Why not Y?</dt>
<dd>The situation, either by choice or necessity, called for X.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-style:italic">Why didn't you mention Y or [pendantic nitpick]?</dt>
<dd>Because I can see the forest for the trees.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-style:italic">Why didn't you do X?</dt>
<dd>In the words of Merlin Mann, why am I not a potted fern?<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-style:italic">Why would you solve such an obscure/old/irrelevent-to-me problem?</dt>
<dd>That time you use to complain? I solve problems with it instead.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-style:italic">Why are you so full of shit?</dt>
<dd>Because I'm not a class act, like you.<p></p></dd>

<dt style="font-style:italic">Why is your taste in anime/jazz/movies so terrible?</dt>
<dd>Because being bitter like you didn't work out for me.<p></p></dd>
