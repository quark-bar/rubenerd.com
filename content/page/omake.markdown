<h3 id="runs">What runs the site</h3>

* **[Hugo](http://gohugo.io):**
  Rather than using server-side software like WordPress, Rubénerd is generated from plain 
  HTML and Markdown into a static site. Only Hugo can process 4000+ posts written over a 
  decade without taking another decade to finish!

* **[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/):**
  I started using HTTPS with RapidSSL, but Let's Encrypt makes the whole process so simple. I
  can also generate them for all my subdomains without having to pay for a new cert each time.

* **[Bourne shell scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell):**
  This is the glue. It generates podcast pages, encodes audio, scales the images, and uploads
  the generated site. I use BSD, Mac, and Linux, so I avoid bashisms.

<h3 id="ran">What used to run the site</h3>

* **[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.org) (2013-15)**:
  My return to static-site generation after nearly a decade. *Rubénerd* was being delivered
  faster, used less resources, and had full revision history and tracking in a Git repo! Alas
  it took over 20 minutes to generate all my posts.

* **[WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) (2006-13)**:
  The Mac Daddy of blogging software. Movable Type had gone commercial at that stage, and
  Radio UserLand looked to be in its last throes, so I followed the pack to WordPress. For all
  the security issues and poorly written plugins, it served me surprisingly well for many
  years.

* **[RapidWeaver](http://realmacsoftware.com/rapidweaver/) (2005)**: 
  An intruiging and pleasent Mac application that generated static pages, but I soon ran into
  its limitations.

* **[Perl CGI scripts](http://perl.org/) (2004):**
  I wrote my first site engine when at my first job out of high school, before university
  started. It used CGI, which was a terrible idea but not enough people went to it to spawn
  too many threads, so I avoided disaster!

<h3 id="writing">How I write posts</h3>

* **[Vim](http://vim.org)**:
  I've used nano, joe, emacs (albeit briefly), TextMate, Sublime Text and Atom, but I keep
  coming back to this inexplicably wonderful mode of typing each time. I'm still learning new
  things with it, while likely forgetting other things.

* **[nvALT](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/)**: 
  A fantastic note-taking tool that splits ideas into separate, searchable text files. It's 
  akin to having your own text-based wiki.

* **[11" MacBook Air](http://www.apple.com/sg/macbook-air/)**:
  I'm still surprised how versitile this machine is. It fits on every coffee shop and 
  aeroplane table, but still packs enough punch for photo editing and dev work with a docking
  station and peripherals. All I miss is Parallels working fast enough for games, and the
  Retina screen from my work machine.

* **[Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard](https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/l5v-00001)**:
  I prefer mechanical keyboards, but went the split-keyboard route when I started getting
  upper-arm pain. It's surprisingly snappy, especially compared to the mushy plastic feel of
  the previous models.

* **[Michael Franks](http://www.michaelfranks.com/)**:
  My jam since I was a kid. He's a jazzy singler/songwriter with witty lyrics and albums for
  every mood and time of day stretching over his half-century career. Incidently, I wrote all
  but two of his albums on Wikipedia!

* **[AKG K551](http://us.akg.com/akg-product-detail_us/k551slv.html)**:
  I bought these headphones as per Marco Arment's recommendation. I'm not all about the bass
  (sorry Meghan Trainor) so these headphones sound amazing. The level of midrange detail
  continues to blow my socks off, and the giant pads are soft and comfortable.

* **[University of Technology, Sydney](http://uts.edu.au)**:
  Some incredible lecturers here, and even Steve Wozniak teachers here now! There must be a
  rule that UTS only accepts friendly people too; the Anime@UTS club was easily the best I've
  ever been a part of. Its also where my old man went to in the 1980s, so its a legacy :).

* **[University of South Australia, Adelaide](http://unisa.edu.au)**:
  My first place to study after high school, before going on extended leave for family reasons.
  The Mawson Lakes campus (and Adelaide itself) is beautiful, probably my favourite city in
  Australia.

* **[Australian Internationl School, Singapore](http://www.ais.com.sg)**:
  My primary and secondary school when we lived in Singapore. Ah AIS, so many memories, some of
  them good!

* **[Ascot State School, Brisbane](https://ascottss.eq.edu.au)**:
  My primary school when we lived briefly in Brisbane, Australia. A very traditional place,
  but fortunately they were fine me skipping religious classes to play with their recycled
  Apple IIs.

* **[Patterson Lakes Primary School, Melbourne](http://www.patterson-lakes-ps.vic.edu.au)**:
  My first primary school when we lived in Melbourne, Australia. I barely remember it, but my
  parents were really impressed.
