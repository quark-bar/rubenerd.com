<p>The word “taste” is paraded around as much as “nuance” in 2015 tech circles. Some people have it, others aspire to it, and all lament the lack of it in others.</p>

<p>Since 2010, I aimed to make <em>Rubénerd</em> more contemporary, tasteful, classy. What the cool people do. I switched to a blazing white theme, tried centering stuff, rendered thinner fonts, abstained from all images, and generally made everything look cookie-cutter, generic, and forgettable.</p>

<p>Then I realised something. <strong>There are enough of those sites out there</strong>. I'd make my own corner of the net as unique as dishwater.</p>

<p>Screw that.</p>

<p>So in the end, I reverted to my teenage-designed, 2005 colour scheme. Is it contemporary, tasteful and classy? Heck no. <strong>But it's mine</strong>.</p>

<p>It also presents tangible benefits. I can look at it with my excessive eye floaters. I find it soothing on my overworked eyes. It's less of a shock going from dark Vim terminal windows to it. I love how smoothly OS X renders light fonts.</p>

<p>I've also never loaded heavy JavaScript libraries or external fonts, and I'm not about to. That's my definition of taste.</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>
