<p>Since largely reverting <em>Rubénerd</em> to its original 2004 colour scheme, I figured there'd be people asking why this site looks like this.</p>

<p>Since 2010, I aimed to make Rubénerd more contemporary, tasteful, classy; whatever the cool people do. I switched to a blazing white theme, tried centering stuff, removed borders, rendering my fonts thinner, and generally made everything look cookie-cutter, generic, and forgettable.</p>

<p>Then I realised something. There are enough of those sites out there. I'd make my own corner of the net as unique as dishwater; which I suppose is unique insofar as the unique combination of suds and food scraps would be unlikely to be reproducable. So it was as unique as... something that isn't.</p>

<p>Screw that.</p>

<p>So in the end, I switched back. Is this theme contemporary, tasteful and classy? Heck no. But it's mine. I can look at it with eye floaters. As someone rapidly approaching his thirties, I find it soothing on my overworked eyes. It's less of a shock going from the dark Vim terminal windows I use to write it, to the published site.</p>

<p style="font-style:italic">(For a while, I even reverted back to XHTML+RDFa, before common sense prevailed. I do still prefer RDF syntax to needlessly-duplicated microdata, but that's for another discussion).</p>

<p>I've also never loaded heavy JavaScript libraries or external fonts, and I'm not about to. That's my definition of good taste.</p>
