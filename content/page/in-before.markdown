Most comments on technical posts end up divolving into several predictable anti-patterns. Rather than preempting them each time, I've included them below for future reference.

### 1. foo does more than bar.
The features of bar sufficient for mbarneeds.

### 2. But foo is better than bar.
More power to you. I use bar.

### 3. Why didn't you use foo?
Becuase I decided to use bar.

### 4. This wouldn't be a problem if you used foo instead of bar.
And for reasons, I used bar.

### 5. But foo is so obscure/expensive/cheap/etc, why use it?
Because I did.

### 6. It's not a problem with foo, it's [ancillary]
And the practical result is a problem with foo

### 7. Umm... [statement]
Prefacing with umm is superflous and rude, so I can only assume you must not be sure either.
