title: "The Fleet"

As I suspect with many of you, I grew up using computers. Our first home machine was a non-descript 486 SX, which I'd kill to have now.

### iYuki: The home machine

* 2012 11" MacBook Air
* Core i5 1.7GHz
* 8GiB 1600MHz DDR3 memory
* 64GiB TS064E SSD
* OS X 10.11 El Cappachino

This machine is still my primary workhorse after three years. She's light enough to carry everywhere, but can still handle Apple Photos and Vagrant VMs. At home, she's paired with a Thunderbolt dock to an external display and peripherals.

About all I miss is the retina screen from my work machine.

### Orion: The work machine

* MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)
* Core i7 2.2GHz
* 16GiB 1600MHz DDR3
* 256GiB SM0256F SSD
* Intel Iris graphics (darn!)

She has a stunning screen, but my days of lugging 15" laptops around Malaysia and Singapore with me are long since over! So she mostly stays plugged into peripherals on my desk at work.

### Tsuruya: The Game Machine

* [Intel Core 2 Duo e8400 3.0GHz](http://ark.intel.com/products/33910/)
* 4GiB 800MHz DDR2
* 64GiB Sandisk SSD
* Asus Nvidia GTX970 GPU
* 2x 2TB Hitachi 7200RPM drives, mirrored

My token Windows 7 gaming machine and iTunes server. She's slowly being upgraded piece by piece as my budget allows.

### Mio: The NAS

* HP ProLiant Microserver Gen8
* [Celeron G1610T 2.3GHz](http://ark.intel.com/products/71074)
* [Intel C204 chipset](http://ark.intel.com/products/52804/Intel-BD82C204-PCH)
* Mellanox MT26428 ConnectX QDR IB
* FreeBSD 10.3

One of my companion cubes! Used as a NAS, but without the sucky performance. Infiniband keeps certain folders in sync with Kyou for backups.

### Kyou: The Plex Machine

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2016/fleet-cube.jpg" alt="" style="width:146px; height:152px; float:right; margin:0 0 20px 20px;" /></p>

* HP ProLiant MicroServer Gen8
* [Intel C204 chipset](http://ark.intel.com/products/52804/Intel-BD82C204-PCH)
* Mellanox MT26428 ConnectX QDR IB

My second companion cube, bought from a former colleague. Used as a Plex storage and media server. CPU has enough grunt to transcode multiple streaming shows on an Apple TV and other desktops without skipping a beat, even those stupid Hi10P things.

### MMX: The Retro Machine

* [Intel Pentium MMX 200MHz](http://ark.intel.com/products/49966/Intel-Pentium-Processor-with-MMX-Technology-200-MHz-66-MHz-FSB)
* 256MiB PC-100, 32MiB 72-pin SIMM
* 8GiB CF card (HDD with CF to IDE adaptor)
* PCI Sound Blaster AWE64
* 32x Mitsumi CD-ROM
* Iomega 16x CD-RW
* Iomega 100MB Zip Drive 

This was the first machine I built myself back in primary school, and it still works 20 years later! Given we lost the old family 488, this machine has been a chimera with parts from the early 90s and late 90s to revel in nostalgia for both.
