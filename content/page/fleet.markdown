Despite badly trying my patience at work and home, computers remain my first love. I remember staring transfixed at the family 486 as a kid, and… I was about to say I knew it was my calling, but that’s clearly preposterous! I knew it was something special though, and everything in my life since has been in the direction of understanding, building and using these miraculous machines.

This page lists my current machines, old and new. I’m a hopelessly nostalgic fool who tends to spend more on retro hardware than contemporary.

### iYuki: The home machine

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2016/fleet-iyuki.jpg" alt="" style="width:152px; height:97px; float:right; margin:0 0 20px 20px;" /></p>

* 2012 11" MacBook Air
* Core i5 1.7GHz
* 8GiB 1600MHz DDR3 memory
* 64GiB TS064E SSD
* OS X 10.11 El Cappachino

This machine is still my primary workhorse after three years. She's light and small enough to carry to coffee shops and aeroplane tray tables, but can still handle Apple Photos and Vagrant VMs. At home, she's paired with a Thunderbolt dock to an external display and peripherals.

About all I miss is the retina screen from my work machine.

### Orion: The work machine

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2016/fleet-orion.png" alt="" style="width:152px; float:right; margin:0 0 20px 20px;" /></p>

* MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2014)
* Core i7 2.2GHz
* 16GiB 1600MHz DDR3
* 256GiB SM0256F SSD
* Intel Iris graphics (darn!)
* OS X 10.11 El Cappachino

I was given the choice of what hardware to use for work, and it really wasn't a contest. She has a stunning screen and decent performance, but is still probably too big to carry everywhere, so she mostly remains at the office.

### Tsuruya: The Game Machine

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2016/fleet-tsuruya.jpg" alt="" style="width:152px; float:right; margin:0 0 20px 20px;" /></p>

* Gigabyte GA-Z170N-WIFI
* Core i5 i6500 3.0GHz
* Intel Z170N chipset
* 16GiB Crucial 2133MHz DDR4
* 500GiB Samsung SSD
* Asus Nvidia GTX970 OC Edition
* Windows 7 Professional x64

I hadn't built a game machine since my teens, so this was an experiment to see what was the lightest, quietest, cheapest build I could make. The tiny, crowd-funded NCASE M1 is supurb, and harkens back to my recycled old PowerMac G5 and Mac Pro.

Her fairly pedestrian specs still run Cities Skylines, Train Simulator, Firewatch and other games **embarrasingly** better than my Macs. I love you Apple, but for Pete's sake! She runs Windows 7 to play this, because its the only Redmond OS I can stand, and her overwrought Aero Glass graphics are delightfully tacky.

Speaking of tacky, I wasn't planning to get a Samsung SSD, but got it from a colleage for a steal. Steam and Windows are drive hogs, so the original 60GB Sandisk wasn't going to cut it!

### Kyou: The Plex Companion Cube

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2016/fleet-cube.jpg" alt="" style="width:146px; height:152px; float:right; margin:0 0 20px 20px;" /></p>

* HP ProLiant Microserver Gen8
* [Xen](http://ark.intel.com/products/71074)
* [Intel C204 chipset](http://ark.intel.com/products/52804/Intel-BD82C204-PCH)
* 8GiB ECC DDR3
* 4x 4TB, mix of Hitachi, Toshiba WD in RAIDZ
* Mellanox MT26428 ConnectX QDR IB
* FreeBSD 10.3-RELEASE

It amazes me how affordable these server-grade boxes are. I use this one as a NAS, bhyve hypervisor, gateway, transcoder, torrent box, Plex media server and basically anything else I can delegate away from my laptops. In her spare time she runs Folding@Home at half-speed to keep her running cool.

### Mio: The Fort Knox Backup Cube

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2016/fleet-cube.jpg" alt="" style="width:146px; height:152px; float:right; margin:0 0 20px 20px;" /></p>

* HP ProLiant MicroServer Gen8
* [Celeron G1610T 2.3GHz](http://ark.intel.com/products/71074)
* [Intel C204 chipset](http://ark.intel.com/products/52804/Intel-BD82C204-PCH)
* 4GiB ECC DDR3
* 2x 3TB Hitachi in ZFS mirrored vdev
* 2x 2TB Hitachi in ZFS mirrored vdev
* Mellanox MT26428 ConnectX QDR IB
* Oracle Solaris 11

Mio is my primary data backup server, with a tinge of university nostalgia for the old SunOS I used to write Java remotely on. Oracle Solaris 11 is closed source again (sigh), but has native ZFS encryption and handles being an rsync target just fine thanks to the tireless <a href="https://www.opencsw.org/">OpenCSW</a> team.

### MMX: The Retro Machine

* [Intel Pentium MMX 200MHz](http://ark.intel.com/products/49966/Intel-Pentium-Processor-with-MMX-Technology-200-MHz-66-MHz-FSB)
* 256MiB PC100, 32MiB 72-pin SIMM
* 8GiB CF card (with IDE adaptor)
* PCI Sound Blaster AWE64
* 32x Mitsumi CD-ROM
* Iomega 100MB Zip Drive 
* MS-DOS 6.20, Windows 3.11

This was the first machine I built myself back in primary school, and it still works 20 years later! Given we lost the old family 488, this machine has been a chimera with parts from the early 90s and late 90s to revel in nostalgia for both.


### GeeThree

* Apple B&W PowerMac G3
* 256MiB PC100 SDRAM
* 32GiB CF card (with IDE adaptor)
* Sonnet IDE controller
* Apple branded DVD-ROM
* Mac OS 8.6

My first Macs were an iMac DV and an iBook, but both long stopped working. I bought this machine second hand in Adelaide for $10, and have slowly been decking it out as another nostalgia box. 


### Libretto

* Toshiba Libretto 70CT
* Intel Pentium MMX 133MHz
* 32MiB PC66 SDRAM
* 16GB CF card (with IDE adaptor)
* 640x480 Display
* Windows NT 4.0 Workstation
* FreeBSD 10.3-RELEASE i386

I badly wanted this VHS-tape sized computer as a kid, so a few years ago I finally bought one. I originally had her running DOS, but the graphics drivers did weird dithering I couldn't stand.


### Lum the Commodore

* Commodore Plus/4
* MOS Technology 8501, 1.76 MHz
* 64KiB RAM, 64KiB ROM
* MOS TED, 320×200, 121 colors

I was born too late for the home computer revolution of the mid 1980s, so I bought this tiny machine for peanuts in the early 2000s. It doesn't have the advanced sprites of the 64, but I love the design. It also has a newer version of Commodore Basic and four rather terrible bundled applications that are fascinating historial artefacts.


### In Memory

* Apple iMac DV, blueberry
* Apple iBook G3, dual USB
* HP Brio BAx, Pentium III tower
* IBM ThinkPad 600E
* IBM ThinkPad X40
* DIY tower, Core 2 Duo E8400 in an Antec 300
