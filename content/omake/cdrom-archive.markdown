I used to collect multimedia CD-ROMs from the 1990s. They were huge during that brief period when the internet was too slow for multimedia, but computers were fast enough to render images and video.

I decluttered most of my collection in 2017, save for a choice few of my favourites. The rest now live as digital ISOs on that wonderful online repository of the Internet Archive.
