This is my evolving list of the best brews I find.

### Sydney

* [Tartine](https://www.facebook.com/tartine2020/): Best coffee and café food in Sydney. They're not your parents' jaffles.

* [Two Black Sheep](http://twobblacksheep.com.au/): Best coffee in the Sydney CBD, and the owners/operators are lovely. I wish I could speak more Thai.

* [Central Roasters](http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/central-roasters-sydney-2): Tucked away in a side-street you may not see. Your loss, their coffee is great!

* [Workshop Espresso](http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/restaurants/venues/4906/workshop-espresso): In the Galleries building, a great place for a cup after buying another stack of manga from Kino. They always have something fun on their blackboard.

### Adelaide

* [The Boatdeck Cafe](http://theboatdeck.com.au/): Much of this site in the mid-2000s was written from this place. They don't do the Betty Blue Sea of Espresso any more, but still best coffee in northern Adelaide!

### Brooklyn, New York

* [L'imprimerie](http://limprimerie.nyc/): Beautiful little café down from the L/M Myrtle-Wyckoff Avenues subway. Best coffee in New York, and the people are super friendly.
