This page details the computers I currently use, including vintage ones. I've got plenty sitting in storage I'll add one day.


### MacTheKnife-J, the 13" 2018 MacBook Pro

This is my work machine, for running all the usual business application suspects. The screen is gorgeous, he's relatively light, and his TouchBar and keyboard are appauling. My primary Mac is always *MacTheKnife*, because I'm funny like that.

* **OS:** macOS Mojave 10.14
* **Shell:** oksh (OpenBSD portable ksh)
* **Desktop:** Aqua, Xfce on XQuartz


### Umu, the Panasonic CF-RZ6 FreeBSD laptop

This is my primary portable machine, named for the catchphrase [Nero-chan](https://grandorder.gamepress.gg/servant/nero-claudius) says in *Fate*. I bought her in Akihabara after AsiaBSDCon 2019. She's implausibly light, quick, and still has more ports than a new MacBook Pro.

* **Desktop:** i3
* **Display:** 10.1-inch 1920Ã—1200 HiDPI

### Kyou, the HP MicroServer Gen8 bhyve box

<p><img src="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/fleet-companioncube@1x.jpg" srcset="https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/fleet-companioncube@1x.jpg 1x, https://rubenerd.com/files/2019/fleet-companioncube@2x.jpg 2x" alt="" style="width:128px; float:right; margin:0 0 1em 2em;" /></p>

This is my FreeBSD bhyve hypervisor, NAS, Plex streaming server, web proxy, sandbox, kitchen sink, CD ripper, and home router in one. She's named for Kyou from the mid 2000's Kyoani anime Clannad, because she kicks arse.

### Mio, the Toshiba Libretto 70CT
