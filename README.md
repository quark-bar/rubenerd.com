# rubenerd-hugo

This is the source for *[Rubénerd](http://rubenerd.com)*, a weblog and podcast of esoteric interests by Ruben Schade in s/Singapore/Sydney/.

Tested and used on FreeBSD and OS X. I don't care about Linux, but should work.

## Dependencies
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) – previously svn, forcing myself to learn!
* [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) 0.14 or above – the beautiful static site generator written in Go
* Bourne compatible shell – portable, without \[\[ bashisms \]\], for BSD
* BSD sed, awk – tried to be portable, should work with GNU
* [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/), [OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/) – for secure ∆ updates, transfers

---- 

## Previous dependencies
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) – static site generator, easy to use but very slow
* [Perl](http://perl.org) – still my first love, but replaced with shell scripts for portability
